1,"The King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious practice to assert power, maintain social control, and prepare for conflicts, despite external pressures and the introduction of Christianity.","The claim that the King of Dahomey perpetuated human sacrifices as a deeply entrenched cultural and religious practice to assert power, maintain social control, and prepare for conflicts is addressed differently in the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not explicitly mention human sacrifices by the King of Dahomey as a cultural or religious practice. Instead, it focuses on the economic transition in Dahomey from the slave trade to palm oil trade under King Gezo, influenced by external pressures and the introduction of Christianity. This absence of information on human sacrifices suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the specific assertion about these practices being used for power assertion and social control. In contrast, The African Times articles provide detailed accounts supporting the claim, describing the King's annual customs involving the killing of captives and human sacrifices as part of religious ceremonies like the Attor and Sorsi customs. These practices were deeply rooted in Dahomian culture and were seen as essential for maintaining the King's prestige and authority. The articles also highlight the King's resistance to external pressures, including those from the British and Christian missionaries, to abolish these practices. Despite the introduction of Christianity, the King continued these customs to assert his power and control over his subjects, using human sacrifices to prepare for conflicts, such as threats to invade Abeokuta and sacrifices made before war expeditions. Thus, while the textbook focuses on economic and religious transitions, the news articles emphasize the cultural and religious significance of human sacrifices in Dahomey and the King's determination to uphold these practices despite external influences.","The provided paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not explicitly mention the practice of human sacrifices by the King of Dahomey as a cultural or religious practice.

Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.\nThere was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities.

For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife.

The Christian missionaries, like the Muslims, did not content themselves with banning only the performances.

Similarly, the chiefs of Jiibo received gifts at 'salutations' and levied a tax on salt for which traders were liable. Aristocrats were sometimes attended by hundreds of dependants.

By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land. Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""Mirambo's method of control in his 'empire' was based on the imposition of military power on the traditional system..Conquered rulers were required to acknowledge his over-rule by occasionally sending him tributes of ivory and young men for his army. Where there was resistance from a traditional ruler, Mirambo removed him and replaced him with a more submissive member of the same ruling family. Where a conquered province was near a powerful kingdom, Mirambo kept armed men of his own there. But his main method of control was that of keeping his army constantly on the move to intimidate both his neighbours and his subjects.\nNyungu ya Mawe's 'empire' was better integrated than that of Mirambo. Nyungu ya Mawe, like Mirambo, used the ruga-ruga to establish himself among the Kimbu. Between 1870 and 1880 he campaigned from his base in Kiwele and gained control of the trade route to the coast east of Tabora and the southbound route from Tabora to Ufipa and Lake Tanganyika. Among the conquered states Nyungu posted his own officials called vatwale, who were directly responsible to him. In his 'empire' the real rulers were no longer the traditional chiefs but the appointed vatwale. It was the duty of these officials to collect and forward to Nyungu all the ivory obtained in the kingdom. The area under each appointed official consisted of a number of traditional states. Therefore the Kimbu traditional states, num› bering about thirty, were ruled by about six or seven vatwale. 11 Mirambo and Nyungu ya Mawe were contemporaries. Both built up polities based on the changed material conditions of the late nineteenth century. Both Nyungu and Mirambo died in 1884. Because Nyungu made innovations in the administrative structure of his 'empire', when he died it survived until it was dismantled by the colonialists. On the other hand, Mirambo's 'empire' broke up into its constituent states simply because there was no successor who could maintain the strong army required to keep it together."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': ""A feature of this syncretism was observance of Catholic feast days and saints' days, together with recourse to the orixas and to voodoo.

The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom. The next day the slaves were delivered to the King; the very old ones were put aside to be killed, the young and the middle-aged were put aside to be sold.\n\nFive days after this the second warriors returned with more than 200 slaves.

He put his own construction on this story.\n\nOne hopeful circumstance, however, appeared. The King seemed wishful to receive communications from the Government of England, and disappointed that those which had been opened with his father had not been continued. There seems reason to think that a properly-accredited messenger would not be unwelcome; and should the duties of his mission be judiciously discharged, it is possible that much good might result. The subject deserves the best consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government, with a view to some immediate action that might be instrumental in averting the threatened attack from Abeokuta. The King said that the Queen of England was great among the white people, while he, the King, was great among the black. The King had on a former occasion allowed Mr. Bernasko to take half-a-dozen children from Abomey to Whydah to educate.

He describes the Lagoon between the sea and Badagry as having tens of thousands of palm trees (oil) about it. Two Dahoman King's messengers were there, and took Mr. Craft under their protection, as is customary when a stranger arrives anywhere in the country seeking the King. On the 18th he left Badagry in canoe for Porto Novo. There he was received by the King, who expressed great friendship for him. The King told him he had given over his country to the French. He offered, however, to send a messenger up to Abomey with him; *but the French authorities did not approve of this, and would not allow it.*\n\nOn the 21st he left Porto Novo in a large canoe for Godomey, which is in Dahomey proper, and about eighteen miles from Whydah. The entrance to the creek is very narrow, he says, and the creek itself not more than five or six feet wide—very crooked—shallow—and overhung with thick jungle. No stranger, he thinks, could find the entrance. But when within six or eight\n**[JUNE 23, 1863.]**\n\nmiles of Godomey, the Lagoon is as much as, eight or ten miles wide.

On the night of the 27th inst. Prince Gbo, who succeeded the King during his absence, called upon me where I put up. We sat in long conversation, and I seized an opportunity to direct it to the subject of religion, and asked him whether he would not like to have the Gospel preached in his country. Poor man! he could not understand what I meant by the terms ""preaching the Gospel,"" but after a little explanation he seemed to like it, but confessed that nothing of the kind could be allowed to be introduced into his country without the sanction of the King of Dahomey. On Monday morning, the 28th inst., having procured carriers, we left for the next station, about eight to twelve miles from Godome, where we hoped to procure a canoe for Whydah. Along the way from Godome to the wharf is occupied by an extensive course of water about three or four feet deep, and no stranger can get through without going by hammock. Accordingly I procured one, to be carried by four men. Leaving Godome at seven, we went through, and whilst two men bore the hammock upon their shoulders, the other two had to raise me up by the shoulders and waist, so as to prevent my being dragged along through the water: this occupies a course of about five to six miles\' distance. As there are many custom-houses by the way, to whose officers we were bound to pay tribute, my guide told me that we should endeavour to secure Prince Gbo\'s staff, as he is the senior officer of the customs, excepting those in the Whydah station; by this means we should pass along unmolested. I accordingly availed myself of the opportunity of securing this. It is three feet long, the head is carved exactly like a man\'s right hand held or stretched out. If a man hold out his right hand with his fingers stretched out he sees the staff to which I am alluding. I got to the next station early, about 9.30, for my carriers moved as fast as they could, and then waited for the rest of the carriers, who got to the station about eleven o\'clock. My guide then delivered the staff to the officer of this station—a wild and hungry-looking fellow of about fifty years of age. This man became angry on seeing this staff, because it prevented him from perpetrating his intentions. Notwithstanding this, he insisted upon the opening of my boxes. My guide, who is one of them, and knows their uncivil behaviour, told me to open them. I refused, alluding to the staff for my security. He then went and ransacked my guide\'s boxes and other luggage, deprived him of all his provisions, &c., seized and took away five of my mats which were to have covered me in the canoe, and told my guide to tell me I must pay something. I was obliged to make him a present of some money, besides the things he had seized, ere I was permitted to proceed. Having secured a canoe and men, we left this station for Whydah at 12.30. This is one of the principal stations of the King of Dahomey, in which a Wesleyan Society had flourished for some time. We had a pleasant voyage all along; but at length our canoe unfortunately ran upon a stump and narrowly escaped being capsized. On the morning of the 29th inst. I engaged a man to take me upon his shoulders, and had to walk about two hours in water three or four feet deep along the way to Whydah. As this is a chief station, we of necessity called here and obtained permission, else we would not be permitted to proceed. After visiting several persons in the place, and viewing other parts of the country, in which I noticed its populated state, the prosperity of trade, the beauty of the country itself, as well as its fine buildings, I thought what a sad thing indeed it is that a country possessed of such resources has not a single church or chapel to adorn or complete its beauty! As my guide told me we should get to my station the next day, or the third day at the longest time, and being resolved to proceed to Aguay that evening, I asked him to proceed with me to the palace of Prince Dinadu, and obtained permission to go away and get to my station in time. Accordingly we proceeded. But a minute or two before we left, Mr. Buko, our landlord, mentioned that he heard it noised abroad that the English Government were sending men as spies to Whydah. I told him I had heard nothing of the kind. Before this time it appears a similar report had gone forth informing the Prince that there are spies in the land; and, as we were bound to see him before we left, he was prepared also to meet us. Our landlord accompanied us to the palace of the Prince, who seemed to be exceedingly angry at our presence, and manifested a feeling totally unfriendly at the onset. Mr. Buko, our spokesman, knelt down, clapped his hands together several times, told him our mission, and besought him to grant us permission to pass to Little Popo, where we expect to begin our work. He inquired of me, through the interpreter, ""Why did not the Wesleyan Missionary Society build the chapel there before sending men to take possession of it?"" I said to my guide that there had been a chapel not only there, but even in Whydah, as well as Augway, &c., but these had been broken up. But for the good of the people and the instruction of the children this Mission wishes to renew these societies, and for this cause they sent me. On hearing this he was exasperated, and ordered us to return immediately by the way we came, and inform him by whom we were sent, that we have no permission or authority to proceed thither. All along from Dahomey beyond Popo is under the King\'s jurisdiction. Our Superintendent must write a letter of inquiry to the King of Dahomey and the princes or chiefs about his kingdom, so that due consideration might be given to the subject. As I had suffered a little from ill health shortly before I undertook my journey this way, I pleaded to obtain permission to have my course through Popo, not far from Whydah, so that I might return by the mail packet to Lagos, as the way through which I came to Whydah is rather tedious. Here he said he would not hear from me a word more, but I should return immediately by the way I came. He then called out, and a wild-looking gentleman presented himself, knelt down before him, and clapped his hands together several times. Upon his person we observed scores of keys suspended about his neck and waist. This he did to frighten me away. This individual I conjecture to be the keeper of the doors of the prison. On seeing this I became thoroughly convinced and satisfied that evil was determined upon, and that danger was at hand if I persisted. I beckoned to my guide and landlord, the latter kneeling and clapping his hands several times: we then bowed and retired from the palace. On returning to our landlord\'s house, we found him much troubled about this matter. We had thought at first to pass the night in Whydah, as the day was far gone; but having now found that we were becoming obstacles in the way of our landlord, we thought it most prudent to retire. There are scores of towns and villages situated on either side of the river which I saw on my way to Whydah. Also from Lagos up to Porto Novo we find scores of towns and villages on either side of the river. — *Wesleyan Magazine.*\n'}, {'id': 3128, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY: ITS KING AND PEOPLE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_06_1876', 'content': 'The King of Dahomey has not realized the expectations we last month hazarded respecting him. Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the'}, {'id': 3164, 'article_title': 'The Adventures of S.

As we went out we saw the Dahomians coming towards us, and went to meet them, not knowing that some Dahomians had already placed themselves in ambush. We halted, fired, and then wheeled round, and ran to save our lives. Those in ambush in our rear now came out and fired at us. Some had guns and others matchets and club sticks. I got to within about twenty yards of the gate when one of the Dahomians struck me violently on the back with his club and I fell down on my face to the ground. I was taken up, tied with rope, and taken to the camp; was in the Dahomian camp for about five days, and then sent under Dahomian escort, with about 800 egbas (men and women), that were caught and taken captives about the farms to Abomey; two old soldiers (pensioners) were amongst the lot. We were eleven days on the way from Abeokuta to Abomey, the capital of Dahomey. Several captives who were wounded, including one of the old soldiers, died on the way, and were thrown into the bush like beasts. We were fed with either roast corn or casada, taken from the farms by the Dahomians. We were all tied severally with ropes: at times we ate food once a day, at other times twice. On arrival at Abomey we were all put in chains—by the neck—remained in sitting posture; fed with either agidi, casida, or farina, with ground pepper and salt. We were locked up in a large compound. About fifteen days after our reaching Abomey, the king arrived with his army and some more captives. We were all taken out and brought before responsible chiefs. A fetish priest brought some fetish water in a pot mixed with some ingredient, and gave us each to drink. Those who leant back after drinking one or two glasses of this mixture are put by to be killed; those who sit upright are saved, and destined to be sold into slavery. About 300 leant back and were killed by the king's executioner, at the rate of fifty per day. I saw it all; I was among the saved ones. About a month afterwards I was sold with others to a chief called Wenu, of Arada, a village of about half an hour's journey from Abomey; he bought me for forty bags of cornes, 25f. Although I was born in Liberia and speak and write English, I was very careful not to let them know it, otherwise the king would not have sold me, nor would I afterwards be able to run away. My new master placed me to work in the farm planting yams, corn, casada, etc., and at times sent me in company of other slaves to Whydah to fetch rolls, tobacco, goods, cowries, and rum. When the English Commodore's ship came to Whydah, in February last, to see about some matters, was sent to fetch goods, and I saw some of the officers on shore. I managed to speak to one of the naval officers, recounting my trouble, and he said if I could manage to get on board one of the men-of-war ships, all right; but it was difficult, as the Dahomian authorities at Whydah are very particular with slaves. On the 15th May I was sent again to Whydah, in company of sixty slaves, to fetch goods. We reached Whydah on Wednesday, about 7 o'clock p.m. I told the chief I was going to the yard, where we lodge for the night, and I took occasion to go down the beach unperceived by any one; and by the sea shore I passed all the Custom offices in the different stations; the officials were all asleep. I travelled all night and reached Godomey at 4 o'clock a.m. I went and hid myself in the bush, as it was unsafe for a runaway slave to travel by day. On Thursday evening, at about 7 o'clock, I came out of the bush, and proceeded on my way to Kotonu. I arrived there at midnight. I went in to some of the Cape Palmas Kis-boys, in the employ of Regis Aine's house, and as I could talk the Kiss language, they took me in and hid me in their room. In the afternoon of Friday some canoes arrived from Porto Novo with produce. On returning I succeeded, through the Kissboyso in making arrangement with the Causenien, and I came away with them on Saturday night, and arrived in Porto Novo about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning. I lodged at the house of Senor Bambera. On Monday, the 22nd instant, I saw the steamer Renner in the river, and I went off to the owner on board and told him my trouble. He kindly gave me a free passage to Lagos. We left Porto Novo on Wednesday night, and reached Lagos on Thursday, the 25th instant. Seeing Lagos once more, I thank God for His mercies and safe deliverance. Whilst at Arada the king, who left home with his army in January last, on their usual expedition to Abeokuta and other places, sent home some slaves that he had recently captured from a village. Elated with this he went to Meks; he drove the people into the town; but, mustering efforts, the Meks people drove him out with great loss. About the fines imposed by the Commodore, the king sent to tell the chiefs at home that he will not pay; that he bought nothing from the English Government; but, as for his debt he owed some of the merchants he will pay them; that if the English wanted to fight him, the Commodore must send him notice beforehand, and not take him by surprise. On that account he sent orders and many fetish were made and sacrifices offered to them. A small wooden vessel was made to represent an English ship of war; they bore it fore and aft and, passing chains through it, suspended it, and decorated it with flags, blue, while, and red, put small anchor to it, as well as fetish—the vessel rested on a platform built of mud;—this implied that if the English men-of-war came to fight them the ships would be unable to move, and the Dahomian army will easily get them on the beach, and haul them up on shore. I saw human sacrifices offered to three idols or gods: one is in a house built with human blood and mud, and decorated with the skulls; another built with human blood, mud, and different kinds of beads; and the third built of different pattern of cloth in wooden frame. Before the king left home in January last on his expedition, several hundreds of the captives were killed and offered as sacrifices, several sent to be sold to the westward countries. I saw several slaves for mere trifling things done were tied up and flogged severely, till blood flowed from the body; others are beaten with club-sticks. I was flogged twice, and the marks on my person are evidence. I was nearly dead, and I resolved to escape by the first opportunity. I hope the day will soon come when Dahomey will be taken by England, or at least be made to feel its power.""}, {'id': 5279, 'article_title': 'Serious Troubles at Porto Novo', 'full_section_title': 'Serious Troubles at Porto Novo', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-19', 'issue_date': '01_12_1885', 'content': 'Recent news from Lagos, *via* Paris, reports that Porto Novo, which is under French protection, is in a state of consternation, and the European traders are clamouring to be protected.

They fired ten important villages and some trading stations, killing all the elderly people, and carrying away all the able-bodied and children. This incursion is ascribed to a religious motive. The Amazons have depopulated the districts bordering on that of Porto Novo to appease the hunger of the evil spirits, who, the priests teach them, feed in some mysterious manner on those sacrificed to them. They have therefore, in their dread of their maleficent divinities, been emboldened to invade a territory which, being under French protection and enjoying an immunity from the sacrificial tax, is thickly populated. Sometimes as many as eight hundred human beings are offered up at Dahomey as a hecatomb. The most robust female children taken prisoners of war are reserved for the Amazonian corps, which now amounts to 4,000. They are entirely consecrated to martial purposes, and obliged under capital penalty to remain vestals.

There I could hear nothing but the war cry. Every man I approached on the subject of Christianity would answer me something about the war. I said to a great many persons that they ought to throw away their gods, serve the Great God, and become Christians, but they would generally say, ""We will see about it after the war is over."" The great multitudes scorn the cause of Christ, and serve their idols. I went with a friend to Porto Novo, a city about the same distance from Lagos as Abeokuta. The city and its country have a population of 90,000. Soon after our arrival we went to salute the King (Tofa). We found him to be a very intelligent-looking man. We told him that we came to see if he would allow us to come and live in his country, build a school and chapel, and teach his people the Christian\'s religion. He said he only knew two religions—viz., the Wesleyans and Catholics; those were enough, and he wanted no other religion in his country. We attempted to tell him that we all taught the same religion, but he soon stopped us by saying, ""I have no more to say on the subject."" He is a great tyrant, and much devoted to his gods. Just a few days before we went there he sacrificed twenty human souls to his gods. He has about three hundred wives, and told us that he had a very strict law, which prohibited us speaking to any woman or girl, as they were all his wives there. When we meet a woman or girl, we must give half of the walk and not touch them. He had a bottle of beer and lemonade brought for us to drink. After a little more talk we took a glass of lemonade and left with the understanding that we could look at his town if we let the women pass. On leaving his palace we noticed in his yard some half-dozen or more gods. These gods are to be seen by the thousands. Many of the heathen temples are decorated with human skulls, which have been offered as sacrifices to the gods. In one of these temples I counted as many as thirteen. I saw a dog that had been killed, no doubt as a sacrifice, and tied to the neck of one of the gods in the market. A German merchant there had one of the native boys to steal some money from him. He took him to the King to be punished for the deed. The King said, ""All right; I will try by one of my gods; if I find him to be guilty I will punish him."" The merchant said, ""I don\'t believe in your fetishes."" ""What,"" said the King, ""you don\'t believe in my gods!

Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live. You go about kidnapping and killing people who never harmed you—who don\'t even know you. You prevent commerce, you hinder civilization, you create misery and desolation, you break up hundreds of thousands of happy families. This will not do. The world really can\'t get on in this manner.

Their heads were, of course, hanging downwards. The men were there left to die. The traders, as they proceeded along, were unwilling witnesses of a frightful sacrificial execution. They saw a number of natives in a group, and went to the spot to see what was taking place. To their horror they saw a native tied by the feet and neck. The rope to the neck was thrown over a tree in one direction, and the rope attached to the feet was tied to a tree in the opposite direction. The ropes were then drawn tightly, and when the body was distended to its utmost length, another native with a hatchet struck the neck, and severed the head from the body.

This venerable king has carried his good feelings towards the English to his grave. A week or two before he sent me to arrange order at Ahwodyah, from whence I wrote last. One Kucku Mainsah, of Chimah, a Dutch subject, was brought to him to be killed. This Kucku Mainsah and his wife had been long residents in this district, and he had pawned himself and wife to an Akim man who also had been trading here. This Kucku Mainsah could not be got to fight against his own people; he was employed by his master in trading between this and the coast, and finding the quarrel was over-ruled a little on the coast by the British influence over the acknowledged people in the Protectorate, so that a communication was opened between Eemina and Cape Coast, he ran away to Chimah, and made way to the place where he left his wife, to steal her away. Being caught, unfortunately, he was brought here to be killed. I being then in the town, interfered, and with many forcible arguments and his friendly feeling towards the English, notwithstanding the many discouragements he had met in attempting to own still the English, I conquered him, and he told the master to send him away out of his district to Akim, where I entertained no more fear about the man's life, that being in the Protectorate. I, however, lament to say that because his wife is fair to look upon, and the master wished to keep her, he sent him away to Akim without her, and ordered him to be killed. Having got information of his death and convicted the master, who is of the Protectorate, I am trying to get him punished.\n\n7.

The superstitious notions of people so far in the interior respecting human sacrifices being only kept down by British influence, and not by the Christian religion, the temptation is rather too strong for a people in a state like this to resist; and one well acquainted with their habits cannot be surprised to hear what has taken place in this district since the death of their remarkable king. They have sacrificed about thirty persons. Several with whom I am well acquainted, since I arrived on the 3rd inst., both the heir and the chiefs of his body guard, desired me to remain until a king is placed on the stool; and knowing that there is greater customs to be made yet, because none of his great captains and chiefs that compose the district had appeared, and that they are expected to bring over thirty persons to be sacrificed, I have made the cessation of human sacrifice the condition of my staying with them.

Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate. And it is very much to be deplored that—in a place where a clever and energetic missionary has for so many years exercised a humanising and civilising influence, and where the people, by a little severity applied with a firm and judicious hand, can be so easily deterred from such acts—they should be perpetrated with impunity, and that further outrages of a like description should be enacted which will be the case unless immediate and energetic measures be taken for their prevention.—Yours always,', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HUMAN SACRIFICES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Sunday morning, December 4, the Rev.

One of them is offered sometime between July and August to Esu, the Devil, the author of all ills, whose anger and cruelty they dread, and whom they would conciliate. Another is offered sometime between September and October, as we afterwards learnt, to Oramafe, the divinity at Ife, the cradle of the human family, after the Yoruba tradition, who gives to the earth its fatness. This is a thanksgiving offering for the blessing of harvest which he gives. Yam being amongst Yorubas, and especially among Ijeshas, the staple food, the sacrifice and offering is made during the yam harvest, and the divinity to whom it is presented is represented in the shape of a yam, made of brass. Some chiefs have counselled their abolition, but the priests, Babalawos, to whom this service is a source of gain and influence, are very actively opposed to it, and would not sanction it. The power of the priesthood in heathendom here is by no means to be despised. The people are certainly priest-ridden.

On Tuesday I therefore prepared to start, and, while so doing, was told that on account of the rains that had been pouring during the night, Ashantees on their way to Kumasi had had to return, because the rivers could not be crossed. I was told it was impossible to travel that day, and, not being able to help myself, said we must wait till the morrow. On Wednesday morning we left Bogyawai at six o'clock. We had travelled six hours when we again met two messengers from the King. He still said that we must remain at Bogyawai until Thursday week. I answered that this was impossible, that I should travel as far as Kasi, a village half an hour's walk from Kumasi, and that they must return to tell the King of it. I again urged that if the King detained me too long, I should be obliged to remain in Kumasi the whole of the rainy season, which I was determined not to do. The next day they brought me a message somewhat more satisfactory. I had permission to enter Kumasi on Monday. I had, therefore, to wait only three days at Kasi. Sunday evening, just as I was preparing for evening service, a woman was brought to me in tears and in great distress. She said she had come from Amoaful, for me to save her sister. The King had that day sent messengers to the chief, telling him that her sister, who was of the family of the King of Juabin, must be first sacrificed at the commencement of a custom just about to be kept for the slain chiefs during the war. She was already in log, and if I did not interfere she would soon be killed. The poor woman entreated so much, saying that she had a few days before seen her aged mother sacrificed, that I felt greatly moved. I sent for the King's two messengers who were with me, and told them I wished one of them to go to the King at once, and ask him for my sake to spare that woman. The King acceded to my request, a messenger was sent after the woman, and in three days she was brought to me in Kumasi. Her two children, one three years of age and the second a babe at the breast, had been taken from her, and she was very uneasy about them. After much difficulty I had them brought and restored to the mother the very day I left Kumasi. On Monday, April 10th, at nine A.M. we started for Kumasi. We were conducted into a new path recently cut through the bush, but by which I was told all Europeans had to enter Kumasi. This path brought us to the end of a long and wide street leading to the palace. Here we sat till we received intelligence from the King as to our future movements. After waiting half an hour, a messenger came to say that the King wished me to go to our lodgings, and take breakfast before the reception. I lodged in Prince Ansah's hut, which is quite near to the Mission grounds. Soon after our arrival some Elmina men, who had been some months trading in Kumasi, came to pay me their respects. They gave me a most horrible account of human sacrifices during the preceding week. There had been some every day, and the number on Saturday, when the King went to Bantama, was twenty-six! Sixteen were killed at Bantama, and when the King returned to town ten were killed in the market place. At three P.M. I was told the King was ready to give me a reception. Stepping out of doors, I was half-startled, but much amused, by being confronted by a foolish-looking fellow with a peacock's tail outspread on the top of his head, and covered with gold plates and ornaments from head to toe. In his hand was a gold-handled sword, which indicated that he was to be my guide. We followed him in single file, all my carriers walking before me. We were conducted through the market-place, then down another street, leading past the Stone Palace, now in ruins, then, turning to the left, went up another street, at the top of which is a large open space, where sat the King, his chiefs, with their captains, and numerous armed attendants; also the Queen-mother and a large company of women. They were all seated in a half circular line, each chief being under a large umbrella. I walked along the whole line, being introduced and shaking hands with all the chiefs and captains, more than one hundred in number. The King was seated about ten yards in the rear of the middle of the line, with a large number of attendants on either side of him. To him I simply raised my hat, while his attendants shouted his honours, even calling him the Possessor of Heaven and Earth. Having paid him my respects, I was conducted to another place, where I had to sit and receive theirs. They came in procession. Each of the chiefs was preceded by beating of drums and followed by armed men. They were carried in baskets on men's shoulders to within a few yards from me, when they alighted, and walked past me, each shaking hands. The scene became somewhat altered when the King approached. The tumbling and dancing and shuffling and shouting of those who went before him was almost bewildering, and rendered it almost impossible for me to keep my seat, and, fearing to be knocked over, I stood. It became more pleasant as these passed on, and the King's musical bands approached, followed by men carrying golden and silver bells, golden smoking pipes, and other jewels. Then came the King on foot, and surrounded by some fifty attendants. He wore a golden crown on his head, his body and arms were covered with gold ornaments, on each of his fingers were one or two massive gold rings, his sandals were richly decorated with gold, and round his waist was a most magnificent silk cloth. As he drew near he commenced dancing in a most wild and awkward manner,—men taking hold of his legs and holding his body, as if unable by himself to stand,—flung his arms about most curiously, and distorted the features of his countenance by making the most horrid grimaces. Just for one moment he smiled and waved his hand, then taking his sceptre from an attendant, signalled for the procession to move on. When the Queen-mother passed, I took hold of her hand to shake hands; two or three women caught them, and held them. I afterwards asked what this meant, and I was told it was to prevent my fetishes doing her any harm. It was seven o'clock when the reception was over, and I returned to my quarters."", 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

The General History of Africa does not provide specific information about an increase in sacrifices or evidence of spiritual manipulation of the King to maintain harmful traditional practices. Instead, it focuses on Dahomey's economic transition from the slave trade to the palm oil trade under King Gezo, driven by external trading interests rather than internal spiritual dynamics. This absence of information suggests that the textbook does not support the notion of spiritual manipulation or an increase in sacrifices as a political or religious strategy. In contrast, The African Times articles describe the King's adherence to traditional customs involving human sacrifices, such as the ""Attor"" and ""Sorsi"" ceremonies, indicating a continuation or increase in such practices. The articles also highlight the King's susceptibility to superstitious beliefs and spiritual influences, drawing parallels to the King of Madagascar, who was manipulated to maintain heathen customs. While the articles suggest a context that supports the claim of a shift in political or religious dynamics potentially influenced by spiritualism, they lack direct evidence of such manipulation in Dahomey.

What they have found bears little resemblance either to the \'fanatical witch-doctors\' of colonial reports, or to \'the magic of despair\'. They have found, to begin with, that religious teachings and symbols often bore very directly on the question of sovereignty and legitimacy. Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west.

The interrelationship between kingship and fertility underpinned the mys› tification of the ruler and reinforced his position as symbolic owner and spiritual guardian of the land. As a result, he retained the exclusive right to allocate land, which was the basis of control over subordinate chiefs and other subjects and underpinned a cycle of reciprocity. In repayment for the opportunity to use the king's land and benefit from his divine prowess, his subjects were expected to provide specified taxes, labour service and tribute that varied from one kingdom to another. Throughout both state systems, moreover, the largest tusk of a dead elephant automatically belonged to the monarch as owner of the land. In some societies, such as Manica, the Lunda of Kazembe, and Undi, the monarch also maintained a theoretical monopoly over commerce, while in Changamire's kingdom the ruler was the ultimate owner of most cattle.$^{5}$ These tribute, labour and commercial arrangements enhanced the power and wealth of the monarch, who redistributed to his principal lieutenants a portion of the surplus which he extracted, to ensure their continued loyalty.

But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

In order to understand the changes implied by the terms 'caliphate' and 'emirate', let us briefly and very schematically recapitulate the old political system the reformers had replaced.\nThe most notable feature of the old system was the role of the king, known variously as mai, sarki, etsu, alafin. Before the shifts in power in the late eighteenth century, the king had ritual functions and a role that required a certain seclusion from the public; the palace was more sacred than a mere house. The king was more or less above politics, a symbol of great authority in whose name all acts were done; he represented the state. A number of men and women who as slaves or eunuchs were without kin or heirs were servants dedicated to the palace and the king's person; they formed one section of the administration. Another section was formed by large independent households with hereditary claims to titles, the holders of which thus had their own followings of men. A third section was the family of the king, particularly the king's mother or sister, his brothers and sons. The composition of councils and bodies responsible for rituals or for military leadership varied in detail from state to state, often with the palace slaves and the free office-holders divided into orders through which individuals could move by promotion. Political competition was limited to the offices under the king. As far as we know there were in the late eighteenth century trends for kings to take a more active part in politics, to become more exclusively Muslim and to promote reforms on the lines of Islamic government.$^{6}$ Economically, it seems that it was a period of rising levels of consumption (particularly of cotton cloth) and demand for slaves; and there was a need to regulate the expanding market and protect it. The effects of these changes reverberated down to the trading, farming and pastoral communities in the countryside, as those involved in political competition sought to strengthen their hold on their bases of power; as a consequence of which the ¿jihad found widespread support among the victims of these changes."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80', 'content': 'The Muslim reformers (who included at least one of the last, reforming Hausa kings) had a very different blueprint to institute. The role of the king was replaced by an amir neither whose person nor whose palace was sacred. Allah, and not the state personified by the king, was the source of authority. Consequently the amir was chosen not for any inherited quality of sacredness but for his personal piety towards Allah. The amir was the first among equals; his companions as a group were to share power under the amir\'s leadership. As a result, the role of palace slave-officials was to be reduced to that of personal servants and the formal office of queen mother or sister was eliminated. The amir was part of the political process, and his office was theoretically open to any suitably pious candidate. A minimal bureaucracy of ministers, judges, inspectors, police and imams was established as prescribed by the blueprint; and the regulations of the sharTa law, following the Mäliki school of interpretation, were to order relations between persons and between groups. The changes were designed to limit and formalize the political processes, to prevent gross manipulation of previously unwritten rules as well as to curtail the growth of palacecentred government. It was intended to do away with the ambiguity of a Muslim wielding ritual authority based on local, traditional religious belief, and replace it with an authority derived solely from Allah, an authority not only acceptable to the Muslim community but also accountable to it. The blueprint\'s detail is most conveniently set out by \'Abdullah dan Fodio in his book to guide the Kano community on their new constitution, Diyd"" alhukkatn.$^{1}$ But as problems arose, Muhammad Bello and subsequent caliphs wrote letters to the various leaders of nascent communities, outlining the crucial elements of the new system and adding some practical details. From one viewpoint, the political and intellectual. history of the nineteenth century can be seen as an extended exercise in trying to implement or modify the reformers\' blueprint. From another viewpoint (also implied in the blueprint), it is a history of the development and purposeful integration of the rural economies of the region, and their closer linking with first the Mediterranean and later the Atlantic economies.

In the Sudan, as in Egypt and the Ottoman empire generally, ""it was the policy of the rulers to establish a secular state in which Islamic institutions as such would have a minimal role. Consequently the süfí Islam of the Sudan, which already had a profound grip on the rulers and the ruled,56 was bound to suffer severe blows.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed.

We are glad to remark that the British Government have firm opinions as to the policy to be pursued with reference to the King of Dahomey. Some anti-slavery journals appear to deprecate the use of force towards that monarch. They think that persuasion and entreaty should be brought to bear on him, with a view to induce him to desist from his practices of sacrificing human beings and engaging in slave-hunts. Persuasion, argument, and entreaty, have been repeatedly used on this present King of Dahomey and his predecessors, and used in vain. These kings tell us that it is the custom of their nation to hunt for slaves and to sacrifice human beings. He who is king is obliged to do these things. It is with him just as much a duty as the abiding by the advice of responsible ministers is with the Sovereign of Great Britain. If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live. You go about kidnapping and killing people who never harmed you—who don\'t even know you. You prevent commerce, you hinder civilization, you create misery and desolation, you break up hundreds of thousands of happy families. This will not do. The world really can\'t get on in this manner. We have spoken to you, we have reasoned with you, we have entreated you—nay, we have even offered you money to leave off troubling your neighbours. Well, you are obstinate, you are perverse; you won\'t listen to anything; you will continue killing, kidnapping, and plundering, for no other reason than because you like it. Now we are resolved to put an end to your proceedings. You shall keep the peace in future. You shall no longer be a bugbear, a nuisance, a terror and a scourge to all surrounding nations. Kill yourselves if you like—that\'s your business; but if you dare to step out of your own boundaries and disturb other nations who never troubled you, you shall pay for it—yea, in such wise that you shall never have the power to molest the neighbours again.\'\n\n""If England would say this, and do it, she might save millions sterling in money, and she would be the salvation of Africa and millions of her suffering children.""—*West African Herald.*', 'last_edit_date': '1862-02-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_02_1862#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS, AND EX-KING ""DOCEMO.""', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Intriguers to assist him in spending it, and to enable them, under cover of his name, to levy contributions on the mainland natives. They made a sort of Court at his residence, and, there cannot be a shadow of doubt, exercised wrongfully in his name an influence in the neighbouring countries, which was prejudicial to the best interests of the British settlements. We exposed all this in one of our articles a few months ago, showing at the same time how great an obstacle was placed in the way of the spread of Christian civilization in the Fetish worship and practices continued under Docemo\'s patronage and by his support, and stating our conviction that if the interference in the affairs of the interior countries having relation to the settlement of Lagos by the Fetish priests and other intriguers using ex-King Docemo\'s name did not cease, and if the Fetish practices—at least so far as regarded their offensive public exhibition—were not discontinued, it would become the duty of the British Government to remove the ex-King to Sierra Leone, or some other British settlement on the West Coast, where he would be freed from the pernicious influences until that time surrounding him, and be brought more under those of the semblance at least, if not the reality, of Christian civilization. We scarcely need say that in this we had no ill-feeling against King Docemo. Far indeed from this. We should have felt regret had it become necessary for Her Majesty\'s Government to adopt and carry out our suggestion for his removal, because there must necessarily have been some pain inflicted by the disruption of friendly ties and associations inseparable from such a measure; but the existing and spreading evil seemed so great that we could not hesitate a moment in the conviction that, in the absence of all other effective remedy, private interests and feelings must be sacrificed to political and social considerations. Under such circumstances, the letter from Lagos, which will be found in another column, headed ""Ex-King Docemo almost Persuaded,"" has been received by us with a degree of pleasure that we really cannot fully describe. If there be no exaggeration in it (which, from the character of the writer, we believe there is not), and if the happy change therein announced should prove to be a permanent one, there is great reason to congratulate not only King Docemo, but the British authorities and the settlements generally, on its having taken place. To us it wears the aspect of a commencement of realization of the high hopes we entertained, at the period of the annexation and subsequently, of a wide-spread civilizing and christianizing influence to be exercised by Lagos; and if any observations of ours should, as the writer asserts, have been made instrumental in any way in bringing about that change, we are indeed thankful to Him in whose name and for whose glory we especially labour, and who alone can ""give the increase."" The mere relinquishment by the ex-King of his hitherto mental dependence on those vile Fetish priest impostors who for their own individual gain hold vast multitudes in slavish dependence—his withdrawal of his patronage from them, and shutting against them that purse which they have so long plundered to his irreparable loss—is in itself a very important step in the right direction, and cannot fail of a beneficial influence on the native mind. But we hope the change will go further than this, and that the intercourse which had begun with that able African Christian minister, the Rev. James Johnson, will lead to far more important results. Being of those who believe and feel that the time of the end of the present dispensation is near at hand, and that the new one will be ushered in speedily with great and awful changes, our heart burns with desire to see the way of our Lord more widely prepared, and that increasing multitudes should be ready to welcome that Reign of Peace for which all creation groans being burdened. The deep and increasing interest we have ever taken in Lagos and its affairs is well known to all our readers, and the delay in the realization of our expectations of good to result from civilized institutions, and the continuous proclamation of the Gospel there, has weighed heavily upon us. Our hopes now revive, and Lagos attains to new importance in our eyes, since the ex-King bursts the fetters of the degrading superstitions which had hitherto held him captive, and opens his heart and ears to those ""good tidings"" which were proclaimed at Bethlehem.

About the period that the Rev. William West, the superintendent of the Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, was at Coomassie on a visit to the King, in company with the Rev. John Osco Ansah (an Ashantee prince) and Mr. Ghartey, a report was brought to his Majesty that a woman in a neighbouring village had made use of his great oath without sufficient cause. Quaku Duah at once despatched his executioner with his staff to the said village with orders (I need not say *strict or positive orders*, as in Coomassie all orders are positive and irrevocable) to slay every man, woman, child, sheep, goat, dog, fowl, and living creature therein, and to raze the place to the ground, and scatter salt over the ruins. *These orders were executed literally.* For the truth of this I refer to the three gentlemen named above.

When sober, the missionaries received protection from him, and especially since the late war, when the Christians in his army were the means of saving him from his enemies.

As soon as the King was dead, his attendants sought for some of his wives, to dispatch them after him. Some of them took refuge with the missionaries. Three or four were concealed in one house. The missionaries ran great risk in this, but they were not attacked. The natives say that ten or twelve years ago they would have been, but that now they cannot touch the missionaries, knowing what good they do for their country.

The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual ""Royal custom,"" which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life. The chiefs were well pleased with the treatment and comfort they received on the voyage to England, and what they saw in the Liverpool streets and docks caused them great surprise.\n\nThese envoys took 21 days to get from Dahomey to Lagos on account of their adopting a circuitous route in order to avoid the French troops who are now operating in Dahomey.

One was a celebrated slavetrader, now dead; the other an equally well-known native merchant. The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this.

Rulers were legitimized through ritual recognition, and when a ruler and his people determined to defend their sovereignty they naturally drew heavily on religious symbols and ideas. Rodney, in a paper on Ovimbundu resistance in Angola, remarks that \'a great deal of attention has been paid to spiritual resistance in a later stage of the African struggle notably in cases like the Maji Maji wars ... but for ""primary resistances"" there is a tendency to under-emphasize the fact that African peoples every› where automatically resisted not only in material terms but also with their own metaphysical religious weapons.\' 21 In another paper, this time on the resistance of the Gaza state to the Portuguese in southern Mozambique, Rodney writes of the possible traumatic consequences of the commitment of spiritual resources to the struggle. \'The Ngoni of Gaza suffered not only the destruction of their political capital but also the defilement of their principal shrine\'; after military defeat in 1895 the royal ritual objects were lost; diviners threw away their divining bones after the incomprehensible event of defeat; the \'high priestess\' was dismissed and executed. \'Awareness of crisis at a deep spiritual level was quite widespread.\' 22 It was,out of crises of legitimacy of this sort that the great movements which attempted to redefine sovereignty often emerged. Such movements almost invariably had the advantage of spiritual leaders, enunciating the message of wider unity. Sometimes this sort of development took place in the context of Islam - and Islamic ideologies of millennialism and resistance spread right across the Sudanic belt from east to west. Some› times it happened because of the influence of Christian ideas - and Hendrik Wittboi drew upon Protestant Christianity for his doctrine of sovereignty, while an African independent Christian prophet was active among the Nama at the time of their rising against the Germans.

Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

And does not the blood of these poor fellows cry to the Christian English to hasten themselves for the rescue of the weak and innocent from the mighty? As soon as the custom is entirely finished, the lion of the Bights will be up to seek more poor fellows for his cutlass, or for the slavers, to obtain money. I believe Christian England will embrace all chance to make an end of the slave-trade. The King of Dahomey throws all the fault upon those who bring vessels to purchase slaves in his country; he would sell none if no vessel came to purchase. What will Christian England do to stop this trade? Just about a month ago an American schooner left Whydah with upwards of 200 slaves, although the ships of war have been watching the schooner as closely as they possibly could.\n\nTrusting to find you quite well, I am your obedient servant,'}, {'id': 3164, 'article_title': 'The Adventures of S.

As we went out we saw the Dahomians coming towards us, and went to meet them, not knowing that some Dahomians had already placed themselves in ambush. We halted, fired, and then wheeled round, and ran to save our lives. Those in ambush in our rear now came out and fired at us. Some had guns and others matchets and club sticks. I got to within about twenty yards of the gate when one of the Dahomians struck me violently on the back with his club and I fell down on my face to the ground. I was taken up, tied with rope, and taken to the camp; was in the Dahomian camp for about five days, and then sent under Dahomian escort, with about 800 egbas (men and women), that were caught and taken captives about the farms to Abomey; two old soldiers (pensioners) were amongst the lot. We were eleven days on the way from Abeokuta to Abomey, the capital of Dahomey. Several captives who were wounded, including one of the old soldiers, died on the way, and were thrown into the bush like beasts. We were fed with either roast corn or casada, taken from the farms by the Dahomians. We were all tied severally with ropes: at times we ate food once a day, at other times twice. On arrival at Abomey we were all put in chains—by the neck—remained in sitting posture; fed with either agidi, casida, or farina, with ground pepper and salt. We were locked up in a large compound. About fifteen days after our reaching Abomey, the king arrived with his army and some more captives. We were all taken out and brought before responsible chiefs. A fetish priest brought some fetish water in a pot mixed with some ingredient, and gave us each to drink. Those who leant back after drinking one or two glasses of this mixture are put by to be killed; those who sit upright are saved, and destined to be sold into slavery. About 300 leant back and were killed by the king's executioner, at the rate of fifty per day. I saw it all; I was among the saved ones. About a month afterwards I was sold with others to a chief called Wenu, of Arada, a village of about half an hour's journey from Abomey; he bought me for forty bags of cornes, 25f. Although I was born in Liberia and speak and write English, I was very careful not to let them know it, otherwise the king would not have sold me, nor would I afterwards be able to run away. My new master placed me to work in the farm planting yams, corn, casada, etc., and at times sent me in company of other slaves to Whydah to fetch rolls, tobacco, goods, cowries, and rum. When the English Commodore's ship came to Whydah, in February last, to see about some matters, was sent to fetch goods, and I saw some of the officers on shore. I managed to speak to one of the naval officers, recounting my trouble, and he said if I could manage to get on board one of the men-of-war ships, all right; but it was difficult, as the Dahomian authorities at Whydah are very particular with slaves. On the 15th May I was sent again to Whydah, in company of sixty slaves, to fetch goods. We reached Whydah on Wednesday, about 7 o'clock p.m. I told the chief I was going to the yard, where we lodge for the night, and I took occasion to go down the beach unperceived by any one; and by the sea shore I passed all the Custom offices in the different stations; the officials were all asleep. I travelled all night and reached Godomey at 4 o'clock a.m. I went and hid myself in the bush, as it was unsafe for a runaway slave to travel by day. On Thursday evening, at about 7 o'clock, I came out of the bush, and proceeded on my way to Kotonu. I arrived there at midnight. I went in to some of the Cape Palmas Kis-boys, in the employ of Regis Aine's house, and as I could talk the Kiss language, they took me in and hid me in their room. In the afternoon of Friday some canoes arrived from Porto Novo with produce. On returning I succeeded, through the Kissboyso in making arrangement with the Causenien, and I came away with them on Saturday night, and arrived in Porto Novo about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning. I lodged at the house of Senor Bambera. On Monday, the 22nd instant, I saw the steamer Renner in the river, and I went off to the owner on board and told him my trouble. He kindly gave me a free passage to Lagos. We left Porto Novo on Wednesday night, and reached Lagos on Thursday, the 25th instant. Seeing Lagos once more, I thank God for His mercies and safe deliverance. Whilst at Arada the king, who left home with his army in January last, on their usual expedition to Abeokuta and other places, sent home some slaves that he had recently captured from a village. Elated with this he went to Meks; he drove the people into the town; but, mustering efforts, the Meks people drove him out with great loss. About the fines imposed by the Commodore, the king sent to tell the chiefs at home that he will not pay; that he bought nothing from the English Government; but, as for his debt he owed some of the merchants he will pay them; that if the English wanted to fight him, the Commodore must send him notice beforehand, and not take him by surprise. On that account he sent orders and many fetish were made and sacrifices offered to them. A small wooden vessel was made to represent an English ship of war; they bore it fore and aft and, passing chains through it, suspended it, and decorated it with flags, blue, while, and red, put small anchor to it, as well as fetish—the vessel rested on a platform built of mud;—this implied that if the English men-of-war came to fight them the ships would be unable to move, and the Dahomian army will easily get them on the beach, and haul them up on shore. I saw human sacrifices offered to three idols or gods: one is in a house built with human blood and mud, and decorated with the skulls; another built with human blood, mud, and different kinds of beads; and the third built of different pattern of cloth in wooden frame. Before the king left home in January last on his expedition, several hundreds of the captives were killed and offered as sacrifices, several sent to be sold to the westward countries. I saw several slaves for mere trifling things done were tied up and flogged severely, till blood flowed from the body; others are beaten with club-sticks. I was flogged twice, and the marks on my person are evidence. I was nearly dead, and I resolved to escape by the first opportunity. I hope the day will soon come when Dahomey will be taken by England, or at least be made to feel its power.""}, {'id': 4086, 'article_title': 'West Coast News', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast News', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1880#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_12_1880', 'content': 'By the Volta we learn from Whydah that the Chaca, or governor of the place, had died a few weeks before the Volta called there, and that, owing to orders from the King of Dahomey, great excitement prevailed, and trade was almost stopped.

They fired ten important villages and some trading stations, killing all the elderly people, and carrying away all the able-bodied and children. This incursion is ascribed to a religious motive. The Amazons have depopulated the districts bordering on that of Porto Novo to appease the hunger of the evil spirits, who, the priests teach them, feed in some mysterious manner on those sacrificed to them. They have therefore, in their dread of their maleficent divinities, been emboldened to invade a territory which, being under French protection and enjoying an immunity from the sacrificial tax, is thickly populated. Sometimes as many as eight hundred human beings are offered up at Dahomey as a hecatomb. The most robust female children taken prisoners of war are reserved for the Amazonian corps, which now amounts to 4,000. They are entirely consecrated to martial purposes, and obliged under capital penalty to remain vestals.

His first reason is that the surrounding countries may fear him when they hear of it, so as to present themselves to him as his subjects; the second is that the English forbid his best trade, and that is in slaves; he will therefore kill everyone that he catches in war. Some of these poor victims of the Dahomian cutlass have to receive a good flogging, and from a sharp, cutting whip, while their necks are on the blocks ready for the cutlass. The cutting off their heads was not sufficient punishment for the crime of trying to defend themselves or to prevent their being kidnapped and sold for slavery. To say nothing of the number (upwards of 1,500) killed to be the attendants of the late King Gezo in the other world, with bullocks, rams, goats, cocks, drakes, and guinea fowls by the new King, in the great funeral custom of his late father, and who butchered the human beings just in the same way as he did the bullocks &c.—the blood of man and beasts mingled in one hole made on the ground at the gate of the palace—I shall only speak of what is going on now, and that of July and August last. I started from Whydah on the 4th of June, and reached Abomey on the 7th. On my arrival I missed several of the captains, and there were very few men in town. When I made inquiry I learnt that they were gone to attack some place. In about four days the King sent out about 1,600 men for another expedition. On the 15th those who went first returned to Abomey with 600 slaves, men, women, boys and girls, and forty heads of those who made resistance. I was called out to the King's gate to see the train. Each slave is followed by the one who caught him, holding the end of the string. How loud the sight cried for Christian England to help the weak against the mighty! The train comprised several grey-headed men and women. Some of them scarcely could walk. The sick among them were bound in cloth to poles, and carried. Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom. The next day the slaves were delivered to the King; the very old ones were put aside to be killed, the young and the middle-aged were put aside to be sold.\n\nFive days after this the second warriors returned with more than 200 slaves. Being disturbed in the counting, I did not get the correct number after the 200.\n\nThe slaves were brought to the King, as in the first case.

If he abstained from these practices, his subjects would turn him out, and set up another man in his place, who would carry them out in accordance with immemorial usage. In order to put down these barbarous practices, only one course will avail—to use physical force. The British Government must say to the Dahomians, \'Sir, you are unwholesome in your habits and troublesome in your ways and practices. You won\'t live and let live.

Those expectations were formed on the supposition that he might possess some few grains of common sense, which would place vividly before his mental vision the dangers of collision between an earthen pot and a sledge hammer wielded by an arm of power. It seems to be now past dispute that, instead of disowning the acts of the brutal authorities at Whydah, who showed themselves to be fit servants to such a master, he has put a bold front on the matter, and sent the insolent message that ""he will pay the Commodore in powder and bullets if he will come up to Abomey."" This is the language that might be expected only from a doomed idiot, vapouring among the spiritless slaves by whom he may be surrounded, and who have worshipped him as almost a god, until he believes himself to be quite one. It is clearly full time that both King and people should be undeceived by coming in rude contact with something more than a few European trading clerks and agents, who, naturally enough, in the interests of their trade, submit, uncomplainingly, to everything short of actual plunder and brutal violence. Our opinions and feelings respecting the frantic iniquity of Dahomey are so strong, and our conviction that it is the imperative duty of Great Britain, as the real protecting Power on the West Coast of Africa, to put a final end to its enormities as being a daily insult to humanity, is so unalterable, that all we can say in reply to the braggart King is that we hope he will continue in his present frame of mind, and not be moved to feigned repentance by the blockade of his sea-ports. We do not wish him to repent, and thus save himself and his authority from destruction—unless his repentance should go so far (which it never would do) as to secure his faithful acquiescence in British demands, that he should never henceforth make any inroads into Egba territories in search of victims for his atrocious festivals, and that those festivals of blood should be entirely put an end to. The earth has groaned long enough under this blood-thirsty monster, and the devilish system that he at this time represents. That system is incurable by any other means than the entire destruction of the Power with which it is identified, and of which it is an inseparable part. The late King, and the present also, more than once declared to Europeans who have been on missions to Abomey, that even were he desirous of doing so, he could not discontinue that perpetual series of human sacrifices in which his people delight; that his prestige would be gone, and that he in his turn would be a victim if he ceased to justify by deeds his title of ""Man-slayer."" There is possibly truth in this. The people, like their King, are accustomed to sniff the, to them, intoxicating odour of the reeking blood of victims slaughtered before their eyes, and would object to be deprived of a gratification they have so long enjoyed. Under such circumstances there is only one way of purifying the horribly polluted atmosphere of Dahomey, and that is by bringing a superior force to bear upon King, people, and institutions. As already stated, we have ourselves always held the opinion that it was the duty of a civilized Christian Power such as Great Britain to interfere in the interests of humanity. There are now other interests, in addition to those of mere humanity, urging and impelling to the work. Not only has one of her subjects been grievously maltreated, but the financial interests of the Gold Coast Colony are very prejudicially interfered with by the action of Dahomey as a marauding State. The yearly armed expeditions into the Egba territories, even up to the immediate neighbourhood of Abeokuta, in quest of plunder and victims for sacrifice in the ""Customs,"" inflict very great injury not only on the industrious Egba agriculturists, but also, as a necessary result, on the revenues of Lagos. There is an annual scare in the Egba territories. Farms are deserted, the people take refuge in Abeokuta, and their property is wasted and destroyed. We feel sure that we do not exaggerate when we say that were those marauding inroads to cease, and to cease at the absurd certainty that there will not be any renewal of them, agricultural industry will take so great a development in the Egba countries that the production would be doubled, with corresponding advantage to the', 'last_edit_date': '1876-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1876#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Terrible Story from the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In other parts of the town further human sacrifices were taking place.

Their heads were, of course, hanging downwards. The men were there left to die. The traders, as they proceeded along, were unwilling witnesses of a frightful sacrificial execution. They saw a number of natives in a group, and went to the spot to see what was taking place. To their horror they saw a native tied by the feet and neck. The rope to the neck was thrown over a tree in one direction, and the rope attached to the feet was tied to a tree in the opposite direction. The ropes were then drawn tightly, and when the body was distended to its utmost length, another native with a hatchet struck the neck, and severed the head from the body.

We were fully aware of this; but, at the same time, it had never entered our mind that in these latter days of the nineteenth century, we should read, in any portion of the English press, an extenuation, or almost justification, of those horrible customs of Dahomey and Ashanti, some details of which have, ere now, roused the indignation and pity of the people of this country. But the Illustrated News has thus offended. In its number of Sept. 6, à propos of the dancers of Dahomey, it asserts that those horrible massacres, those human sacrifices in the customs of Dahomey, ""are neither more nor less than the solemn execution of a number of criminals and prisoners of war who have been legally condemned to death, and whose decapitation is superintended by the monarch with more formal ceremony than is used by the civilized Governments of Europe."" Could Satan himself have surpassed this? We have so often published details of those sickening atrocities constantly perpetrated in Dahomey and Ashanti, that our readers cannot need them as a spur to indignation against so fiendish a defence of demoniac cruelty. ""Prisoners of war, who have been legally condemned to death!"" We feel a deep and burning shame as we read such words from, we suppose, an English pen. We have long looked on the continued existence of Ashanti and Dahomey in power, for the perpetration of their hideous crimes against humanity, as a reproach to Great Britain. A dozen years ago, when publishing details of customs at Ahomey, and of the devastations committed in wars entered upon with the sole object of plunder, and to obtain human victims for the slave ships, and the ""feasts of blood,"" in which both monarch and people delight, we urged upon the Government and people of England the duty of interfering for the prevention of those annual slaughters of tens of thousands of human beings.

This Kucku Mainsah and his wife had been long residents in this district, and he had pawned himself and wife to an Akim man who also had been trading here. This Kucku Mainsah could not be got to fight against his own people; he was employed by his master in trading between this and the coast, and finding the quarrel was over-ruled a little on the coast by the British influence over the acknowledged people in the Protectorate, so that a communication was opened between Eemina and Cape Coast, he ran away to Chimah, and made way to the place where he left his wife, to steal her away.

Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""No less revolutionary and lasting in its impact was the other con› temporaneous religious revolution that was taking place elsewhere in Africa, namely, the Christian missionary revolution. Though attempts at the planting of Christianity in the areas to the south of the Western Sudan reach as far back as the era of the Portuguese explorations in the fifteenth century, there was hardly any trace of the Christian religion left by the turn of the eighteenth century. However, from about the last decade of that century and especially during the first five decades of the nineteenth century, the situation underwent a revolutionary change. Primarily because of the evangelical revival in Europe associated with John Wesley, and the anti-slavery and humanitarian spirit of the age, born out of radical philosophies typified by the American and French revolutions, the attempt to plant and spread Christianity assumed the same dynamic if not militant form that characterized Islamic expansion in the Western Sudan. Here, initially, instead of the Ku'ran and the Sword, the Bible, the plough and commerce were the means resorted to, and the active agents were not djikâd leaders, clerics and their flag-bearers but a host of missionary societies, formed and based in Europe and America, and their African agents in Africa. Thus, whereas by 1800 there were only three missionary societies operating in the whole of West Africa, namely, the Society for the Propa› gation of the Gospel (SPG), the Wesleyan Missionary Society (WMS) and the Glasgow and Scottish Missionary Society, by 1840 only four decades later, there were more than fifteen such societies at work.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group. Unity on a new basis was possible only in a milieu which marked a departure from the old forms of unity and saw no way of returning to them. The new converts were in just such a milieu. These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete. No wonder anti-colonial protest was accompanied by disenchantment with those who had brought the new faith to them, a disenchantment with the Europeans as genuine Christians and with racial discrimination in the established churches.

As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end.

For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples.

Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

Of particular relevance as we have seen already in some of the earlier chapters were the messianic movements which expressed indigenous ideologies as well as those which reflected Islamic and Christian ones. They were movements which were emancipatory in character, expressing what is essentially a universal phenomenon in situations in which communities had to express their dissatisfaction with their living conditions and a desire for regeneration. They represented an ideology competing against colonial› ism in so far as the latter represented a negation of indigenous culture and economic, social and psychological depression of the colonized. In the words of Lanternari, 'They reflect the anxieties and hopes of the groups that participate in them for a sudden and total transformation of their physical, social and psychological environment.' 16 Prominent examples of such movements in our period, some of whose activities have been discussed in Chapter 20 above, were Ethiopianism in South and East Africa, and the movement spearheaded by millenarian preachers in Southern and Central Africa, notably the Kitawala (African and Congo Watch Tower) with large following in the Rhodesias, spreading to the Congo (now Zaire) and Nyasaland (now Malawi); the Kimbanguist movement (founded in the Belgian Congo by Simon Kimbangu) with following in Belgian and French Congo and the neo-Kimbanguist Mission des Noirs founded in the Lower Congo by Simon-Pierre Mpadi. Otherwise known as the Khakists, the movement had influence among the population of French Congo and Oubangui-Chari (now Central African Republic). Some of these movements were inspired by their acceptance of Christianity but were disenchanted with the expression of the religion in the organized Church of the colonial societies. African nationalists who were anxious to preserve Africans against colonial oppression found the Church at best indifferent. They therefore broke away very much in the spirit of the Reformation which has been characteristic of the growth and spread of Christianity in many societies. Like the reformation movements in Europe and elsewhere, the churches and movements founded by African National› ists aimed at applying Christian ideologies like the ideas of the brotherhood of man and the essential oneness of believers, without distinction as to race or colour, to end discrimination and oppression."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Religious protest movements', 'content': ""One of the weapons that East Africans used from early on in their struggle against colonialism was religion. Resistance called for mobilization, and in many regions religious leadership arose to fulfil this role. The era of primary resistance was also the era of the prophets. While the Africans lost the actual wars in the battlefield, the mood of resistance remained entrenched in the hearts of the many. The followers of the Orkoiyot in Nandi remained active and watchful and the Nandi were repeatedly mobilized by this prophetic leadership to resist the abuses of colonialism over the years.$^{4}$ Similarly colonial archives from Kenya are full of references to witch doctors and laibons creating trouble in Marakwet, Kericho and Samburu.

The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious.

On the 29th ult., Egbo runners, or masked men, perambulated the town, flogging and fining every one that they could catch. The subjects of this injustice did nothing, but the tyrants deem it necessary to maintain their own power to flog and fine innocent slaves. On the 3rd inst., the masked men went out, scattered the market, and seized much goods belonging to the poor people, which they took away. The tyrants in town, Orok and the three Archibong, got a missionary to their own liking to hold a meeting once a week in their yard. The first good result of this meeting was the issuing of a proclamation that all the dogs in town must be killed, because they spoil Orok\'s ju-ju. As our brave missionary said in church on the following Sabbath, ""The poor ignorant heathens in town sacrificed many dogs last week to devils."" The tyrants do not like Mr. Ross; they hate him as much as Ahab did Micaiah. After the meeting was over in Orok\'s yard, and the missionary away, he at once sacrificed fowls to his ju-ju. Archibong Ezo, son of Archibong II., not long ago flogged a woman to death. Archibong Adam, son of late Archibong III., flogged a boy most barbarously, and when the poor fellow was gasping most piteously, he threw him into the mangrove swamp, to be devoured by crocodiles. There is a respectable young man in town, of some property; the three Archibong boys, including the two murderers, put him in chains, and demanded all his people and property. The plea set up for this iniquitous demand was, that Okom Ma traded seventeen years for Archibong II., and six years for Archibong III., for which he never received any wages. This is a strange reward. The judges met to consider the matter, and allowed the boys to have the palaver all their own way. Okom Ma has appealed to Consul Hewett. Up to this time I have not heard that Consul Hewett settled a single palaver on the West Coast, except one in Old Calabar, where he took the part of a European against the natives. I know he does not strike awe into the natives, and command respect, as his predecessor did.

The tyrants dread the day of the termination of their bloodshed, oppression, and robbery. British protection would justly deprive the Calabarees of their monopoly of direct trade with the surrounding tribes, which are ten times more numerous than they; would open up the inland country to the benefits of commerce and civilization, and would, undoubtedly, develop trade, as security to life and property always does.—I am, &c.,'}]","[{'document_title': 'CAMEROONS—AFRICAN CRUELTY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Nothing can better illustrate the savagery and barbarism among which our brethren labour in Africa than the following narrative. Scenes of cruelty are less common now than formerly in the neighbourhood of the missionary stations. Nothing but the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit can change the blood-thirsty natives into children of peace and love: ""Every now and again, some of these heathen people show their thirst for blood by committing some horrible deed of wickedness. A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also. Frequently these palavers occupy much of our time, but it is not time lost; for it increases our influence for good amongst them, and often saves greater evils and the depression and stoppage of trade, both among themselves and between them and the European merchants.""', 'last_edit_date': '1871-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""?

We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them?

But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1).

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era > Indigenous Christianity', 'content': ""Besides these churches, another set arose which were not the product of anxiety alleviation or stress in society but rather derived their inspiration from a more positive ideology.

In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious.

It was a pervasive force, and as Emmanuel Obiechina aptly puts it: There is hardly any important area of human experience which is not linked to the supernatural and the people's sense of religion and religious piety ... these ... are part and parcel of the ideological structure of traditional society, and so essential to a proper interpreta› tion of experience in the traditional social context. 1\nThis pervasiveness of religion through the total way of life of African peoples gave traditional religion a remarkable wholeness within the context of the culture out of which it originated.\nIt was based on a particular world view, which included not only the people's view of the supernatural but also their understanding of the nature of the universe, the nature of human beings and their place in the world, and the nature of God, who was known by various local names. Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.\nThere was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death. The divinities had their cults, priests and shrines and there were some among them which were associated with various features of the environment: but these palpable objects were the abodes of the gods and not the gods themselves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Traditional African religion in the pre-colonial period', 'content': ""In addition to these supernatural entities, there were other spirits or mystical powers which were recognized and reckoned with for their ability to aid or harm human beings.

Finally, there were charms, amulets and talismans which were used for protective as well as offensive purposes.\nThe general conception of man was that he was a compound of immaterial and material substance. The immaterial part of man (the soul) survived him after death, while the material part (the body) disintegrated after death. Death therefore did not end life; it was an extension of life. The dead remained members of society and there was believed to be a community of the dead alongside the community of the living, and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two communities. Human society was an unbroken family made up of the dead, the living and the yet unborn.\nWith regard to man's relation to society, being human meant belonging to a community and that involved participating in the beliefs, ceremonies, rituals and festivals ofthat community$^{2}$ and membership of the community was emphasized more than a member's individuality. For society was based more on obligation than on individual rights and an individual assumed his rights in the exercise of his obligations, which made society a chain of interrelationships. Furthermore, human life was viewed and understood as a cycle of birth, puberty, marriage and procreation, death and the afterlife. An individual did not stay in one stage of existence for ever; he necessarily moved on to the next, and in order to make the transition smooth, special rites were performed to ensure that no breaks occurred, and movement and regeneration continued perpetually. 3\nAfrican traditional religion was not only pervasive, it also bound men to the unseen powers and helped them to form correct relations with the non-human powers; it also bound men to their fellow human beings.\nReligion acted as the cement which held societies together, providing them with support and stability.

The town of Ibara is situated on a hill enclosed by a wood, bearing near due west from Abeokuta, about seven miles distant. Being thus enclosed, the town cannot be seen from Abeokuta, but the wood is a conspicuous object. The people had previously fled to Abeokuta and other places for protection; the Dahomans met there nothing but an empty town. On the 8th several small parties went out to observe the enemy. One or two of these approached too near, and were made prisoners. A speedy attack was anticipated, and every preparation made. An easterly wind blew for two or three days, which thickened the atmosphere so that distant objects were obscured. On the evening of Monday rapid firing was heard, which was supposed to be an attack. Those sleeping at home rushed to their posts, but found it to be a mistake. On the following night a general discharge of muskets took place throughout the Egba lines by arrangement, in order to prove their efficiency, and as a demonstration to the enemy. The effect was singular as seen from a hill commanding a view of the walls occupied by the people, extending over several miles. It produced a considerable effect on the enemy, we are told, and was heard in the farms near Lagos; at Otta it was supposed Abeokuta had been taken. A fall of rain cleared the atmosphere, and distant objects became again visible. The Dahomans were observed to have encamped around the Ibara wood, having it in their rear, and in their front were several small patches of trees and underwood, which afforded them partial cover. They appeared to occupy extended lines, with but little depth, and to be divided into divisions of some sort, with well marked spaces between. Their main strength appeared to be on their right, which occupied the highest ground, on the south side of Ibara wood. On Friday a party of young men went out to observe the enemy, and were driven back. On Sunday, the 15th, two persons on horseback, one of them of rank, went to observe the enemy: they went too near, and were surrounded and fired on by parties in ambush. They escaped by the strength of their horses, through God's good providence. One of the horses was so severely wounded, that he died on the road returning, and his rider received several wounds. We observed on Wednesday evening, the 19th, a large fire in the direction of the Dahomey camp; it is supposed to have been caused by their burning the town of Ibara. The following morning the Dahoman camp appeared as usual. In the course of the forenoon smoke was seen to ascend from a place on the north of Ibara, and more distant, supposed to be some other village destroyed by them. In the evening a report prevailed that the Dahomans had destroyed three or four small towns, and caught many persons in them. It is strange that small towns should remain occupied, with so formidable an enemy near. Since writing the above a person who fled with his family has been spoken with. He states that he belongs to Ibara. On the approach of the Dahomans he fled to Kesson. That on the morning of the 19th the Dahomans came and attacked Kesson, but he fled with his family as soon as he heard the report of their muskets. On the 20th, a fresh party were seen in the Dahomey camp, in the rear of their lines; they were supposed to be captives, others supposed them to be holding a public meeting. Some of the Ibara people, going off, it was supposed, to Iberekodo, were attacked by a party of Egbas and Ijayes on the look out; on their return with those whom they caught, the chiefs seized as many as they could, to set them at liberty, and commanded all the rest to be delivered up. A considerable stir was observed in one part of the Dahomey camp on the morning of the 21st. A party of Egbas were seen going out to observe them, with the belief that the Dahomans had left, because they had destroyed some towns and made a few captives. Of this party it is reported that fifteen, at least, were caught in an ambush, and the rest returned with shame. Many young men among the Egbas and the Ijayes have been thus caught; unwilling to believe their elders, proud and selfwilled, they have had to pay dear for a little experience. As the new moon appeared the Mohammedans fired their muskets at the close of their fast, and on Sunday they went out to perform their usual ceremonies, accompanied by firing. Early on Sunday morning a heavy rain fell, lasting for a considerable time; after it had ceased the atmosphere became very clear; a great stir was observed in the Dahomey camp, a great moving about, fires were generally lit, as shown by the smoke. To-day, the 23rd inst., the camp was hidden by a heavy mist until after nine o'clock; on its clearing away objects became visible. The camp appeared as usual, but no one could be seen moving about; after some time a fire was observed to burn beyond the Ibara wood. When near twelve o'clock a fire was seen in the Dahomey camp. At the same time a large number of persons were observed moving about, and one on horseback dressed in white. It soon became apparent to us that the Dahomans had deserted their camp, that the Egbas had taken possession of it, and were burning it down. We were soon after informed that some one had escaped in the night and brought information to the Egbas that the Dahomans were on their homeward march. It is a subject of great gratification and thankfulness to God that this great invasion has thus terminated. The Dahomans saw Abeokuta, and feared to attack it. The prayers of God's people for this place have prevailed; those who thirsted for our blood have been influenced by a higher power than man's. To God be all the praise.""}, {'id': 1934, 'article_title': 'GOD WILL PROVIDE', 'full_section_title': 'GOD WILL PROVIDE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_11_1870', 'content': 'one with assured blessings, the other not with impunity; that those who thus accept and reciprocate his eternal and unchanging love become objects of his especial love and care; that, further, he will interfere in a particular manner for specific and special purposes and ends connected with their present and their eternal happiness, controlling and directing secondary causes, operating even on the hearts and affections, and thrusting his hand among the works of other men, to make them agents for good (and this often when evilly working out an evil personal intent) to those objects of his especial love and care; that to them he assures, while they remain true and faithful and obedient to him in love, that his faithfulness and truth shall never fail; that they shall never seek in vain his supporting power; that he will be ever with them, in answer to prayer, to protect and preserve them; that nothing can or shall happen to them without his direct appointment or permission; and that the result, though the means may be painful and the purpose inscrutable, will be invariably blessing—in the language of the great Apostle, ""That all things shall work together for good to them that love God, and that are the called according to his purpose;"" that when they err, though he may punish—and he will punish their iniquities with stripes—he will not take his loving mercy from them; that in the firm assurance of his watchful care, his unlimited power, and his unceasing love, they may be calm in confidence, and are in duty bound to be so, where the hearts of other men would fail and care overwhelm them, or they would have recourse to expedients that may increase their trouble and their sorrow; that in proportion to their steadfast faith in him and in his promises will be his effectual interposition on their behalf; that while they are bound to employ and use all means that do not involve disobedience to his laws and precepts and revealed will, or distrust in him, he is equally engaged to further their views at the time and in the way that his unerring wisdom determines to be best for them; that his aid shall never be wanting, and that the end shall be peace and joy.\n\nIt is thus that, in seasons of difficulty and danger, those who are partakers of this precious faith in God through Christ, to whom has been committed all things in heaven and in earth, realise the fact of the overruling providence and constant presence of God with them. *God will provide* is not then a mere phrase, but the expression of a living and operating conviction.

""These idlers,"" says St. Augustine, ""living by the sweat of the people, went into the streets and market-places, and drew from those whom they met enough to support a dishonourable existence.""⁵ Apuleius describes these religious mendicants in the eighth book of his Metamorphosis.

We need to be reminded that these persons were pagans to enable us to believe them capable of such things; indeed, even to themselves these abuses appeared so scandalous, that the magistrates attempted to restrain them by positive laws; for, as Cicero tells us, ""these customs filled the people with superstition, and ruined many families."" Minucius Felix relates that, in an affectation of sanctity and a desire to attract the popular gaze, these persons walked about bare-footed, and wore a peculiar kind of dress; that some enjoined on themselves a continual silence;⁶ that others took a vow of poverty;⁷ and it must be confessed—to their honour, pagans as they were—that they really kept their vow; at least, this may be said of some of them, for all belonging to those companies could not be deemed sincere.

So far as we ourselves are personally concerned, we do not for a moment hesitate to say that in all our efforts, the spread of the Redeemer's kingdom upon earth is the great object for which we labour, and that we regard the commercial adjuncts only as secondary, though, in our opinion, indispensable to the rapid progress of Gospel truth among the debased populations of Africa."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'that has deepened and intensified the horrors of an enormity, barbarism, and bloody superstition which so pre-eminently characterise Africa?\n\nWithout at present particularising our efforts in other parts of Africa, let us instance those we have been and are making for obtaining roads on the Gold Coast, and especially from the seacoast to the Ashantee frontier. Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success. The creation and maintenance of good roads, where such facilities for intercommunication have hitherto been unknown, would be a great and useful exhibition of the power of Christian civilization. They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations. And every stage of that amelioration would be a material argument that all could appreciate in favour of that Christianity which the missionary would be engaged in teaching. Such palpable evidences that Christianity has the ""promise of the life that now is"" will dispose them the more readily to believe that it has also indeed and in truth ""the promise of that which is to come.""

Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating.

I have never heard of any people on the West Coast settlements, boasting as we do of civilization, and having the advantages of becoming a more Christian and enlightened people, in whom the natural propensity to worldly pleasures and enjoyments is so powerfully predominant.

In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As to the elevating effects of Islam, hear the evidence of Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, who writes, he says, ""as one having the interests of Christianity deeply at heart.""

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African."" He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man.""

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results. The spectacle of the earnestness, poverty, and simplicity of the Moslem missionaries has a powerful effect on the minds of the negroes, while the greed and the evil lives of Europeans go far to neutralize any good results that may accrue from the teaching of Christianity. Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual."" And Mr. Thomson\'s evidence is to much the same effect.\n\nSouth of the Equator the Arabs are Mohammedans only in name, and there the slave trade is a fatal obstacle to all improvement. Indeed, it would seem that Islam fails to exert that power over any of the races of the great Bantu family which it exercises over the true negroes of the Soudan. Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity.

Mr. Blyden dwells particularly upon the superiority in manliness, self-reliance, and general moral tone of Mahomedan negroes over those of their race who have embraced Christianity.

Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

Ntsikana was a creative religious genius of the same order as Makana; the debates between them on the nature of divinity had very immediate practical consequences and divided the Xhosa into factions, but they were conducted in profound theological terms. And in fact Ntsikana was not primarily concerned with the problems of relationships to the whites, his intention was rather to bring about changes in Xhosa society by means of accepting some of the dynamics of Christian thought, while at the same time repudiating many of the cultural assumptions of the whites. As O. P. Raum tells us, among many Xhosa today 'the beginning of Christianity is not credited to the missionaries but rather to a Christian forerunner in the person of Ntsikana'. 31 Though no other case presents us with so dramatic and direct a prophetic clash as the debate between Makana and Ntsikana, the same range of prophetic possibilities comes out clearly even in areas of very determined resistance, like the areas in which Majï Majï took place, or the Shona areas of Rhodesia.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious.

But though there is no doubt that a land where every man is free is in a better state than where slavery exists to a large extent, yet we must remember that slavery is recognised throughout the Bible, not only in the patriarchal times and under the Mosaic law, but also very distinctly by St. Paul, who lays down the relative duties of masters and servants to the churches of Ephesus and Colosse, and exhorts Timothy to teach the slaves at Ephesus to count their own masters worthy of all honour, especially if their masters were Christians (1 Tim. vi. 1, 2), and sent back to his master, Philemon, Onesimus, who had been converted under his ministry at Rome. St. Paul had fully acknowledged the right of Philemon to his servant, though he thought it convenient for him, as a Christian, to release him, and he insists upon the duty of Christian servants to obey their masters, though he wished them to obtain their freedom if they could (1 Cor. vii. 21). The tendency of Christianity is no doubt to diminish slavery, but it does not do this by exciting the slaves to revolt or run away; on the contrary, it commands them to please their masters well in all things, but it exhorts masters, as it does all other Christians, to do to others as they would they should do to them.""\n\nCotton, with the extremely wet weather, remains scarce, and is readily bought at fourteen strings twenty cowries.\n\nOils exceedingly scarce, with an upward tendency.'}, {'id': 1924, 'article_title': 'Infamous Africans Deserving Severe Punishment', 'full_section_title': 'Infamous Africans Deserving Severe Punishment', 'last_edit_date': '10-06-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_11_1870', 'content': 'Sir,—Daniel Josiah, formerly a washerman, at present a balance-broker, and Charles Allen, a well-known fisherman, of Wilberforce, Sierra Leone, somehow become a native of Lagos.

I caught him in the height of beating a slave-girl, about eight years old, with a skin,* most mercilessly. Charles Allen, who came from the streetdoor, snatched the skin from Daniel Josiah, and began doubling the blows on the poor girl. Some one said that they would kill the girl. Charles Allen replied, ""She can die if she likes."" By this time the poor girl was gasping for breath. Daniel Josiah said, ""Let her die—she\'s my money!"" A native man, who witnessed the scene, could bear the sight no longer; he rushed forward, and, with much difficulty, forced the skin from their hands.

And this has been at once effectual. The Sultan, we are informed by telegram, has signed the Treaty, and the slave market was closed the same day. So far, good. A change had taken place at Zanzibar since the Sultan proved so intractable with Sir Bartle Frere. It will be remembered that the influence of the French Consular authorities had been employed to strengthen the Sultan in his ideas of resistance. Through their sinister efforts, France and the Sultan of Zanzibar were held up to the world as conjoint in the East African slave trade iniquity. This was too much. M. Thiers, then President of the French Republic, ordered an immediate change, and that French influence should be used the other way. M. Thiers would have joined England in coercion, if necessary; but the mere threat has been enough. The Sultan saw his game was played out—or the Arab slave traders did, which is the same thing—and the Sultan has accepted the Treaty. We presume this Treaty provides for the entire abolition of all slave importation from the mainland to Zanzibar. Nothing short of this will suffice. If the slaves already at Zanzibar be properly treated, their natural increase will supply all reasonable wants of the Sultan, and Zanzibar cultivation. Not one more African should be allowed to be brought to Zanzibar, and then, with due naval vigilance, the Arab slave trade on the East Coast will be at an end. But this is not all that was required as regards the East African slave hunts, and export slave trade. There are still the slave hunts to supply the trade carried on from the Portuguese territory, so called,—on which we remarked in our last, when reviewing Captain Sulivan\'s admirable work. We cannot allow the delegates of a Christian Power to carry on a trade which we have forcibly compelled the Sultan of Zanzibar to put an end to on that part of the coast where he has dominion. Let us rejoice over what has been done, but not relax our efforts until all shall have been accomplished.

Orok can never walk the Mbiam streets for fear of being struck down dead. Archibong Edem promises to continue a barbarous, oppressive heathen.

The poor oppressed slaves long for the day of liberation, which, it is to be hoped, is not far distant. A heathen of the Archibong type, because one of his people would not go to the old mission church, but to Mr. Ross\'s, compelled him to carry thirteen cannon balls, one piece of flint, and two guns, through the town for half a day in drenching rain.

We do not hear anything about electing a king by the chiefs, who are still divided amongst themselves as to the individual on whom they should confer this honour. It is well known that Orok still thirsts for the honour, although he has been made a fool by the European traders, when, two years ago, they induced a rum-seller\'s clerk, the then Acting Consul, to put a tinselled hat on his head for a crown, and, to complete the farce, invited a missionary to bless him, who shortly before implored heaven not to make him king. Orok since that time is inwardly angry with Makara for having made a fool of him, and is not so ready to take their advice. Knowing, as I do, what kind of advice white men and some missionaries give Orok, and what example they set before him, I wonder he is not worse.

It was on the 1st of August, 1834, that an Act of the British Parliament came into force by which the abolition of the last vestiges of slavery in British dominions was effected. To Englishmen of the present generation it seems impossible that slavery, which had been for centuries illegal in Great Britain, should be not only tolerated, but absolutely supported—and in its very worst and vilest form—by the same laws which made all in England free. Those who never knew what the Western slave-trade was cannot even conceive its horrors. And yet men like Clarkson and Wilberforce had to toil year after year, and session after session, to make their own countrymen see that such a state of society was opposed to the spirit of Christianity, and that, with such an incubus, the true material progress of a nation was impossible. The present century was some years old before the terrible evils of the foreign slave-trade were put down by force; and slavery, as a ""domestic institution,"" was allowed to linger on for three and twenty years later. It is a matter of history that even then the Parliament of Great Britain was called upon to pay £20,000,000 compensation for the loss of service to the slave-owners—though surely that was a tax that was paid willingly enough, and would be paid over again quite as readily if needed. The great outcry of the slave-owners was, at the time of the abolition, that they and the land would be ruined—that those who had only worked because they were compelled would, when compulsion was no longer used, give themselves up to rioting and idleness. There was no doubt much truth in this; the negroes had been for generations treated at the best as naughty children, and it was only fair and reasonable to expect that when once the whip which had so long been held over their backs was removed, they would behave as such. But the fact, we are glad to say, was far otherwise. As a general rule, the negroes were, by the gift of their freedom, urged on to higher things. That which had been necessarily in many cases mere ""eye-service,"" became true and loyal labour, by which the employer was to gain and does gain far more than the owner could hope to look for. And there is one other effect of the great abolition which must not be lost sight of. In how many cases has it enabled Africans to return to the country from which, perhaps, they had been torn away in their childhood, but to which, all through their hard trial, their hearts had turned; and to go back, not empty-handed to the land of their birth, but with them bring the treasures of education, civilization, and Christianity, and by this means to help on the coming of the still greater Day of Emancipation when all her sons shall be free from the dark cloud of ignorance and oppression, and the Dark Continent shall once more take her foremost place in wielding the destinies of the world.'}, {'id': 4894, 'article_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE-TRADE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_08_1884', 'content': 'In looking through the lamentable history of those times, it is impossible to prevent a feeling of nausea and disgust. We need only refer to one pamphlet, published in 1833, under the title, ""Three Months in Jamaica in 1832."" This little publication had an enormous sale, and did much to rouse the British nation to a sense of the enormities daily committed in her distant colonies. The author went out to Jamaica with the intention of residing in a business capacity on a sugar plantation. He was one of those who did not believe in the horrors of slavery, and thought that our factory children in England were worse off than any plantation slaves. He was soon undeceived. Proceeding on horseback to the estate soon after his arrival, and enjoying the exquisite tropical scenery, he came upon a gang of negroes at work, most of them females. As he rode past the driver cracked his tremendous whip, shouting out, ""Work! work!"" and from that moment the enchanting scenery and the beautiful humming-birds of Jamaica had no longer any charm for him. The first evening of his arrival at the plantation the overseer gave the command, ""Blow shell!"" A large shell was blown, and four athletic negro drivers appeared, bringing in six slaves. For some slight defect in the tally of the day\'s work these men had to be flogged. The flogging of the men is described in terms too painful to repeat; but worst of all is the account given of similar punishments inflicted upon women, some of them quite young girls. The author took pains to inquire whether this treatment was general, and he came to the conclusion that it was next to impossible to find a slave, either male or female, who had not been flogged. But this was only one and the most ordinary form of punishment; the stocks and contrivances for hanging negroes by their thumbs, wrists, etc., were only too common, whilst hundreds were killed outright. This picture is too revolting to contemplate at the present day, and to us now it appears almost incredible.\n\nIt is refreshing to record the feelings of joy and gratitude with which Mr. Buxton and his friends received the accounts of ""the admirable conduct of the negroes on the great day of freedom."" Mr. Buxton says: ""Throughout the colonies the churches and chapels had been thrown open, and the slaves had crowded into them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the solemn moment, all hushed in silent prayer. When twelve o\'clock sounded they sprang upon their feet, and through every island rang the glad sound of thanksgiving to the Father of All, for the chains were broken, and the slaves were free.""'}]","[{'document_title': 'Great Demonstration in Honour of Mr. Chamerovzow, the Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The right rev.

Mr. Ezzidio, and although I am only a passer-by, yet I feel it my duty to show that I have an interest as great as any citizen of this colony. The Anti-Slavery Society has done wonders, more than any other society of a like kind. Slavery we all know to be a gigantic evil in Africa, and has done a great deal of mischief for centuries. It was carried on by Europe for a long time, but when they saw its evils, and some of the champions stood up, such as Brougham, Buxton, Wilberforce, Clarkson, and others, it was abolished. Wilberforce, you will all remember, stood up as the champion in the battle-field, and though he had few to support and go with him, yet, after many years of toil, he destroyed the gigantic evil in the West Indies and the various other British Colonies, at a cost to the public of 20,000,000£. Another great achievement was the abolition of the slave-trade from the West Coast of Africa. The Anti-Slavery Society is now nominally abolished, its labour has been accomplished, and it has only now to keep a watch over us. The Wilberforce memorial ought to have been erected by us as a testimonial to that great champion, but we have allowed it to rest in other hands, and up to this time we find that testimonial still unfinished. It is a very laudable object to have something in memory of that society which has done so much good for us. (Hear.) If I own this coat on my back to-day, it is through this society. (Hear.) If I wear a pair of shoes, it is by this society. (Cheers.) This is just the time for us to lend our aid to this society, seeing to what an elevation we have been brought through the agency of this society. We ourselves ought to have organised an anti-slavery society in this very city, in order that its members might go into the interior and tell those tribes what great benefits we have derived from our European brethren, and tell them to open their country to Christian civilisation. If we do not do this, then we have not done our duty as a liberated nation. Years back, before I was liberated from the slave ship, I heard that the English nation were robbers, they said that the British were not able to work for themselves and therefore robbed the Portuguese and Spaniards, so that when the ship in which I was was captured, I lamented and hid myself from one part of the ship to the other, to avoid being put in the man-of-war.

If the Society means to work successfully in the interior, they must be blind to the entire abolition of domestic slavery among the Christians; they can only enforce laws in all the churches, to be observed by the members. 1st. That no slave bought by Christians should be again sold into slavery, and that they should try all their best endeavours to see their slaves become converted Christians. 2nd. That the converted slaves be so secure that their heathen relations have no power to claim them after their death. 3rd. That Christian slaves should serve their masters for the period of seven years, and then be set at liberty. Members who cannot conform to these laws should be considered as nominal members, and not full members of the Church of God on earth; but at the same time the native agents must be entirely free from the blot. Entire abolition of domestic slavery among Christians cannot be successfully worked under heathen government; it can do very well under British jurisdiction, and where the Government takes the active part in suppressing the same. The ultimatum in the Church Missionary Society\'s Slave Circular, in the event of any of their native (Egba) agents refusing to give up their slaves, still remains to be carried into effect; the so-called ministers (?) of the Gospel must be made to surrender their cloth, or faithfully ""publish freedom to the slave.""

We have never forgotten that it was alleged the great opposition at Lagos against the annexation of that place to the British Crown, was promoted by educated native British subjects, who could no longer be slaveholders there under British rule. But we hoped the influence of British Lagos would so prevail, and the fear of British Lagos be so felt, that in Abeokuta as well as in Lagos, no British subject, or so-called Christian, would lay himself open to legal pains and penalties and the condemnation of good men, by buying, holding, or selling his fellow-creatures as slaves. But the deposition and letter alluded to disabuse us on this head. The evil leaven seems to be there in power. Its presence is disgraceful to those educated Africans who are leavened by it. This Robbio, this so-called Christian slaveholder of Abeokuta—this seemingly pitiless master of a Christian slave—whose tender mercies to his slave seem to have been, indeed, as cruel as those of any pagan slaveholder could have been, was, we believe, some two or three years in Manchester, educating there as a mechanic and engineer. We do not recollect whether he had been a slave liberated at Sierra Leone, or was sent direct from Abeokuta for instruction. We believe, however, that he is a British subject, and if so, and that deposition be a true statement of facts, we hope that should he come within the reach of British power, he will be made an example of. It seems to us, moreover, quite clear that the indulgence to slaveholders at Lagos, of which we have so often complained, should now cease, and the recommendation of the Committee of the House of Commons be carried out by an immediate abolition of all slavery within the precincts of the colony. We hope, too, that we shall never again hear of a slave who has sought refuge there being delivered up to her former master in a heathen town, even though he be a king, and demand her on the ground of her being one of his wives, or intended wives, and promise that she shall not be punished—a promise, the value of which in such cases is less than that of a grain of common sand. And a proclamation should also issue that native or other British subjects in Abeokuta, or elsewhere in Africa (as in all other parts of the world), against whom proof may be obtained that they are holders, or buyers, or sellers of slaves will be severely punished. We recommend, moreover, to missionaries of all Christian churches to follow from henceforth the course so successfully pursued during the last two years by the Basle Mission on the Gold Coast, where no slaveholder can be admitted to be a communicant.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Knowing you to be a friend of humanity, and a lover of mankind, I hasten to lay before you the following matters of fact, to dispose of them as you may think fit in the columns of your all-hailed paper.\n\nI was highly delighted when reading the printed circular of the Parent Committee of the Church Missionary Society, ""On Domestic Slavery in the Yoruba Mission,"" especially their truthful assurance in the latter part of the second paragraph, and their noble and Christian desire in the latter part of the fourth paragraph.

It was scarcely possible that such an occasion should be allowed to pass without some notice of the slanderous attacks lately made in England on missionaries in Africa, and on African converts to Christianity. Towards the close of his discourse Mr. Trotter says:—\n\n“As illustrative of the teachings of the text, let me now present you with a very brief account of the life and death of a Sierra Leone Christian. If you expect anything sensational, you will be disappointed, for he was a quiet, respectable, unassuming man, in whom we have a specimen of the quality of West African Christianity. Let this, therefore, be one reply, at least, to the foul charge, that Christianity is the curse of West Africa. It will be seen that he was not connected with our own churches, but was a member of the Wesleyan Mission Church—a church which has been, and still is, of immense good to the West Coast of Africa.”\n\nMr. Trotter then gives a concise and interesting biography of his deceased friend, who appears from early life to have been a sincere, consistent, and ardent Christian, and finishes with the following remark:—\n\n“Thus lived and thus died a Sierra Leone Christian. He was my own near neighbour in Freetown for some time. We have held sweet counsel together. His image is photographed on the tablet of my memory, never to be erased. When I was sick he visited me, and when I was in trouble he comforted me. Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my last end be like his. And here let me bear my testimony to the native Christians of Sierra Leone. With some few exceptions, greater Christian kindness I never met with from any people. I have seen them live, and I have seen them die. I have seen them in the villages, and in the larger towns. I have seen them taken out of the slave ship naked and down-troden, and I have seen them civilised, educated, and Christianized, and I have no hesitation in saying, that, taking into the account their antecedents, their religion will not lose anything by being contrasted with English Christianity. Any system, therefore, or any man who would rob them of the priceless boon of Christ and Him crucified, deserves to be buried under mountains of reproach. It would be infinite cruelty to dash the cup of salvation from their lips, now, when so many of them have tasted its sweetness; rather let them continue to drink and live for ever.\n\n“In conclusion, enough has been said to prove, that our African friend, Mr. James Grafton Hazeley, was a saint of the Most High God, that his death was safe, happy, and triumphant, and that such a death was precious or right dear in the sight of the Lord.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

That the Mohammedan negro has reached a more real civilization, a higher stage of education, and a richer mean of material prosperity than his Christian brother is certain. One of the most obvious explanations of this, of course, is that while Arab missionaries have been at work in Africa for many centuries, the effort to Christianize its peoples is of very recent origin. Moreover, the negro Mohammedan has access to an ancient and poetic literature, and he has availed himself of it to a far wider extent than might be supposed. Dr. Blyden thinks that the spread of the English language will have a powerful effect in arresting the progress of Islamism; and he may be right. He is sanguine that Christianity must ultimately be the dominant faith of Africa. That it should be so is apart from purely religious considerations, of vast practical importance, since Christianity alone offers adequate safeguards against the continuance of the slave trade.

If our reason is the Society reason for removing Johnson, we say it is done from love; but if from any other motive, we question the dealings of the Society towards Johnson in this matter; for he should, at all events, have been previously made acquainted with his recall, and not by surprise, as the Society took him.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The most widespread of the witchcraft eradication movements was the Bamucapi cult of south-eastern and Central Africa which spread widely over Mozambique, Nyasaland (now Malawi), the Rhodesias (now Zim› babwe and Zambia), southern Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and Belgian Congo (now Zaire).

In Uganda, for example, a Witchcraft Ordinance was passed in 1912; in 1921 it was revised, the punishment being made severer by increasing terms of imprisonment from one to five years and also making the possession of witchcraft articles in which the power of witchcraft is believed to reside a punishable offence. 1 $^{3}$ But all these ordinances of the colonial governments and condemnation by missionaries and African converts proved to be limited deterrents to the belief in witchcraft.\nAnother attack on African traditional religion took the form of measures against initiation rites of boys and girls into adulthood.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1).

There are a certain number of people professing Christianity, but these are, for the most part, without that power of authority which restrains and influences others.

And the traders, with one exception, are as remorseless as the grave. If they can gain a few pounds of ivory or india-rubber, they care not if the liquor they sell destroys every living being in Africa. There is perfect recklessness in those who come here; no thought for anything except for the greatest gain in the two or three years they are to remain. And how many of them, when counting the few days to their departure, and seeing home and all its joys so near, were cut down in a day! Death laid his hand on them, and visions of home became dark as Erebus. And there was no miracle and no special providence in this. It was only rendering to every man according to his deeds. And if rum has killed a fourth or a third of this people since we came here, it has killed quite as large a proportion of the traders who have sold the poison. Where the foot of the white man has never trod, the fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed. Some people wonder why the Coast tribes of Africa waste away and disappear. It is no wonder to one who has lived here with his eyes open, unless he himself has come within the maelstrom. The Coast is beleaguered with the hosts of Satan; and they are bold, persistent, untiring, unscrupulous, and unmerciful.

With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition. Again, the captive African, in trading Arabia, is set free when he embraces Islam, and treated as a man and a brother, for ""all true believers are brethren."" In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion. The evils of Arabian slavery are not so bad as those resulting from the system of modern capitalism, and the trade itself is often an obstacle to the capacity of European adventurers, greedy for cheap labour, cheap ivory, and markets into which to shoot cheap home-made goods.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Terrible Story from the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In other parts of the town further human sacrifices were taking place.

In most instances holes had been bored through their feet just by the ankles. Through the holes ropes were drawn, and the men were then tied to a high tree. Their heads were, of course, hanging downwards. The men were there left to die. The traders, as they proceeded along, were unwilling witnesses of a frightful sacrificial execution. They saw a number of natives in a group, and went to the spot to see what was taking place. To their horror they saw a native tied by the feet and neck. The rope to the neck was thrown over a tree in one direction, and the rope attached to the feet was tied to a tree in the opposite direction. The ropes were then drawn tightly, and when the body was distended to its utmost length, another native with a hatchet struck the neck, and severed the head from the body. The head was taken to the grave where the King was lying, whilst the body was eaten by the natives. The white men could do nothing to stop the barbarous practices, as to interfere with these ""religious customs"" would not be tolerated by the natives, and the lives of the traders would have been in peril.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cannibalism in the Oil Rivers', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are pained to learn by the British and African Company's steamship Congo, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast on the 18th instant, that the hostilities between the New Calabar and Eckraka tribes in the Calabar River are disgraced by horrible acts of cannibalism.

Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed.

When we see the hitherto consistent friends of the high social morality of the Gospel, and preachers of the universal brotherhood of mankind, for all of whom, if they will accept the salvation He has purchased for them, Christ, our Saviour, died, fall into such grievous error, we mourn bitterly over the declension which we feel we are right in attributing to the heathen influences by which they are surrounded.\n\nIt is not our desire to gain any distinction by argument or invective over our fellow-labourers who have so unhappily yielded for a moment to the power of circumstances.

They know but too well that the heathen of Abeokuta are manstealers. In justifying the practice of slavery to which the heathen cling, and which is working such frightful evils—which is, indeed, at the root of the social degradation of the country—they are, for a fancied momentary benefit, neutralising to a very great extent their powers for good. Any departure from the lofty standard of Christian principle must do this. And by implication, in thus defending slavery, without one word in condemnation of the manstealing practised around them, or of the horrible trade in which the slave-ship whose capture they record was engaged, they may be supposed, although we are sure they had no such intention, to justify both the one and the other.\n\nIf we had previously, which we had not, entertained the least doubt of the correctness of our view, that for the spread of civilisation and Christianity in Africa there must be the influence of a Christian power behind and around the propagators of the truth, that doubt would now have been removed. Such a defence or excuse of slavery would never have been published by a Christian missionary in Sierra Leone, or in Lagos.

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished.

Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends.

As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded.

We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""?

As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end.

In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

In the neighbouring islands, as a result of Protestant mission work, a \'black culture\' had already taken shape in various movements such as that of the Rastafarians (a Messianic wave of reaction against the white overlord in which African imagery was thinly veiled, Haile Sellassie being cast as Messiah). On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

A mission had been established two or three years since in that hotbed of slavery and the slave-trade; and it appears the effort has been crowned with singular success. After one or two other speeches, the King stood up and took a step or two in advance of his seat, and to the great delight and surprise of the assembled multitude, addressed them in his native tongue, although he reads and writes and speaks English perfectly well. He said: ""It hath pleased the Lord, in the depths of His inscrutable wisdom, to call me this day to be your ruler; but my greatest glory is finding myself this night in your midst as one of yourselves—a Christian. It is now nearly twenty years ago since my late Royal father died. I was then excluded from the succession by the chiefs, because, and only because, I preferred to serve the true God; rather than make oblations to the Fetishes of my forefathers. I was a marked man, and accused of being an enemy to my country, because I took no delight in sacrifices; but the Spirit of the Lord upheld me through all my troubles, as I will now relate to you. Many, many years ago, long before any Christian minister had ever visited these parts (the missions were established in 1832), myself and my two late companions, the late Joseph de Graft and the late John Sam, used to assemble at one another\'s houses occasionally and dip into the mysteries of the blessed Bible. My father, the late King, had permitted me to visit during my youth the then very imperfect colonial school, more with the view of satisfying my childish caprice than in the hope of my picking up any useful information. The little I learnt there I greatly, very greatly improved by help of my two friends. Myself and my two friends got regularly into the practice of having Scripture readings and prayers at our houses; and first one friend, then another, and another joined, until at last we began to have a goodly muster every time we met. Some of the chiefs and Fetish priests began to be alarmed at our proceedings, as subversive of all order and their time-honoured institutions, and took us before the Governor of those days, who cast us into prison. We were then enjoined to return to the Fetish worship of our fathers; and when we refused, we were publicly flogged at the castle gate. There are hundreds of persons still living who were witnesses of the indignity put upon us. After being confined some time, and scourged again and again, we were cast out of prison, as utterly unworthy the further solicitude of the chiefs and Fetishmen for our future welfare; and they said they must leave it with the Fetishes themselves to deal with us after our deserts. About the time we were released from prison a Bristol trading vessel arrived at Cape Coast; the master, one Captain Potter, had been trading a long time on the Coast, and was well known. We visited this good Bristolian at the house he stayed at, and requested an interview with him. We related all our troubles and trials to him, and the punishments we had undergone, and desired the good captain to assist us with his friendly advice. He told us to address a letter to the Wesleyan Methodist Society in London. He said he had a friend in Bristol, a minister of that persuasion, and he felt no doubt but that he could get the letter forwarded to London, and that our petition would be favourably considered by the managing committee. The letter was written and signed by all three of us, and handed over to Captain Potter. Some few short years elapsed, and then we saw the result of our petition to the Society in London in the advent of a missionary, **the first that had ever visited these parts;** and now, this night, we behold the mighty glory of the Lord, His power and majesty, and His overflowing love, in the sight which now presents itself to us. And this is only part of the fruit of that small seed we planted in those days.

As they all knew that he had only paid fourteen bags for me, they all returned without saying anything more.\n\nMr. Robbin then put me in chains, in which I remained for five days in his house; and after that he handed me over to one Lumeye, a slavedealer, who shaved my head and kept me in chains at his house for seven days, and was preparing to take me, as he said, to Okeodan. Lumeye said to me himself that, as the people had begged Mr. Robbin and failed, I should be quiet and not run away, as he would not sell me at Okeodan as he was requested by Mr. Robbin, but that he would sell me to the son of the late King of Porto Novo, who will treat me kindly.\n\nAfter Mr. Robbin had handed me over to Lumeye, I am told, he went to the Reverend Mr. Townsend and informed him that my former master had claimed me from him, and had taken me away.\n\nAfter I remained in chains at Lumeye's house for seven days, I was glad to find on the night of the seventh day that the chains fell off from me during a very strong wind that was then blowing. I then wrapped the chains in my cloth and escaped. I left the chains in an Oro bush at Illugun.

It has not succeeded to root itself in the soil; to get the people generally to identify their interest and their lives with its existence and that of its institutions, and exercise towards it that devotion which they or their ancestors had exhibited towards heathenism.\n\nThere is no strong guarantee for permanence and continuity in this exotic character, and Africans who believe in the regenerating power of the religion and wish to see it cover the whole country, who have some knowledge of its fate in North Africa, after many centuries of existence, and of the complete failure of even its Roman Catholic form in comparatively more recent times after over two centuries of existence, and who are not altogether ignorant of the causes of these repeated and signal failures, are naturally anxious to see a repetition of the sad and terrible calamity avoided."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-12-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished. Once the negro was attacked in the right spirit, and with a suitable choice of weapons from the Christian armoury, he ventured to predict even more splendid results to Christianity than had ever marked the progress of Islam."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Degraded State of Accra—Female School Wanted', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—It is now many years past since the establishment of the Gospel in this place, and it is shameful to notice the very little progress which is made towards Christianizing the people of Accra.

In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A friend of Africa would naturally be guided by the practical result of the religious and other means adopted for her elevation in the social scale, and her enjoyment of those advantages which Christianity alone possesses.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

It is nearly as old as recorded  \nhistory. It has interested thinking men in Europe and Asia in  \nall ages. The imagination of the ancients peopled the interior  \nof that country with a race of beings shut out from and needing  \nno intercourse with the rest of mankind—lifted by their purity  \nand simplicity of character above the necessity of intercourse  \nwith other mortals. The Greeks especially had very high con-  \nceptions of the sanctity and spirituality of the interior Africans.  \nIndeed, the religion of some portion of Greece is supposed to  \nhave been introduced from Africa. But leaving the region of  \nmythology, we know that the three highest religions known to  \nmankind—if they had not their origin in Africa—were domiciled  \nthere in the days of their feeble beginnings, Judaism, Christianity,  \nand Mohammedanism.  \nA sacred mystery hung over that continent, and many were  \nthe aspirations of philosophers and poets for some definite  \nknowledge of what was beyond the narrow fringe they saw.\n\nThe mystery still remains. The problem continues unsolved. The conquering races of the world stand perplexed before the difficulties which beset their enterprise of reducing that continent to subjection. Europe has extended her conquests to Australia, New Zealand, and the Archipelagos of the Pacific. But, for hundreds of years, their ships have passed by those tempting regions, where ""Afric\'s sunny fountains roll down their golden sands,"" and have been able to acquire no extensive foothold in that country. The points actually occupied by white men in the equatorial regions of that continent may be represented on the map only by microscopic dots. The bulk of Central Africa is being rapidly subjected to Mohammedanism. That system is, knitting together the conquerors and the conquered into a harmonious whole; and unless Europe gets a thorough understanding of the situation, the gates of missionary enterprise will be closed.

In contrast, The African Times articles offer several details supporting the claim, describing violent practices such as the crucifixion of Christians, exemplified by the case of Mr. Doherty, a Christian teacher who was reportedly crucified but later found alive. The articles also recount massacres of captives, including beheadings and the use of skulls, with the king's religious beliefs not deterring these atrocities. The king's involvement and justification of these practices as traditional customs are noted, indicating that his religious beliefs did not mitigate the violence. However, the articles do not specifically mention crucifixion as a widespread practice, focusing more on beheadings and other forms of execution. This absence of specific mention of crucifixion as a common practice is a notable difference from the claim.

Motivated by considerations of state security and by the insatiable demand for slaves for export, for labour for both cash crop and subsistence agri› culture for the state and for the purpose of human sacrifice at the wellknown annual customs, the invasion affected not only the Yoruba west of the Ogun river. Equally affected were the Aja and Manhi communities and states east of the Werne river, including Porto Novo. 25 While the invasion of the Mahi immediately north of Agbome and of Porto Novo in the south-east was carried out in the 1820s, in the 1830s the concentration was on such Egbado towns as Ijanna and Refurefu, which were razed to the ground in 1831 and 1836 respectively. Ijanna, as noted above, was the residence of the Oyo imperial agent and the main centre for collecting and forwarding tributes from the Egbado and neighbouring area. In the 1840s and again in the 1880s, Okeodan and Sabe were ravaged. Also in the latter decade, the kingdom of Ketu, which began to be harassed in the late 1870s, was finally destroyed in 1886, four years after Imeko, the one other major town within the kingdom, had been burnt down.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The collapse of Old Oyó', 'content': 'In the 1850s and 1860s, an important target was the new Egba-Yoruba state of Abeokuta whose rise was viewed in Agbome as a threat to the independence of Dahomey. This danger became real with Egba military activities and associated political expansion into the areas of western Yoru› baland where Dahomey was also conducting its raids. The clash between the two in the Awori town of Ado-Odo in 1844 and the eventual defeat of Dahomey, sowed the seeds of future acrimony between the two. Although the two direct attacks that Dahomey conducted against Abeokuta in 1851 and 1864 met with resounding failure, the punitive expedition against Egbado allies of the Egba led to the destruction of Isaga in 1862 and the attendant devastation of the surrounding area. Dahomeyan raids against the Yoruba in the upper reaches of the Ogun river continued into the late i88os and early 1890s and were, in fact, not terminated until the defeat of the Fon kingdom by the French in 1892.\nThe Dahomey wars of the nineteenth century, like the other wars of the period, were not necessarily inter-ethnic conflicts. This point is easily proved not only by the Dahomey invasion of Aja communities in the Werne river valley but also by the devastating war against Porto Novo in the late 1880s and early 1890s following the breakdown of an accord that was reached shortly after the invasions of the 1820s and that had for decades thereafter guaranteed peaceful relations between the two Aja states and their satellites.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""Indeed, the Dahomey authorities could not appreciate the demand which several British and French abolitionist delegations made on them to stop the trade, given the willingness of the Brazil-based Portuguese dealers to continue transacting the business in Dahomey ports.\nNevertheless, Dahomey realized that changes were taking place. Its adjustment to changing times was noticeable from the mid-century when, under the influence of a French trading firm, Victor RØgis, King Gezo (c. 1818-58) of Dahomey was persuaded to intensify the trade in palm oil, first as a supplement to the export of slaves and eventually as the dominant factor in the state's export economy.$^{41}$ The transition from slave to 'legi› timate' trade meant a corresponding increase in the need to retain war captives as labour for the maintenance and expansion of the palm oil industry. Slaves also came to be used more for transporting goods from the interior to the coast and vice-versa than as commodities for export. By the time of the French conquest of 1892-4, the foundation of Dahomey's new economy - the monoculture of palm produce - had already been laid.

This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army. Between January 1891 and August 1892 he purchased, '1,700 rapid-firing rifles, six Krupp cannon of various bore, five machine-guns, 400,000 assorted cartridges and a large quantity of shell'$^{31}$ from German firms operating in Lome."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states.

Though this wave of millenarian movements had subsequently gradually died down in the sedentary parts of the Sudan, the Mahdists remained active in Därfür (see Fig. 4.1). Many assumed for themselves messianic prophecy and declared a djihäd against the 'infidel' British rule. The most important of them was fakt 'Abdullah al-Sihaynï, the leader of the Nyäla revolt of 1921.\nLike its predecessors, the Nyäla revolt aimed at the repudiation of the 'infidel' colonial rule and the restoration of the 'glorious' Mahdiyya in the Sudan. Beside this fundamental religious drive, the imposition of a centralized colonial administration, increase in the herd tax, and the overestimation of the $^{ l}$ushœr, were all other factors that provoked the people in Därfür to join the revolt. 23 Led by al-Sihaynï, a force of about five thousand warriors attacked Nyäla fort and the market on 26 September 1921. They gained control of the fort and set fire to a nearby building. Al-Sihaynï launched a second attack that could have driven the enemy into confusion had he not been seriously wounded. The colonial casualties in this round were forty-three killed and twenty-one wounded, while at least six hundred Sudanese died in action.\nThough al-Sihaynï was publicly hanged on 4 October, his adherents continued the struggle. They concentrated a force of about five thousand men some 80 km from Nyäla. Faced with these dangerous developments, colonial officials sent a strong punitive force that toured southern Därfür. It arrested many people, burned their houses, seized their cattle and confiscated their property. By May 1922, this period of resistance in Dar Masalït had ended.\nThe Nyäla revolt was certainly the most important revolt against colonialism in the Sudan before 1924.

One was a celebrated slavetrader, now dead; the other an equally well-known native merchant. The King of Dahomey, on a certain occasion, expressed a curiosity to ascertain the exact appearance presented by an infant whilst in the womb, and in order to gratify that diabolical curiosity, this religious monarch ordered one of his female subjects who was in an advanced state of pregnancy to be brought before him. I cannot write what followed, as it would be too disgusting; but suffice it to say, that the King, having satisfied his curiosity, exclaimed, ""Is that all?"" There are those still living that can corroborate this. Now, I should say that one whose religion would not deter him from committing a crime which I believe to be unparalleled would not hesitate to order the slaughter of any number of his helpless dependents. Everybody knows that he often does so, and every honest man who knows it will also candidly admit it.\n\nI have now a very few words more to add. I would respectfully caution the British public from attaching too much importance or faith to the tales of writers who, like ""An African,"" have had no personal experience of the men or things they enlarge upon, and whose knowledge thereof is derived from fifth-rate sources. Government officials who come out to the Gold Coast for a couple of years or less, who seldom move outside the Castle at Cape Coast, and who glean their information on all they intend to write about from their boys or from ignorant people of the lowest class (who just ""look in"" to get a glass of the white newsmonger\'s gin), cannot be expected to furnish the public with literary food of a healthy quality. So far as actual experience of matters goes, King Badahung is just as competent to put forth an opinion respecting the existing disputes between the Poles and Russians, or between the Northern and Southern States of America, as his ""friend,"" ""An African,"" is to undertake the task he has attempted.\n\nThis individual (always supposing his identity to be established beyond dispute, which, in point of fact, it is) very recently wrote to a friend of his at Cape Coast to announce his impending return to his post in almost these words: ""I am returning, not because I am obliged, or because I have any affection for the place, but I have a game to play, and, by Jove, I\'ll come and play it out too, in spite of all obstacles."" No doubt this letter is his first card.

Their crime was that they did not come to the custom for his father, and they laughed at those who came from some towns behind them to present things to the King for the custom.

But the Illustrated News has thus offended. In its number of Sept. 6, à propos of the dancers of Dahomey, it asserts that those horrible massacres, those human sacrifices in the customs of Dahomey, ""are neither more nor less than the solemn execution of a number of criminals and prisoners of war who have been legally condemned to death, and whose decapitation is superintended by the monarch with more formal ceremony than is used by the civilized Governments of Europe.""

I have been to several places, such as the Niger, Abeokuta, Jebu, &c.; from Abeokuta to Lagos, from Lagos to Badagry, and from Badagry to Porto Novo. I remained in Porto Novo five days, and went from there to Goodomeh and Whydah. I was at Whydah when these rows commenced, of which I cannot say a word. The people advised me, if I was English, to get out of the country; so, after ten (10) days, I left for Porto Novo. I saw many things were done there which are very bad. I never saw a place so wicked, as these two countries, Dahomey and Porto Novo; but Dahomey was a larger country than Porto Novo. I stayed in Porto Novo for only six months, but I saw things in the country much as what I have seen at Dahomey, and took account of everything. I saw it in people bound with ropes on their back; killing or shedding human beings\' blood; people killed like fowls every day and night at Dahomey. I saw the same in Porto Novo the first day of my arrival from Whydah. In Porto Novo town itself they have about thirty (30) chiefs, who have each a prison-house in the country. In the chiefs\' houses for prisoners there were from 400 to 600 and upward. The King also has his own prison-house, and no end of people were in his prison, too. The princes in villages, chiefs and all, have their prison-houses. The prisoners have no better food to eat than raw corn, chaff, &c.; all their food was nasty, and the stench may well make men die. I asked some of the people of these men in prison, why they were put in this distress, and they told me that most of them were put there on account of some foolish case, and some of them did not know any reason. People are dying in the prison-houses daily, and they are always thrown into a well behind the French factory. The King used to kill at night in secret, but not in day—I mean, there he used to kill men and women. They do everything in Porto Novo to imitate Dahomey; so, therefore, the countries of Porto Novo and Dahomey are equally bad. I was in the country in the month of November, 1875. It was on Sunday I went to see Mr. E. K. T. Bickersteth, who was my best friend, and kind to everybody. He was in evening service, and some of the Porto Novians took fight to his place, and flogged his father, cut him with knives on his hand, beat him with sticks, and nearly put him to death before his son, Mr. Bickersteth, came from church. When he came, he saw the whole yard full of people, and his father bleeding. When the people saw him they all ran away, crying, in their native tongue, ""Togunu gor! Togunu gor!"" which means ""Togunu come! Togunu come!"" Soon the whole of them rushed inside again, to fight Togunu Bickersteth. He ran upstairs, while his boys were fighting, the people cutting them with knives, and beating them with sticks, &c., until one man fell down on the ground, when the people all ran away, but left this wounded man on the ground. So the man was lifted up by Mr. Bickersteth and led to the halfway. While he was leading him, the women set on Mr. Bickersteth, saying in their tongue, ""Togunu, you kill a man; Togunu, you kill a man,"" while he cut nobody, and beat no man. So the wounded man went home, and many of Mr. Bickersteth\'s people got wounded too; and while he was seeing to his men and washing their wounds, I saw the King Tofa\'s staff come inside to Mr. Bickersteth, with much people. The King had sent to call him at night, and he refused to go that night, and told the people to tell the King that he would appear to the call on the morrow. So these people went away back to the King Tofa, and delivered the message. On the next day, which was the 1st November, 1875, I awoke early in the morning to see him. I saw a crowd of people in his house, and observed that they were the King\'s messengers. So he did not wait a minute, but made haste to go with them to the King\'s palace, and I went with them too, to see how heathen people judge their case. We enter the palace; many people were there sitting down, and Mr. Bickersteth had to walk through them to reach to the King\'s face.

If the new King persists in remaining in the interior with his prisoners, and refuses to treat for their release, it is clear that the French Government will be forced to take serious measures to protect the lives of its subjects. M. Etienne\'s speech in the Chamber of Deputies recently was a model of what a Ministerial explanation under such circumstances ought to be. This is not a case of more or less imaginary Kroumirs or Black Flags, whose depredations afford an excuse for an act of aggression and conquest. The King has repeatedly attacked the French stations on the coast, and although his forces have been repulsed, he declares he will not rest till he has driven the strangers out. Moreover, a French missionary and five civilians have been seized at Whydah and carried up the country, where, if not rescued, a horrible fate awaits them. All this points in only one direction, and Europeans may at any time hear that the kingdom of Dahomey is condemned to disappear as an independent State. That the Ffons can hope seriously to resist a French force is out of the question. Imbued though they are with savage ferocity, the Dahomeyans are no match for disciplined troops and machine guns. Indeed, of late it is affirmed that the reputation of the people for brute courage is no longer so well deserved as of old. But they are bloodthirsty and vindictive, and reckless of their lives when roused. They may give the French a great deal of trouble, and as women form the backbone of the Dahomeyan Army, it must be an unusually repulsive duty for the ""Grande Nation"" to enter into hostilities with them. Its Amazonian warriors and the bloody ""customs"" are the two characteristics of Dahomey which have kept it so prominently before the eye of civilisation. The country itself is of little value. Abomey, the capital, is situated about sixty-five miles from the coast. Whydah, the only seaport of any consequence, is the part of the kingdom with which Europeans are best acquainted. Here there are trading forts and ""factories"" belonging to the English, French, Portuguese, and Brazilians, which were places of importance during the days of the slave trade. Then the barracoons were crammed with human chattels, while the King was hunting down the neighbouring tribes in order to keep up the supply of that ""black ivory"" from which he derived such ample wealth. When this traffic came to an end, Whydah sank into insignificance, and is now simply a place of some 12,000 inhabitants, from which palm oil is shipped when the surf permits communications between vessel and shore.

Several European friends went to visit Ibara and the site of the Dahomey camp on the Tuesday. The impression conveyed to them was that the Dahomans were not so strong as they have been thought to be; one person supposed them to have been not above 10,000 fighting persons, men and women. The camp, seen from Abeokuta, was only a part arranged in three single lines, with a considerable space between the end of one line and the beginning of another, as if to make the best possible appearance, if seen from a distance. The camp behind Ibara was larger, in which the King was present, for whom a superior dwelling was erected, as seen by the remains. One of those who went to see the spot, remarked that they were evidently in great fear, for their huts are everywhere a good gunshot off from Ibara bush, as if afraid it would give cover to an enemy. It was reported in Abeokuta that of some prisoners they had taken one had escaped, stating that the Dahomans pierced their hands or arms just above the wrist, and passed a cord through the wound, to tie them, and ensure their not getting free. One of the gentlemen who visited the site was desirous of testing the truth of this statement. He examined the body of a man, and found on his arm a wound above the wrist as described. Another individual was anxious to know whether the bodies had been otherwise maimed, as described to him, and verified its truth by inspection. One of the native Christians reporting that he had seen many dead bodies, headless corpses, but that they were chiefly old men, was asked how he could tell they were old. He remarked that their scalps were there, and the hair was grey. The Dahomans seek to secure skulls, and after beheading a man have a process of cleaning it, as the skull is the only valuable part. Thus their own friends who fall in battle are beheaded, and their skulls taken home. Who can distinguish between the skull of friend or foe? Several reports are rife as to the doings of the Dahomans after leaving this place. The first was that they had attacked and destroyed Ishala, a town in league with them, but it was not true, and again, that the Okeodan people and others had attacked them on their way home; but this also we believe to have no foundation in truth. Whilst they were at Ibara they destroyed several small towns in its neighbourhood; those named are Illewo, Kesson, and Ijalle. As mentioned before, the Ibara people were attacked by the Abeokuta people. It appears they were going off or coming to Abeokuta, that some of the Abeokuta and Ijaye people heard of it, and thinking to get plunder, went to meet them. They endeavoured to plunder; the Ibara people remonstrated and resisted. A fight ensued, in which many on both sides fell, including the Chief of Ibara, and they were captured. As soon as the chiefs of Abeokuta heard of it they were filled with indignation at the conduct of their people, and have used every means since to give liberty to every one thus taken. Sentence of death was passed on the individual who shot the Chief of Ibara.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among the passengers on board the mail steamer Lagos, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast of Africa early in November, are the Dahomeyan envoys, sent by King Behanzin to confer with the French Government, with a view to peace. The party includes the king\'s great chiefs, Chedingar and Ayumkuken; his messenger, Tassah; Mr. Henry Dasos, an interpreter, and Mr. John P. Jackson, editor of *The Lagos Record*. The chiefs stoutly deny that the King of Dahomey is the inhuman monster he has been represented to be. They affirm that no human sacrifices are offered in Dahomey, except at the annual ""Royal custom,"" which, however, has been suspended for the past four years. At this custom all the royal maidens are required to fetch water from the sacred streams of Golutar. This water is sprinkled in the royal mausoleum, after which sacrifices of sheep and oxen are made by the fetish priest, followed by a human sacrifice, the victim being commissioned to convey messages to the spirits of the deceased kings, and to invoke their guidance and protection for the throne and kingdom. The chiefs, in support of the foregoing, assert that of the 4,000 Yorubas captured in the last raid at Abeokuta four years ago, not one has been offered in sacrifice, and that it is a capital offence to shed human blood in Dahomey, and also that any chief or prince who would cause one of his servants to be beaten so that he fainted would be imprisoned for life.

The little cloud of Herzegovinian insurrection which rose suddenly last year on the Eastern horizon has spread until there is now active hostility between Turkey and Servia and Montenegro; while there are strong indications that its dark folds will soon also envelope Roumania. In a word, the area of conflict is extending in those countries, and it is by no means impossible that Turkey will soon have really to fight its ""battle of life"" against its revolted dependencies, which are seemingly determined, if possible, to cast off entirely the rule and suzerainté of the great Mohammedan empire. Notwithstanding the deep interest which we naturally feel in this spreading war darkness and its possible results, our thoughts are not the less turned toward that barbarous State in West Africa which, according to the latest news, seems to be determined, in its heathen ignorance and insolence, to oppose its puny might to the strength of Great Britain. To the English mind nothing can, of course, appear more ridiculous than war between Great Britain and Dahomey. It could only be a collision between an earthen and an iron pot, with the one inevitable result; for we presume that if the monster of Dahomey should really make it necessary for Great Britain to send an expedition into his country, there will not be a repetition in his case of the grievous error that has been committed in Ashanti—error which has doubtless not been without its influence at Abomey. A few hours\' occupation of that blood-stained place, and the destruction of one or more of the extensive royal huts which are dignified with the name of ""palaces,"" would not by any means respond to the necessities of the situation. Habitually watching events in Western Africa as under the guidance of Divine Providence, we thought that we foresaw in the very act of the formation of the Gold Coast Colony (following after the Ashanti expedition) the beginning of the end of Dahomey as a State in West Africa. Our readers will perhaps remember that we expressed this belief very strongly at the time. It was from our point of view clearly impossible, the Gold Coast and Lagos being united in one Gold Coast Colony, that the little semi-Dahoman villages between Quittah and Whydah, with this latter and Godomey, could continue for any length of time under other rule and control than that of the Governor of the Gold Coast Colony, acting for and in the name of Queen Victoria. We did not, of course, see in advance what event was to bring up the ""little cloud"" on the Dahoman horizon. But little clouds are constantly arising in West African horizons, and the ignorant pride and cupidity of Dahoman rulers might well be trusted to raise such a one as that which necessitated the visit of Commodore Sir William Hewett to Whydah, and the infliction by him of a fine on the King and State of Dahomey. The King\'s insolent refusal to pay this fine had made it imperative to blockade Whydah and the neighbouring sea-coast villages or towns east and west of that place; and such blockade commenced, we doubt not, as appointed by Her Majesty\'s Government, on the 1st of July. The question now naturally arises whether the payment of the fine originally inflicted ought to free the King of Dahomey, since he has imposed on Great Britain the trouble and expense of sending a fleet of ships of war to enforce it. We think not. Independently of our anxious desire to see Dahomey extinguished as an independent State, we feel that the petty barbarians along the West Coast ought to have full conviction brought home to them by a signal example that the majesty of Great Britain is not to be insulted and defied with impunity. It is for the benefit of Benin, Brass, Bonny, Opobo, Old and New Calabar, and Cameroons, that this conviction should become fully impressed on the minds of the people and rulers of those places. They ought to be made thoroughly to understand by one great example that whenever their misdeeds render it necessary to impose a fine on them, that fine must be paid without the necessity being created of the presence of a squadron to enforce and receive payment. As regards precedent for this, we need not be in any doubt. Since Germany exacted five thousand millions of francs from France for the trouble and expense of beating her armies, forcing an entrance into her capital, and stripping her of Alsace and Lorraine, we have a precedent for all time, ample to cover every demand that irresistible power may make and enforce. Dahomey has given Great Britain occasion to exercise control over her affairs. She has continuously injured the British Settlement at Lagos by her annual inroads into the Egba territory in quest of plunder, slaves, and victims, to be slaughtered in the ""Customs"" at Abomey. British remonstrance has been useless—received with little less than contempt. Those slave-hunting raids and fearful butcheries, at the behest of a sanguinary superstition, are said to be absolutely necessary to the continued existence of the Dahoman kingdom. No stronger evidence can surely be required of the absolute necessity of destroying such a kingdom. Our readers will find in another column the account given by an escaped Liberian, named ""Tubman,"" who was captured by the Dahomans under the walls of Abeokuta during one of those annual incursions. The narrative is full of food for thought at this time, and we think it will be read with deep interest. Since that was in type we have received a second edition of it from another and very able native correspondent. In this account he says: ""The 800 captives taken with Tubman were men, women, children, and infants, kidnapped and otherwise taken in the Egba farms. When they arrived at Abomey, which they reached in six days (there was much halting on the way), they were taken to the high priest of the national gods. It was for him to decide who were to be sacrificed, and who to be spared. He divined by means of water and kola nuts. In this way 150 of Tubman\'s fellow-captives were selected for a grand sacrifice which was offered in December last. Tubman was assigned to a priest of ""Shango,"" the God of Thunder, to be one of his attendants. Shango priests are held in much superstitious dread, the King greatly supporting them. It is customary to administer to all captives who are not to be sacrificed, but distributed between the King, his warriors, priests, and others, a ""Lethe,"" so that they may forget home and its associations, and have no inclination to escape. This ""Lethe"" consists of boiling spirits mixed with the blood of a slave, flowing fresh from his throat, which is cut while his head is held over the steaming spirits, which have also some vegetable powders mixed with them. The slave whose blood is to be thus drank by his companions is always thus killed in their presence. A good quantity of this preparation is administered to each. None dare refuse it. Tubman had to drink about half a pint of this vile and abominable preparation."" This is the Dahomey with which Great Britain is now brought into collision—a land drunk with the blood of victims, shed to gratify the brutal passions of the dominant section of its people, and the inordinate thirst of its so-called gods. Let it be remembered that these cruel butcheries and vile abominations are continual, from day to day and year to year. Are we not, then, justified in saying that, having now a pretext for interference with a kingdom which thus stains the earth, and which greatly injures our neighbouring possessions, it is our duty, as evidently charged with the propaganda of civilization and the vindication of the rights of humanity on the West Coast, to extend our arm in the small degree necessary to put an end at once and for ever to one of the most monstrous systems that ever encumbered and insulted this earth?

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round.

He knew that the impression they had acquired from various sources was that the beneficent results were enormous; but he had been enabled to see for himself the nature of those results and to draw his own conclusions, and he appeared before them to put a pin into the beautiful iridescent bubble which they had blown for themselves with the materials supplied by the ignorant, the interested, the colour-blind, and the hopelessly biassed. Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present. To the slave and gin trades, and that in gunpowder and guns, must he ascribed the frightful evils they had brought upon the negro race, beside which the good they had tried to achieve was hardly discernible."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MAHOMEDANISM IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The progress of Islam forms the subject of an interesting article in the current number of *Fraser*, entitled ""Mahomedanism and the Negro Race,"" written, as we are informed in an editorial note, by Mr. Edward W.

Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance.

The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""DR.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce.

This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down.

He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves.

After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested.

Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

Her first response was to forbid baptism in 1832. Three years later all her subjects were prohibited from becoming or remaining Christians. The preaching of Christianity was banned, but the ban did not apply to secular education. Explaining the reasons for her decision, Ranavalona told the British missionaries, whom she summoned to her palace on 26 February 1835, that: While she thanked them for the good services they had rendered to the country, and while they were at liberty to follow their own religious customs, she would not permit her subjects to depart from their old customs ...

The zeal with which the missionaries worked, after their return to Madagascar in 1861, clearly indicated that there would soon be a religious revolution in the country, country.

The Catholics were very active in the Betsileo country and among the subject peoples, who developed a kind of people's Christianity alongside the official religion.

It was at a time when Britain appeared - and posed as Madagascar's true friend and ally, and British missionaries in Madagascar were not slow to emphasize this time and again. Through men such as James Cameron, the LMS had given a great deal of technical assistance to the Malagasy, and Rainilaiarivony and his colleagues believed that by embracing the LMS's brand of Christianity they would further cement this friendship. In fact, by embracing Protestantism they would draw closer to Britain as allies who could be expected to take their side should difficulties occur again with the French.

The first was the political evolution of the country and the diplomatic interaction between Madagascar and foreign powers, particularly Britain and France. Second, major changes took place in the social organization of the country, par› ticularly in the religious, administrative and economic fields. Political evolution consisted mainly of the consolidation of the Merina monarchy and the expansion of its authority to the rest of the island. The diplomatic relations that this monarchy maintained with both Britain and France became a cornerstone of the country's development. The changes that were effected in administration, particularly in the establishment of law and order, facilitated economic development.

There are some eighteen ethnic groups in Madagascar of which the largest and, as it turned out, the most important in the nineteenth century, are the Merina who live on the central plateau of the island.

They also wanted to buy luxury goods such as cloth and alcohol and to expand their exports, mainly cattle and rice, to Mauritius and RØunion in order to pay for the necessary imports. Queen Ranavalona therefore wanted to find a modus vivendi with the Europeans, to enable her country to develop without the fear of European antagonism and war. In pursuit of this policy, she and her advisers decided in 1836 to send an embassy to France and England and to negotiate fresh treaties of friendship and commerce, based on respect for Malagasy culture and independence and to secure recognition for Ranavalona I as Queen of Madagascar.$^{29}$ The Malagasy embassy - the first ever to be sent to Europe - consisted of six officers and two secretaries and was led by Andriantsitchaina.$^{30}$ Their stay in Paris was uneventful and they then crossed the Channel to London.

A more extortionate ultimatum was rarely presented to a defeated country than that which the French put forward in this instance. Its character and tenor are such as to produce but one result. Briefly recapitulated, its demands are: The establishment of a French protectorate over the whole northern part of the island; an indemnity of 3,000,000 francs; full indemnification for all losses sustained by foreigners during the war, and the degradation of the reigning monarch by substituting for her present title of ""Queen of Madagascar,"" that of ""Queen of the Hovas."" This last condition, by itself, would have insured the rejection of the ultimatum, and the world will, consequently, be apt to conclude it was inserted for that very purpose. Whatever the behaviour of the Hova army in the field, only one end can attend this wretched war. The correspondent of the Standard, with the Queen\'s army, telegraphed two or three days since that the French forces, twelve hundred strong, attacked the Hova\'s camp on the 27th of June last, and that the attack lasted two hours, at the end of which time the French retired. But this temporary success practically counts for nothing, nor the fact further stated by the correspondent—that the Malagasy troops behaved admirably, displaying perfect coolness and firing steadily. For even if the entire expedition, which it is announced is able to start for the interior, were to meet with defeat and be compelled to scramble back to the coast, another and a more formidable one would be forthwith organized, and, again, another if that were discomfited. The only prospect, faint as it is, of any abandonment of the proposed French advance upon and occupation of Antananarivo lies in the small credit—only some £250,000—asked for and obtained by the Government during the past week. The expenditure sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies will not cover any very extensive operations, and, therefore, for the present, at all events, French aggression will be limited to the retention of Tamatave and Magunga, and the occupation of some points on the north coast. In the interests of the young Christian civilization, which it is one of the most glorious triumphs of English mission-work to have created in the great African island, we shall continue to hope that circumstances will arise in the future to avert the terrible calamity of a complete invasion of the country by French troops.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Dinner to the Envoys from Madagascar', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""At a court dinner, given on December 13, by the Fishmongers' Company, the principal guests were his Excellency Ravoninahitriniarivo, first Envoy, and his Excellency Ramaniraka, second Envoy from Madagascar, who, with the Rev.

Subsequently a message was brought to him as from his ancestors, to the effect that, if he did not stop \'the praying,\' some great calamity would soon befall him. To the surprise of his best friends, the King was exceedingly interested in this strange movement, seemed to believe the pretended message from the world of spirits, and encouraged the frantic dancers, who daily thronged his house, and declared that the disease would continue to increase till \'the praying\' was stopped.

Lands of forests and swamps, roadless as the African bush, inhabited for the most part by naked populations, whose bodies were protected and ornamented by fat and paint, upon the altars of whose false gods human victims were offered—human blood was constantly flowing! Need we say more? True, these people were of fair complexion, and so beautiful, that captives from among them carried to Rome excited general admiration. But with this difference, what is there in the state and condition of Africa and the African people that could not have found a parallel in the state and condition of these now most highly-favoured countries and peoples? Nothing really. Evil ruled in them as as it rules now in Africa, and it produced there fruits that attend its sway everywhere, and which make the greater portion of native Africa so loathsome. These countries emerged from their barbarism. How? By their own unaided effort? No. The pre-existing civilising agencies, imperfect and corrupt though they were, were brought to bear upon them. The Romans formed high military roads through them. Successive invasions, military colonies, the influence of new inhabitants, worked gradual changes. And then the great and glorious life-giving light of Christianity came in with its mighty transforming powers. Look at Europe now. It is far from being all that a Christian would desire.

I have never heard of any people on the West Coast settlements, boasting as we do of civilization, and having the advantages of becoming a more Christian and enlightened people, in whom the natural propensity to worldly pleasures and enjoyments is so powerfully predominant. The aged and the young, parents with their children, males and females, are to be seen in crowds in different quarters of the town, night and day, abandoning themselves to revelry and licentiousness which it is truly painful to behold. Here are large preparations making for a grand country ball which all must attend, and at which grey-headed dames are to be seen teaching the young ones how to dance; there, in the next street, is a host of men and women, boys and girls, drinking and rioting—a funeral custom for a relation who died months ago; and in most cases of this kind a family is put in deep distress and pawned afterwards, to pay for the ruin consumed on the occasion. In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer. All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FERNANDO PO.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Mr. Editor,—Allow me to bring or give to the public a few scraps of information respecting the present state of Fernando Po. This country, which, ever since the Baptist Mission was driven out of her, had sunk into a state of deep degradation, is now coming, I can assure you, Mr. Editor, to a state of importance. Fernando Po, which had lost the sweetness of the Gospel of Christ for upwards of eleven years, has now been allowed it again. She is now furnished with three able missionaries from the Primitive Methodist Connexion in England, two of whom are for its metropolis and the other for a very beautiful part of Fernando Po called North-West Bay, very splendid for an English settlement. A temporary chapel has been occupied, and a day-school has been established. The day-school is increasing by degrees, and, under God's protection and blessing, is making a very rapid improvement. Thank God, Mr. Editor, that from what we see of the school at present there is nothing to be complained of. The school is governed by the two able young men from that blessed peninsula of Sierra Leone who gave themselves entirely to that mission to work for God. We wish that the people of Sierra Leone will pray for these their children. We also hope that by God's grace all the hidden part of this vast island will enjoy the light of the Gospel. Truly, Mr. Editor, if Africa is ever evangelised it will be by her own sons. From the state and from what I study of the town at present, I can say with confidence that nothing can bring a degraded country to a state of civilisation but the Gospel of Christ. Christ's Gospel is bringing Fernando Po to a state of civilisation, especially its capital, Santa Ysabel, the seat of government, and the place where all business transactions are carried on. Allow me to lay an open question to the public. What do the public think will bring the inhabitants of the interior to Christianity? I, for my part, say that nothing but prayer, and I believe that God, who has brought the inhabitants of Madagascar to his fold, will surely bring them.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABYSSINIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have received the following, dated Gondai, Abyssinia, 23rd September, 1862, from a British resident in that country.

THE COMMERCIAL OUTLOOK.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Commercially and industrially speaking, the coast of Madagascar may be divided into five great divisions. The first is the long stretch of east coast from Antongil Bay to Fort Dauphin, forming almost a straight line. It contains not a single really good natural harbour, nor a decently navigable river of any length, and most of its towns are only approached by dangerous roadsteads. From its geographical position it will easily be understood that its foreign element are mostly Mauritians. The natural resources of this coast have been to a great extent exhausted, and the prospects now lie principally in sugar-planting. The Mauritians are naturally acquainted with this industry, and there is a great future before them. Coffee is also a profitable undertaking, but it must not be planted at a lower elevation than 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. Spices of almost every kind can also be cultivated auxiliary to the sugar plantations. The second division is that called the North-east Coast, being that part between Antongil Bay and Cape Amber. It contains two or three harbours, but not very good ones. The forests here are much larger than in any other part, and consequently the natural supplies of India-rubber and gum-copal are still plentiful. This is the most thinly populated part of the island, but exceedingly fertile. Probably in a few more years the natural resources will be exhausted, and foreign residents will then have recourse to agriculture, with better results perhaps than can be obtained on any other part of the East Coast. The third division of the Coast is the North-west, from Cape Amber to Cape St. Andrew, and the part coveted by France. This part contains lignite deposits and valuable woods, and is full of good harbours. Its foreign element consists chiefly of Indians and Muslims, and a few French Creoles. The fourth division is the West Coast, properly called—i.e., from Cape St. Andrew North to St. Augustine South. Full of good harbours and navigable rivers, it is probably the finest part of Madagascar. The foreigners there are mostly Americans and Englishmen, who carry on a trade with the Cape and Natal. The fifth part is the Southern portion, from St. Augustine to Fort Dauphin, about which nothing is really known.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how little is yet known of the vast commercial resources of this island, and of the number of industries that may be opened. The trade of the last few months has been characterised by a little more activity, but at best can only be said to be very slack. The coast merchants are still prevented from exporting such articles as would afford supplies to the French armies, or were prevented up to a very short time ago.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back.

The colonial version, though contemporaneous with the events, is not perfect; it is tainted with the hostility that existed in the armies of the colonial powers between metropolitan and colonial regiments. The officers of the latter did not hesitate to portray their campaigns in Africa in such a way as to make them look comparable to the battles waged in Europe by the former. 5\nThe second influence was nationalist. Operations for conquest were contemporaneous with reformist and nationalist activity in the towns. Even when they were taking place far from the towns, the townspeople eagerly followed their ups and downs and immediately used them for ideological ends.

Here the main trends of the nineteenth century were the training and increasing professionalism and subsequent introduction of European armaments to this infantry. In the widespread movement of peoples, such as followed the Mfecane or the collapse of the Old Oyo empire, sometimes a people in a scrubland area hitherto depending on cavalry moved into a more forested area where cavalry warfare was difficult, and this further encouraged the decline of cavalries. Some of the states in direct confrontation with European settlers, having a tradition of mounted riflemen, bred ponies for fast movement, organized importation of European arms and created new armies that for a while had the balance of power on their side. In much of the rest of Africa and especially the Sudan, where for centuries the cavalry had been the core and the elite of the armies, trained, professional foot soldiers armed with rifles rose to become the elite force.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law.

On Christmas-day Captain Glover crossed the Volta with 17,000 men, losing only one man and getting but five wounded in the passage. The news of this commencement of hostilities was announced on the 28th, and followed by ten days\' festivities and fetish observances. At daybreak each morning the women paraded the town for a couple of hours, with three streaks of white paint down their foreheads, and howled for their husbands. The shout was anything but musical. They then retired for a few hours, and came out in full numbers about ten a.m. Then indeed was there a sight worth seeing. Each absent warrior had a representative in the person of his wife, or of a female slave dressed in male attire. The canoe-man\'s wife came out with a paddle; the bushman\'s with a long knife, the carpenter\'s with a saw, and the chieftain\'s with a birch broom to denote authority. A dreadful-looking woman, with a paper cocked hat on her head, and a cat-o\'-nine tails in her hand, was pointed out to me as \'Captain Glover;\' another, slightly less dreadful, as \'Mr. Goldsworthy.\' Lieutenants Larcom and Moor, Captain Sartorius and Mr. Blissett, appeared amongst the number. It was informed by Mrs. Addo, the hotel-keeper, that her slaves were dressed to dance for the officers of the expedition, as it was unlucky not to have some person specially appointed to appeal to the fetish for you. The enormous array danced for hours through the town, shouting songs of war and prayers for the defeat of the Acoosas and all their other enemies, going through the motions of trampling down the foe and cutting their throats, and finally supplicating the fetish for the return of their husbands and masters. So excited were they, that the perspiration poured off them; but they never once ceased dancing and shouting; their enthusiasm lending a wild melody to their notes of war or prayer. They kept excellent time withal with the war drums beaten by old women and young girls. Some of the cries they uttered are not within the compass of a white man\'s voice, and bore more resemblance to those of wild beasts. Woe betide the unfortunate man found lurking in the town when this procession comes round; his shoulders would soon feel the weight of the cat, and the paddles, and other weapons. The women drive every man to the war, and are more effectual than any police in clearing the town of any loafers. After their day\'s work was over, they retired to Mrs. Addo\'s hotel, and disposed of two puncheons of rum by way of refreshment, and then home to their huts. For ten days this scene, so extraordinary to European eyes, was repeated, and nothing that I have yet beheld in Africa has given me so strong an idea of the physical, let alone the moral, power of the women of the country; as I very much doubt if many professed dancers would be able to sustain such exertions two days running.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NIGER COAST PROTECTORATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Allman, Principal Medical Officer of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, has done much to improve the sanitary condition of Old Calabar and of the Protectorate generally.

The Public Works Department has been most efficiently carried on. The Consulate-General has been rendered habitable, its foundations, which were rapidly giving way under the attacks of white ants and heavy rains, have been strengthened. Two handsome and commodious houses have been built, one as a residence and offices for the Treasurer and the Director of Customs, and the other as a mess-house and quarters for the officers of the Oil Rivers Irregular Force. Barracks for 300 men are in course of construction, and will shortly be ready for occupation. The whole of these buildings have been constructed at home and sent out; they are all erected on a hill some 200 feet above the river. This has entailed great labour, but the sanitary results obtained fully compensate for the extra trouble. A marina is in course of construction in front of the Native town of Old Calabar. This, by doing away with the foreshore of the river, always the dustbin of a Native riverside town, will act beneficially from a sanitary point. The roads have been improved and put in order.

The special train which conveyed the body from Paris arrived at seven o\'clock on Saturday morning, respectful crowds gathering at the various stations along the route to offer their salutations as the train passed. On arriving at Nice a deputation of the town officials received the mourners, who had travelled by the special train from Paris, and in their presence the coffin was placed in one of the waiting-rooms, which had been fitted up as a mortuary. The weather was wild, and rain descended in torrents. Minute guns were fired by the ships anchored at Villa Franca. Marines and parties of blue-jackets were landed, and with strong detachments of infantry of the line, foot Chasseurs, more Artillery, and a company of school-boys, drew up to form the escort and to pay military honours. Admiral Cranty and his Staff were present, and General Carre de Bellemare and a brilliant military Staff also attended. At nine o\'clock the gates of the station were thrown open, and the population were allowed to file past the coffin; and many hundreds availed themselves of the privilege. The interment took place at noon. Before eleven o\'clock the procession was formed, the body being followed by M. Gambetta\'s old nurse, the father of the deceased, his sister, and his uncle, as chief mourners. Representatives of many public institutions, the staff of the *Republique Française*, several Senators and Deputies, and the personal friends of the deceased followed in the procession. Three funeral orations were delivered—one by General de Carre de Bellemare, Commander of the 29th Division; the second by the Mayor, M. Borriglione; and the third by the Prefect, M. Lagrange de Langre. He said that in 1870 he received verbal instructions from M. Gambetta on leaving Tours to organize the service confided to him in the Auxiliary Army; and that his words were: ""Do not trouble yourself about anything which cannot be of service to the country. Appeal to the devotion of all for the salvation of the *patrie*. In a word, think of France constantly, of France, and of nothing but France."" The Prefect added, with great effect, ""And, gentlemen, if I could only evoke before you, not my personal souvenirs, but the great patriot himself, whose remains are contained in this coffin, with what thrilling accents would Gambetta exclaim, \'Act so that even my death may serve the cause to which I have devoted my life; forget all barren competitions which may prove so dangerous to France and the Republic!

This evil custom is but too well known of by the educated natives of Accra, men who think themselves better than the other classes in the town; and it is strange that these educated natives should have so long kept silence, and not said a single word in the public papers against the atrocious evil and fetish customs which disgrace their town and country. May I ask, do these scholars patronize civilization and colonization as Lagos and Sierra Leone did? I answer, they do not; because they will not point out or will not speak to the authorities or in the public papers of the great obstacle (foolish heathenish customs, custom for deaths, fetish dancing in public streets, &c.), which prevents the progress of the inhabitants in civilization. If the educated natives do really know what civilization and colonization are, they should help the authorities to root up heathenish and foolish customs, the only canker which destroys the promising tree.\n\nThere are certain fetish men and women at Accra whose constant duty from time to time, and up to the present date, is to peep into every individual house and amongst every individual family for women who departed this life in the struggle of childbirth. As soon as these fetish men see or hear of the event they lose no time, but hasten into the house at night about twelve o\'clock and demand the remains, and carry them into an open field, and there cast the body, without burying it, for the wild beasts to eat. Is not such a custom an atrocious thing? Is it not a crime that deserves heavy punishment? After these wretched and barbarous fetish men and women have mercilessly performed this so-called duty, they call on the relatives of the deceased for all the property which pertained to her, whatever it may be, and convey it to the house of the head fetish man. Having done so, the fetish men and women bring fetish water, as they call it, in a wooden bowl, with certain kind of leaves, into the house of the deceased woman, and sprinkle the household and the bereaved husband, and the priest pronounces them ""unclean."" By this word ""unclean"" the whole of Accra consider this individual family as people who are accursed, for a space of three successive weeks. During these weeks the accursed families, as well as the husband of the deceased woman, are not allowed to go out; neither are they allowed to salute anyone; they do not go into any house, neither do any of their kinsmen or kinswomen go to them.

Unfortunately, owing to obstructions placed in the way by the said King, we were unable to procure carriers and had to wait several days at Gwatto. Mr. Blair, as perhaps you will remember, fell ill, and the visit had to be abandoned, and we returned to the river. About two years later, accompanied by Mr. Bey, of the firm of Bey & Rimmer, of Hamburg, and Mr. H. Farquhar, then agent for Messrs. A. Miller Bros. & Co., I visited Benin city. We took our own carriers, so were in no way dependent upon the King. Just outside the city we had to pass through a common about a mile long by about 200 yards wide. In this place we found a number of dead bodies quite close to the footpath. They had evidently died a violent death, as their heads were, in some cases, severed from their bodies, and in others the skulls were smashed in. We did not linger to examine many, as the stench was overpowering; in fact, even the Natives had to put cloths to their noses while passing through. A little further on we came across the body of a woman crucified and placed upon sticks about fifteen feet from the ground. Upon inquiring the meaning of this we were told that it was usual to crucify a virgin in time of drought, and an old woman when they had too much rain. These are facts that can be verified, as Dr. Hanley visited the city some years after and photographed some of these sights and had them published in one of the London illustrated papers. A little further on we saw a sort of platform slightly inclined and fixed between trees and about twenty feet from the ground. Upon this were quite a number of bodies and skeletons in all stages of decomposition. This, I believe, was also photographed and published by Dr. Hanley. During our stay (three days) in the city we had several messages, supposed to come from the King, to the effect that as the chiefs were out killing we were on no account to allow our black carriers outside the compound after dark, and strongly advised us, the whitemen, to remain in also, it being the custom that promotion from rank to rank is attained by killing a certain number of men. This is accomplished by way-laying after dark. It is also the custom for the King to kill yearly a large number of slaves to celebrate the anniversary of his father\'s death.

In some of the rural districts they are made of bamboo, rattles being woven between the upright posts, which are then plastered over with clay, which becomes, when dry, remarkably hard. The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold. From inquiries I have made, I find that twenty may be safely reckoned the average number of tenants living under one roof in the two-storied houses in Cape Coast, and it often happens that sober, decent people dwell in one apartment, and a drunken man in the next, for I regret to say that drunkenness is a wide-spread vice among the natives—a circumstance chiefly dependent upon the cheapness of the spirits imported from the United States, Holland, and the Brazils.""\n\nAnd again:—\n\n""The mass of the inhabitants bury their dead in the basement floor of their houses—a practice not confined to the pagan part of the population, but also practised by many respectable and wealthy families. This hurtful custom cannot be too soon discontinued. It is not done by the natives of the interior, but by all accounts it has been an ancient custom in the coast towns. When the deceased is wealthy, valuable articles, as gold ornaments, gold dust, aggrey beads, are placed in the coffin, and the body is sprinkled with gold dust. These tombs in this way become family banks, and in the time of trouble the gold so deposited is applied to meet pressing claims or other family purposes. The practice of depositing articles of value with the dead is of very ancient origin, for King David had large treasure placed in his tomb by King Solomon.""', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE LATE DR.

He fully merited that esteem. As a sincere and attached friend of many years, we deeply deplore his loss. No man has more successfully vindicated the just claim of the African race to mental equality with the more favoured portions of mankind. The son of liberated Africans—that is, of Africans who had been rescued from on board slave-ships by cruisers of Her Majesty's Navy—he had the disadvantage of being of the first generation of his family in the ranks of civilization. He had none of the advantages possessed by Europeans of hereditary culture. What he effected was all his own—all the fruit of his own labour, utilizing the elements placed at his disposal by the Christian philanthropy of Great Britain. The Church Missionary Society may record his name with pride as among the fruit of their persistent labours in West Africa; and Her Majesty's Government had certainly no cause to regret having taken him into the medical ranks of the Army, in which he attained to the high position of Surgeon-Major, and from which he retired last year, after a full period of service, but without receiving the decoration of St. Michael and St. George, which could only have been withheld because he was an African.

This was a custom held in honour of a man who had died several months ago, leaving much property to his relatives. In gratitude for this, they had worn mourning for the deceased for a long time, and now they appeared in chalk and white raiment as a formal sign that the period of mourning was at an end. Part of this ceremony consisted in carrying a live child in a coffin. After all this, they went down to the beach and bathed. Abstinence from bathing on alternate days is one of the mourning customs here, and the women now bathed to show that the time of abstinence was over. It may sound heartless to find food for amusement in the funeral customs of people, but a man cannot be expected to feel more affected than the mourners themselves, and many of the girls who parade the streets in procession, with much howling and clapping their hands, break into a smile if they catch the eye of a white man as they pass.

Additionally, they note that the Spanish Governor enforced restrictions on Protestant activities, such as closing schools and prohibiting services, while the Spanish Government expressed regret for not including Fernando Po in a decree granting religious freedom to other colonies.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

In opposition to the concept of nidhâm, reorganization of their army, bureaucracy and daily life, they set up the notion of islah, personal moral and religious renewal. This was the movement called salafism (Muslim fundamentalism).$^{46}$ The urban man-inthe-street thought back with nostalgia to the good old days when food and goods were cheap, and when personal needs and the Makhzen\'s requirements were limited.

The people\'s xenophobia, the $^{ <}$ulamä""s salafism and the Makhzen\'s conservatism were expressions of their experience: the decadence of their earlier society when confronted with nineteenth-century liberal capitalism.

They also wanted to buy luxury goods such as cloth and alcohol and to expand their exports, mainly cattle and rice, to Mauritius and RØunion in order to pay for the necessary imports. Queen Ranavalona therefore wanted to find a modus vivendi with the Europeans, to enable her country to develop without the fear of European antagonism and war. In pursuit of this policy, she and her advisers decided in 1836 to send an embassy to France and England and to negotiate fresh treaties of friendship and commerce, based on respect for Malagasy culture and independence and to secure recognition for Ranavalona I as Queen of Madagascar.$^{29}$ The Malagasy embassy - the first ever to be sent to Europe - consisted of six officers and two secretaries and was led by Andriantsitchaina.$^{30}$ Their stay in Paris was uneventful and they then crossed the Channel to London.

Our esteemed friend, Mr. Chamerovzow (for whom we made an appeal last month, which we now renew, and desire to press on the particular attention of Africans), being in Madrid, and believing, as we did, that the prohibition of worship by his Excellency the Governor of Fernando Po was not in conformity with the spirit and intentions of the present Spanish Government, we entreated him to render a new service to Africans by applying to that Government for a decree or order to the Governor of Fernando Po, to allow entire freedom of religious worship. Our friend entered, as we knew he would, with ardour into our views, and urged upon the Minister for the Colonies the consideration of the hardship under which the Protestant Christians of Fernando Po now laboured in being prohibited the exercise of public worship, soliciting also the decree or order above mentioned. The Minister for the Colonies expressed his deep regret that by an oversight Fernando Po was not included in the decree which gave this freedom of worship to Cuba, Porto Rico, &c., and stated that a decree was in preparation, which would be promulgated after the necessary formalities, for regulating that and other matters in Fernando Po. Our friend Mr. Chamerovzow stated, in continuation, that those necessary formalities might, however, occupy several months; and recommended some petitions from England to the Spanish Government on the subject. On consideration, however, it appeared to us that the more efficient course would be to move the British Government in the affair, and obtain an application from this Government, through the Ambassador at Madrid to the Spanish Government, in favour of a speedy bestowal of this boon of freedom of public worship of the Africans and others at Fernando Po. We are now pursuing this course, and hope it will lead to a speedy realisation of the desires of the Protestant Christians in the island. We always considered the British Government to have been greatly in fault in not having obtained for them the promise of this freedom of worship when they gave up the island to the Spanish Government; and are further of opinion that the fact of many of the Protestant Christians in Fernando Po having been made such under the labours of British ministers of the Gospel when the island was under our rule will give additional force to any application that may be made by the Earl of Clarendon, through Mr. Layard, to the Spanish Government on the subject.

By some strange oversight when the island was restored to Spain there was no promise asked that this freedom of worship should be continued to the people.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages.

We say justification, because ""Fair-play"" does not in his letter excuse the Governor, but accuses all those who have complained of the treatment received from him. Although nothing can excuse in our eyes, at this period of the nineteenth century, the oppressive religious bigotry, which, however it may be defended by Spanish law, and practised in Spain, where ninety-nine out of a hundred of the population are truly or nominally of the Roman Catholic faith, is most inapplicable in an island on the West Coast of Africa, where freedom of worship prevailed under British rule, we must at least confess that ""Fair-play"" has, with regard to other matters, so carried the war into the enemy\'s camp, that there is matter in his statements challenging and justly demanding further inquiry.

I remember some of his visits to the Primitive Methodist Day School at the early part of 1877. One day he asked me whether the school children could read the Spanish reading book as well as they were reading the English. The next day his Excellency sent a policeman to the school to know from me the number of children; the third day he wrote to the Superintendent Missionary, demanding the names of all the school children; after which he made the parents to understand that they would be subject to imprisonment or fine if any of their children attended the English School and did not attend the Spanish School as well; and before the close of that year, 1877, his Excellency closed the school. Shortly after he closed the Sabbath School also. One afternoon he sent a policeman to ring a bell round the town, calling the people\'s attention to a notice which he ordered to be put in the ""Plaza,"" prohibiting the evening services of the Primitive Methodist Church. He generally called it ""caja"" (meaning a box). The bell calling people to church was to hold its tongue.\n\nTwo Boobee men died last year, before I left Fernando Po, for want of a bridge to cross the stream, the old one having been broken. His Excellency, instead of making another bridge, took the Government Krooboys to the front of the Mission premises, and ordered the pulling down of all the paling fences—more to do evil than good. His Excellency did not care about his law books; he would tell you that, according to Book xii., title 23, law 3, this crime is to be punished by such and such and such, but ""I, as the Governor,"" would have it so and so.\n\nNot to trespass too much on your valuable space, I must be brief, but say we have had worthy and honoured Governors before in Fernando Po, such as His Excellency Don Ignacio, and others. His Excellency Don Ignacio did not persecute Protestants, but ruled to the satisfaction of both Roman Catholics and Protestants, and for the advancement of the island. He respected both schools, and was regardful of the laws of the Government which he had the honour to represent; so that when his time was finished it was desired that he should not go, because there was peace and prosperity in the island.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1879#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tyranny in Fernando Po', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—Doubtless there are abuses in the administration of the British settlements on this coast, and your columns give proof that there are complaints to be heard and evils to be remedied, but in no settlements belonging to any other nation is there the like individual and collective freedom, the same faithful discharge of duty, the same equality of all before the law, or the same personal rights, privileges, and liberty of conscience. If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Government Abuses at Fernando Po', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—It is greatly to be deplored that the Spanish Government—who in helping up their establishments at this place, thereby manifest a desire to continue in occupation of one of the most fertile and lovely spots in the world—should show so little regard for the liberties and well-being of its inhabitants, or for the development of its material resources, as to send out men utterly unacquainted with the art of liberal government, and altogether devoid of the necessary knowledge or qualifications for insuring the steady, quiet, prosperous advancement of commerce and agriculture—so eagerly fostered by, and so essential to, all communities desirous of advancement in all that men hold valuable and worth living for. Here we have commerce at its lowest ebb, agriculture without protection, religion and all material interests harassed and worried by vexatious edicts; men\'s liberties outraged, acts of violence and oppression following one after another, and people feeling themselves and their property altogether at the mercy of absolute, irresponsible, and evil-disposed men, of whom no account will probably be required by their masters, even if they should by chance ever know of what has been done. Without any reason that is known the Governor lately published the following edict: ""Be it known to the public from date that no meeting is to take place after sunset until its rising next morning, and the Government thinks fit to prohibit the meetings of the English Methodists between the hours of seven and eight o\'clock on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings.—By command of the Governor of this Colony, Sept. 19, 1878, Alejandro Arias Salgado."" The Governor had evidently received no good from his attendance at the four meetings immediately preceding the publication of his latest order. Carefully note the wording of this new law. Can anything be more peremptory or absolute, or more clearly show how desirous this man is to curtail the liberties and privileges of at least the Protestant portion of the public, which you know to be the bulk of the population of Santa Isabella? It is by command of the Governor. He does not even make the order in the name of his King; the King himself could not have been more peremptory. The man who has done this has also sent his men to forcibly take the keys of a man\'s safe and opening it, pay thereout a fine which he had inflicted. The same man also sent his people to go into a store and seize all the medicines in it (some of them having been ordered by a Government doctor and refused acceptance of), fining the owner of the store above 40l. for dealing in medicines, although they have been sold by all the stores ever since Europeans came to the island, and are a great boon to the public; but, ""I,"" the Governor, will not have it, and by virtue of the extraordinary discretionary powers with which ""I"" am entrusted, ""I"" seize and fine, and imprison, and transport. A mighty man is he (as the songs says of the blacksmith) in Fernando Po. But who is this mighty man, more powerful in his little sphere than King, or Emperor, or Czar? Outside this little island a very insignificant member of the ""great unknown"" These Governors come and go like comets, making a great stew and fuss whilst they last, and then disappear, never more to be heard of. Their reign is short and that is the only comfort we have when we get a bad one. But they are not all bad. We have had many good Governors, both military and naval, whose names are remembered with love and deep regard; but there were others whose base and evil dispositions have earned for them the maledictions of this most docile and tractable race of men. The system, however, of a two years\' governorship is a bad one. If we get a good earnest, sensible, far-seeing man, he is followed probably by one who is lazy, incapable, self-seeking and vain, with the result that he undoes all the good his predecessor has done. They are not long enough in office to take any real interest in their work. Little care have they for Fernando Po, so long as they draw their double pay, and turn their back on it when their term is ended; it is to the home Government that we must look for a remedy for these evils, which will some time become unendurable and end in violence. The Government has only to look at Cuba to see what official intolerance and disregard for the liberties of the people have done. A civil Governor, and one who knows something of the art of governing, as well as of the means best calculated to encourage agriculture and commerce, one with broad and liberal views of men and things in general, and who is willing to receive sound advice from those he has to govern—is the man wanted here; and he should be appointed for a term of five years. Compare the prosperous condition of the British Colonies along this Coast with the present condition of things here, and then let the Government ask what is the cause of it. The reason is not far to seek, in spite of the disadvantages of heavy duties levied in the British Colonies; and we shall have no improvement until the property and rights of the people here are made more secure from outrage, and a greater regard is shown for their convictions and privileges. As to the present Governor, it is suggested that those who have suffered through his injustice should band together and appeal for redress—legal redress—through the courts-of-law in Spain. A few hundred pounds would be well spent in bringing prominently before the Spanish public the doings of their irresponsible servants here, and would undoubtedly obtain the attention of the Spanish Government thereto.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Endeavour to Obtain Freedom of Worship in Fernando Po', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In an editorial last month we stated what we had caused to be done in Madrid for obtaining freedom of worship at Fernando Po; and also that we had followed this up by an application to the right honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, praying him to use his good offices with the Spanish Government accomplishing that desirable object.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism. For the Negroes in particular the theory postulated a degree of cultural barrenness which made it necessary and possible to explain their history and social evolution in terms of the Hamitic impact.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word. The Arabic dimension was unique in its own right, an ambivalent face of expansionism which none the less left strong cultural impressions on the landscape.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

And most especially when that literary advantage is fostered in the proselytizing service of the alien culture. The experience of Islam was therefore different only in quality, not in results from the Euro-Christian incursion into the culture of the indigenous peoples. The event of two literacies from historically opposing cultures meeting on a 'passive' terrain provokes intensified devices from both groups, and more especially from the first arrival which sees its carefully nurtured field invested, literally on the eve of harvest. Both factions of course ignore, or are prepared to deny, the previous existence of authentic values of the contested ground, conveniently presuming it a cultural vacuum. The syncretic tolerance of African cultural systems naturally lent credence to this presumption and, ironically, of the two contestants, it was the culture which itself displayed some of this syncretic possibility - the Islamic which lost the great element of its own orthodoxy - including the 'orthodoxies' of later schisms - in the seemingly accommodative passivity of the indigenous people."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': 'Finally, there was the question of differing African responses to foreign influences.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J.

If there were a real belief that all powers had been committed unto Christ by the Father; that his rule is not a shadowy unreality, but the constant exercise of an active sovereignty; that all the blessings promised for true and faithful service, for pure obedience, for holy zeal and ardour, for loving exertion to promote the spread of his Truth, to bring to human ears the glad tidings of his salvation, and with mild and gentle firmness to inculcate the honour and respect due to his precepts and commands, are sure—would such have been the Sunday Observance Bill passed by a House of Lords; would such have been the language in a motion and its advocacy, for placing the Bible in the schools of India; would ""grants in aid"" for preaching the everlasting Gospel have been spoken of as ""full of peril to the Government,"" by one who came forward ostensibly as an advocate for the cause of Christ? What sort of a national Christianity is that where the nation in its Government is supposed to be something altogether distinct and apart from the individual Christian elements of which the nation is composed; where it is established as a rule that the spread of eternal truth, the proclamation of the one great and only salvation, through Christ the Universal King, appertains solely to individual efforts, but is a concern with which the Government should not in any way interfere for promoting it? A nation cannot be Christian in its components, and indifferent to the cause and honour, and glory and service of Christ in its aggregate. If there be a predominating practical belief in the one, there will be a similar belief exhibited by the other. If a Government proclaims that all the nation desires is power, extended possession, and wealth—the former, in fact, merely for the augmentation of the latter; that if it be called upon to choose between the spread of Christianity by its efforts, not of force, but of teaching and encouragement, and the exercise of rule and increase of wealth alone, thereby making virtual abnegation of its Christianity, it will pronounce for the latter, what sort of predominating practical belief can there be among the individual elements of which the nation, having such a Government, of its own election, is composed? Certainly not a practical belief in God and Christ. It looks much more like a practical belief in Satan. Does it not assert that he has power to overthrow the empire of those who declare for the honour and glory of Christ, and strive to extend his dominion among the hearts of men—that he is the sole bestower of wealth and rule—that if he is too much interfered with in his debasing and demoralising sway—that if an open Christian war be waged against him to bring within the glorious gates of eternal life the souls he is conducting to perdition, he may be angry, and depose those who dare to interfere with him? What is this but a reproduction of the old nation-destroying idolatry of the Jews, carried on simultaneously with the professed worship of Jehovah; the idolatry of the heart, that regards wealth as the chief good and sets up Mammon as supreme lord of its desires—makes him the arbiter of individual and national destinies—bows down before his image enshrined within, offers him the tribute due to God, does homage to him for the world and the glory thereof, and dares to present to the great Eternal One, the Sovereign Lord and his Christ, the refuse of its obedience, a little paltry instalment of what is due to Him; making him subservient and inferior, and daring presumptuously to hope that such insulting acknowledgment will satisfy Him, and procure from Him all the blessings it is in His power to bestow? I hold the introduction of such a Bill and such a motion in one and the same session of Parliament, following within a few years the removal of the name of Christ in order that a few wealthy Jews might enter Parliament, to have been an open and declared assertion of the superior claims of the mighty deluder of the nations, under the mask of professed Christianity. It was an awful evidence of the true state of the national heart; that there was no real practical belief in the universal sovereignty of God and Christ; that there was a belief that these have at most but a share in the dispensation of this world\'s glory and honours, and not the principal share; that the great truths of Divine revelation obtain but very little credence, and exercise, therefore, but a very inferior operative power; while he who taunted the Saviour with his hunger, and bade Him make bread out of the stones on the rock-strewn desert; he who showed Him at a glance all the kingdoms of the earth, and promised all their wealth, their cruel glory, and sensual delights in return for worship, employs successfully with professed Christians the weapons which the great Captain of Salvation showed them how to resist and to defy.'}, {'id': 4918, 'article_title': 'The Wholesale Murders in Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'The Wholesale Murders in Lagos', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-18', 'issue_date': '01_09_1884', 'content': 'In our last number, under the heading of ""Lagos News,"" we mentioned that one Adeoshun had been arrested, charged with the murder, under most revolting circumstances, of many of the women residents of the town.

When the last advices left Lagos, Adeoshun was undergoing a police examination, and so great was the excitement in the place, and particularly among the female portion of the inhabitants, that a force of Houssas had to be specially in attendance at the police-court to protect the accused from the violence of the mob, which numbered some 3,000 people. The first charge against Adeoshun is that of the murder of Mrs. Selina Cole. This lady disappeared very mysteriously some time since, and it was thought that she had been decoyed outside the protectorate and sold into slavery—a circumstance which is stated in the despatch to be not of very unfrequent occurrence. Subsequently the husband of the missing woman became aware that certain property which belonged to his wife was in the possession of Adeoshun. A search warrant being obtained, goods to the value of some £160 were found on the premises of the accused, all of which were said to belong to Mrs. Cole. The matter having been taken up by Inspector Willoughby, of the Houssa police, a bush near the town was searched, resulting in the discovery of four skeletons, and subsequently eight more. The remains of Mrs. Cole were among the number. It is said that the accused, by the aid of his charms, was believed by the females of the colony to be able to bring them wealth. From Mrs. Cole alone we learn that Adeoshun obtained some £500 prior to her disappearance. It is stated that the prisoner induced his victims to meet him in a lonely part of Ikoyi (near where the bodies were found) and there forced them to kneel down with their eyes blindfolded. A live fowl was then put in each hand of the victims, and while in this position it is believed they were despatched by the aid of some heavy weapon.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND HER EVANGELIZATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A friend of Africa would naturally be guided by the practical result of the religious and other means adopted for her elevation in the social scale, and her enjoyment of those advantages which Christianity alone possesses.

A general view would embrace every particular view, and the friend of Africa in general, would be found the friend of Africa in particular.\n\nI have been much struck with the similarity of feature presented by Africa in general. Without the intervention of the white man, ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, have prevailed, together with a nomadic mode of life one step only removed from that of the brute beasts around. With ignorance there have been found selfishness and cruelty, and regard for human life has been scarcely perceptible anywhere. With the white man's knowledge came also the white man's sins; and as with individuals men will be found to imitate the bad example rather than the good, so has it been with Africa in general, since only in the parts as yet unvisited by the white man is the black man found in his native simplicity and ignorance; whilst in all other parts he has acquired cunning, deceit, and mistrust.\n\nThe means originally adopted for the improvement (if improvement it could be called) of newly-discovered Africa had presently and ultimately in view gain. The possessions of the black man were coveted and craftily obtained; the black man's body even was made the subject of barter and exchange, with the object of his working for the white man's use, as cattle bought in market overt. No wonder, then, that the influence of the white man over the black was evil instead of good; and the improvement of Africa had subsequently to be effected through the removal of that mistrust and deceit which the white man's conduct had produced. Trade can be legitimate as well as beneficial. Had this been practically shown in Africa, who can calculate the enormous benefit which the white man's influence in Africa would, ere this, have brought. Some men's sins go before to judgment, and some they follow after. Transgressors go not without the punishment due to their offence, but those who follow them have the effect of their transgressions to overcome, ere they can be placed in the position they occupied before such offence was committed. Other means were doubtlessly adopted, and ultimately Christianity was brought to bear only where all these means had failed. No wonder, then, that religion was, to the black man, invested with the garment of a trade, and this investment proved against the white man, in return, the greatest hindrance to progress and improvement."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony.

It is now nearly twelve months since Lagos was pointed out to us, as at one and the same time carrying on an extensive slave-trade, and recruiting the ranks of domestic slavery within the colony; unchecked, though we never can admit that it could have been unobserved, by the British authorities there; and until then not denounced, or publicly rebuked, either by Christian missionaries or the admitted and acknowledged members of their respective churches. The European missionaries, and the native pastors and teachers, all, we are bound to presume, deeply imbued with the principles and precepts inculcated by Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount, are not few in number; while the communicants in the churches may be counted by hundreds. How is it to be accounted for, that of this not inconsiderable body of British officials and missionaries, and native pastors, teachers, and communicants, not one, until our correspondent addressed us on the subject,—not one, we say, entered the lists against what they know to be as abominable in the eyes of British law, as it is repugnant to the spirit of that Christianity which they all profess? We can only account for it by what seems to be the fact, that as we have stated, the whole atmosphere of Africa is so tainted by the spirit of the slave-trade and of slavery, that to inhale it produces a moral and spiritual torpor, from which only an exceptionally vigorous and sensitive conscience can free itself. Under such circumstances, an independent and uncompromising public Press is manifestly a vital necessity for Africa, if the hope is to be indulged of her ever being reclaimed from that abyss of misery and degradation, of moral filth and spiritual loathsomeness into which she has been plunged, by the long-continued dominion within her of the most debasing superstitions and vices that ever fettered humanity. Regard it as they may in the vitiated atmosphere they breathe on the African Coast, and familiarized as they are with the abominable evil, so as to be perhaps unconscious of its ruinous tendencies, our African readers may rest assured that the material progress which is so important for them as regards their trading operations, depends in a very great degree on the extent to which freedom shall replace slavery. These readers of ours, we are told, comprise every African on the West Coast who has any pretension whatever to be classed as an educated man. We call upon them all to lay this truth seriously to heart. If they desire the development of the resources of the countries that supply the produce in which they trade, they should use all their influence, individually and collectively, against those gigantic paralyzers of human energies for purposes of good, the slave-trade and slavery. Their eye should not pity, their heart should not spare, any one among themselves whose covetousness, or other vile and debasing lusts, may lead him to dishonour the education that has been bestowed upon him, by buying or selling his fellow-creatures. The letters from Lagos and Cape Coast, to which we gave insertion in our August number, show, unhappily, how very necessary it is that we place these truths clearly and constantly before them, so long as God may grant us the energy and means to do so. The Hydra of African slavery must be killed. We have pledged ourselves to a war of extermination against it. Every educated man and woman on the West Coast ought to be active and energetic soldiers in our army. Thanks especially to the exertions of our noble missionary societies, there is now no inconsiderable number of educated women on the Coast; women, Christians too we hope in reality, as well as in profession, in addition to being educated. This great question of the total disappearance of slavery from among them; of that horribly debasing, degrading institution, under which members of their own sex may be purchased—victims in body and soul—ministers to lust and to every brutal passion, for a few pounds sterling, or dollars, or pieces of cloth, or bags of cowries—this question, we repeat, touches them nearly. The position that they and their educated female children may occupy; the greater or less consideration with which they will be regarded and treated, depends in no small degree, on the continuance or annihilation of female domestic slavery. They must—it is inevitable—they must be included, more or less, in the degradation that falls upon their human sisters. We call upon them to regard it as an accursed thing; as striking at the very root of that elevation of themselves in the community, to which their sex has attained in the Christian countries of Europe. We call upon them to look at it as the forbidden spoil in the tent of Achan, bringing a curse upon the whole community to which the culprit belongs. It is quite time that the educated women in Africa, particularly in the British settlements, where they are under the protection of British laws, should make their purifying influence felt in this vital matter. It is for them to cast a halo of purity and of Christian love around; to show in practice as in word, that they love their poorer sisters as themselves. It is only thus that there can be any hope of the purification of African society; any hope of that material as well as Christian advancement, which can alone raise Africa from the degraded position it holds in European opinion; a position owing in no small degree to that abominable slave-trade and slavery, which we call upon them to use their utmost efforts to eradicate.', 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OIL RIVERS, AND WEST AFRICAN CIVILIZATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'hope of preserving their monopolies, while they may rest assured that persecution of Christian converts will lead, sooner or later, to their own destruction.\n\n---', 'last_edit_date': '1877-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1877#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In all the coast region between the Gambia and the Cameroons the most extravagant development of tropical vegetation is seen.

With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

They criticize the government's neutrality between Christian missionary work and traditional practices, arguing that such neutrality hinders the social welfare of the natives and the progress of Christianity.

The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected.

He wanted to know the conditions for protection and he emphasized that the relationship would be guided by 'Christian morality'. Furthermore, his rival brother, Kgamane, had settled in the Transvaal with his followers and was fighting with the Boers in the hope of gaining the Ngwato throne (see Fig. 9.1).\nThe British were bitterly divided over Bechuanaland.

All the Africans living in the reserves were placed under chiefs and headmen, and where the latter did not exist, new ones were created.

To finance his administration, Shepstone imposed a hut tax collectable in cash or cattle (which could be sold to the white farmers for cash). His administration was consistently attacked by the white settlers because, they argued, it made the Africans economically self-sufficient and therefore prevented them from becoming labourers on the farms and plantations. But Shepstone did not lock up the Africans in locations because he loved them. Rather, he clearly saw that coercive measures to produce labourers would only result in resistance, which the comparatively weak Natal colonial administration could not possibly cope with. The settlers who criticized him seem to have ignored the contribution of Africans to the profits of large landowners who subsisted on the rentals of over half the black population living as squatters on white farms, and to the colony's revenues in the form of the hut tax. In fact what Shepstone had done was to produce a cheap administration that afforded the white colonial society opportunities to exploit both the Africans and their natural resources in comparative peace and security. 12 The white society was mostly of British origin. After the drain by Boer emigration the white population increased steadily as a result of immigration by British subjects escaping from the social problems accompanying the economic crisis of 1847-51. Financed by speculators, some 5000 white settlers left Britain for Natal in this period. By 1870 the whites in Natal numbered 18000. The increase in the number of white settlers went hand in hand with constitutional changes. In 1856 Natal was made a separate colony and granted a Legislative Council. The franchise was made colour-blind, so that male British subjects owning at the minimum immovable property worth £50 or renting property worth £50 at an annual rate of £10 could vote.

Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious.

They dreaded being attacked again by the Asante and were determined to contribute to their own defence, but they disapproved of the flabby attitude of the Dutch to Kumasi and its coastal ally, Elmina. They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous.

Because there alone in Africa we have absolute power over it; because there alone in Africa we are responsible for it; because there alone in Africa it is a reproach to this Christian nation—a reproach that we hope it will not consent any longer to endure. We have shown what Natal is—that it is the colony of a Christian nation, possessing a Christian population of upwards of 15,000 souls—a colony into which Christian emigrants from Great Britain are entering in a continuous, though not very copious stream—a colony into which a refugee Kafir population now numbering 180,000 has been admitted—a colony in which, notwithstanding the presence of this numerous African people, Coolies are obliged to be imported from India to perform the necessary work of the plantations. It is among those Kafirs that polygamy, as an institution belonging to them before they came into the colony, has been not only tolerated, but protected in the colony, to its manifest prejudice and loss, both in a material and moral point of view. For polygamy among those Kafirs, as in all parts of native Africa, is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. We have been told of late by some of our hasty African travellers, in excuse of the slave-trade, that a great number of the victims carried from Africa in the loathsome slave ships are criminals; and we have heard a sort of lament that where the slave-trade has happily been suppressed, the virtuous communities in question, as at Brass, Bonny, Calabar, &c., have no way of getting rid of their criminals. Well, these so-called criminals are so, if so at all, mostly through the operation of polygamy. The chiefs and head men monopolise all the women—they make of them their wives and slaves—and the lower classes of the population and male slaves are left unprovided with wives. This leads to aggressions on their part upon the coveted live property of their superiors, which becomes particeps criminis. It would be difficult to convey to our readers any adequate idea of the enormous evils resulting from that abominable institution of polygamy. In Dahomey, for example, where the sovereign power is absolute, every female child born in the country, or captured in the predatory expeditions, is the property of the king. Every man in the realm, from the highest to the lowest, receives his wife from the king, either as a gift or by purchase. No man can thus obtain a wife until he has become possessor of a certain sum, which being brought to court during the Customs, he receives a wife of some sort in exchange. In order to prevent the too great multiplication of criminals, which could not fail otherwise to take place, where the bulk of the population are precluded from the possession of wives, a number of women are set aside arbitrarily by the king as the common property of the people at large, upon very easy conditions for the latter. Ashantee is as Dahomey in this abomination. And everywhere else in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. All the hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who loathed some old polygamist for whom they were destined, and dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent. We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trustee of these lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change.

The parents are only too willing to receive them back, provided there be not any return demanded of the cattle that had been paid for them. But in a British colony—especially where, as in Natal, the natives are refugees, who have fled from otherwise certain destruction, and found refuge there—this task ought not to have devolved upon the missionaries; the evil ought long since to have been arrested by the Government. It is most disgraceful that it has not been so arrested. The colonists would certainly have effected this, if they could have obtained the consent of the superior authorities in Downing-street.

The worst social vices and most pernicious customs—vices and customs antagonistic with civilization and material progress—have been perpetuated among them. And of these one that may be emphatically called the second, if not the first monster curse of native Africa, polygamy, stands prominently forward, outraging the moral sense of the Christian European community in the colony, and occasionally enacting deeds of horror that elicit a momentary expression of general indignation. What? In a British colony? In the colony of a Christian nation? Yes, Polygamy is there sanctioned by law—among the natives. Polygamy there ties up the reluctant, protesting, disobedient girl who presumes to have affections, and refuses to become the fifth or sixth domestic slave, under name of wife, of some hoary polygamist, and roasts her to death at a slow fire! Are we not right, then, in saying boldly and firmly that the time has come when this foul blot upon a British colony shall be prevented from becoming of a deeper dye, and shall come under the process of gradual obliteration? Shall we not be upheld in saying this? We feel no doubt that we shall be supported by a Christian people in the onslaught we are determined to make against this enormity.

These tracts were termed Kafir locations. They were withdrawn altogether from the list of lands of the colony for sale to European immigrants; and the Kafirs were massed upon them. This was error number one, and a greater error could scarcely have been committed. We judge by its fruits, and amongst its fruits must be numbered all those other regulations concerning these people which treated them and recognised them as communities within a community. All that was thought of seemed to be, how to manage these people in the easiest way. Moral principle, moral obligation and duty, to say nothing of Christian ones, were put out of sight altogether. If we were inclined to use harsh language, we should say that it seems to have been determined by the Government that it was not at all desirable to bring these poor victims of heathen delusions and abominations within the pale of Christian civilization. Government set to work to refetter them within a Christian colony by as many of their old heathen bonds as could possibly be applied. Massed in Kafir locations, they were encouraged and allowed to place themselves under the immediate rule of native chiefs; they were made amenable among themselves to Kafir laws and customs, however much at variance these might be with the principles of a Christian State. The magistracy of the Christian State were even ordered to comply with the demands of Kafir law, however repugnant it might be with Christian principle and civilised practice, by delivering up to these new Kafir authorities such of their people as might seek to withdraw themselves from the cruel heathen tyranny to which they were thus relegated within the colony by a Government whose first object, after giving these poor creatures a safe asylum, should have been to introduce them as rapidly as possible to that larger moral freedom which is derived from Christian precept and belief.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DR.

This at least is not a theological question, and does not in any way rest upon the credibility of the Pentateuch. It is an eminently practical question, and, with reference to the Africans (among whom it is an institution about as respectable as that the ostentatious display of which our magistrates are praiseworthily endeavouring to suppress in Regent-street), is so connected with the subject of their civilization, that, independently of those sentiments regarding it which we entertain in common with the great body of Christians, we have always felt it to be one of the greatest importance.\n\nDr. Colenso has been reading at a meeting of the Anthropological Society a long paper on ""Missionary Efforts among Savages,"" as a sort of reply to one on the same subject previously read by that assailant of missions, Mr. Winwood Reade, who gathered up his wonderful stores of knowledge during a five months\' flying trip along the West Coast of Africa. We leave to the gentlemen of our missionary societies the appreciation of the Doctor\'s defence of Christian missions. He says, in effect, that the efforts of missionaries among savages have been a great blessing to them; but, as to the preaching of Christianity among them being necessary to their salvation, it is all humbug. It is, the Bishop says, ""a horrible delusion,"" that this is at all necessary to their eternal salvation! After this we are more and more at a loss to conceive why the Bishop belongs in any way to a preaching Christian Church. We do not want bishops and clergy for mere secular, industrial, and moral education. And if Christianity is not necessary to salvation in Africa, neither can it be necessary in England. But what we have more especially to deal with is the Bishop\'s defence of polygamy among the natives. And, as we are not less diametrically opposed to him as regards this ""native custom"" than about the salvation of souls, we think it right to give the words he is reported to have uttered: ""Once more, I believe that the course which the great body of missionaries have taken on the question of polygamy is a very serious impediment to the progress of our work. Here again, without any authority from the Church of which they are ministers, there are many of the missionary clergy, and even bishops of the Church of England, who have laid down the law that every convert admitted into the Christian Church shall put away all his wives but one, if he had more than one, before baptism. It would be reasonable if they said, \'You need not be baptized at all; you may be good men without being formally received into the Church,\' as there have been good men of old who were never baptized, and who had more wives than one, yet lived.""', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Polygamy in Natal', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have been asked, why attack polygamy in Natal, when it exists and flourishes in so many other parts of the world?

They retain their own laws, and can practice their own barbarous customs, while they have the free use of some of the best lands in the colony. Nor can the colonists be chargeable with having evinced any desire to degrade the social position of the native or to keep him morally where he is. It has been the chief fault of past native policy that it has failed to attempt, by practical measures, the domestic amelioration and mental elevation of the native. So far as a belief in the necessity of civilising processes is concerned, the colonists have always been ahead of the executive authorities in their avowed desire to carry out an extended and practical policy. Earl Grey—when next he rises in the Lords to stigmatise colonial shortcomings—may do so with the conviction that the plans of advancement, enunciated by him fourteen years ago, were then, and have been since, endorsed by the experienced approval of the intelligent colonists of Natal.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Surely it must exist there in a very much modified form to that in which it works such dreadful evils in other parts of native Africa? It must be there, one would suppose, a mere personal matter, doing no injury to others, involving nothing beyond the mere possession by one man of a plurality of voluntary, contented, devoted, happy wives, who would be overwhelmed with grief and sorrow at the mere idea of their lord and master giving them permission to transfer their allegiance to another. How far this is consistent with fact appeared in our number of December 23, 1863, under the head of ""Natal,"" in the following passage:—\n\n""We pointed out some months ago the disgraceful anomaly of polygamy, and other demoralising heathen practices among these Kafirs (of Natal) being upheld, and their rights and claims over the weaker portion of the people enforced by a so-called Christian executive and magistracy. The Natal Mercury has long done battle valiantly against the continued toleration of the abominations alluded to. And the colonial feeling on this subject has been strengthened by three young girls, who refused to be given up, when sold to old polygamists, having been recently tortured to death by slow fire at a stake, and other fiendish cruelties. The cases are well authenticated, and the details are too horrible for insertion. Well may the Mercury say that this woman slavery is \'an astounding feature in the social polity of the colony.\'""'}]","[{'document_title': 'DR. COLENSO ON POLYGAMY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Following this, in leading articles in our numbers of January and February, 1864, we showed how entirely responsible the British Government is for the continuance of this and other Kafir abominations within the colony—a responsibility the more serious because this polygamy means slavery the most abject, cruel, and hopeless—slavery from which there is no escape when once its fetters are closed around the victim; because there, as in all parts of native Africa, it is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. There is no disparity of numbers between the sexes in Africa to make it appear a law of nature that men should have half-a-dozen or twenty wives. Every such monopolist wrongs a number of his neighbours, or his adherence to his ""native customs"" in this respect has been among the causes of bloodshed and violence in wars instigated and undertaken for obtaining supplies of victims for the Bishop\'s amiable and good polygamists. We know that down the West Coast this monopoly of the women by a few leads to disorders, that in their turn conduce to further crimes and atrocities; and among the Natal Kafirs it works in many ways to misery, and at the same time to insecurity among the European portion of the colony. Parents sell their daughters for cattle; the chiefs and comparatively wealthy men thus monopolise a large proportion of the women, making of them wives and slaves, while the young men who have no cattle with which to purchase wives are left unprovided for in this respect, and of course become aggressors on the coveted live human property of their superiors in wealth. It is impossible to conceive a more fruitful source of demoralisation among a people.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DR.

We think that if they did otherwise they would betray their high mission. The Bishop\'s Christianity is beyond our comprehension. It must be remembered that there is no difficulty in getting rid of their surplus wife-slaves. The parents are only too willing to receive them back, provided there be not any return demanded of the cattle that had been paid for them. But in a British colony—especially where, as in Natal, the natives are refugees, who have fled from otherwise certain destruction, and found refuge there—this task ought not to have devolved upon the missionaries; the evil ought long since to have been arrested by the Government. It is most disgraceful that it has not been so arrested. The colonists would certainly have effected this, if they could have obtained the consent of the superior authorities in Downing-street. When, in the numbers of our journal before alluded to, we exposed and commented upon the awful atrocity of torturing those young female Kafirs to death by slow fire at the stake, we foolishly believed that before another twelve months should have passed away the British Government must have taken decided action in the matter. We did not believe that the advocates of polygamy and its inseparable atrocities in such countries as in Africa were so numerous in this Christian land, or that those who are not its advocates would remain so seemingly indifferent to its protected and supported existence in a British colony. We again urge the consideration of this question on the Government and a Christian public, with the view to immediate action. As the British Government have so long culpably permitted and protected this polygamy in Natal, we do not urge any violent measures. We have before pointed out what we think ought to be done, in the following words, which state at the same time the position and the remedy (February 23, 1864): ""Everywhere in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. The hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent? We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trusted of the lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. They are there to receive protection, not to dictate religion or polity. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change. We look, therefore, to Parliament to bring the power of Christian public opinion to bear upon Her Majesty\'s Government in this matter, and to insist upon a limitation of polygamy in the colony of Natal, with a view to its speedy extirpation.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DR.

This at least is not a theological question, and does not in any way rest upon the credibility of the Pentateuch. It is an eminently practical question, and, with reference to the Africans (among whom it is an institution about as respectable as that the ostentatious display of which our magistrates are praiseworthily endeavouring to suppress in Regent-street), is so connected with the subject of their civilization, that, independently of those sentiments regarding it which we entertain in common with the great body of Christians, we have always felt it to be one of the greatest importance.\n\nDr. Colenso has been reading at a meeting of the Anthropological Society a long paper on ""Missionary Efforts among Savages,"" as a sort of reply to one on the same subject previously read by that assailant of missions, Mr. Winwood Reade, who gathered up his wonderful stores of knowledge during a five months\' flying trip along the West Coast of Africa. We leave to the gentlemen of our missionary societies the appreciation of the Doctor\'s defence of Christian missions. He says, in effect, that the efforts of missionaries among savages have been a great blessing to them; but, as to the preaching of Christianity among them being necessary to their salvation, it is all humbug. It is, the Bishop says, ""a horrible delusion,"" that this is at all necessary to their eternal salvation! After this we are more and more at a loss to conceive why the Bishop belongs in any way to a preaching Christian Church. We do not want bishops and clergy for mere secular, industrial, and moral education. And if Christianity is not necessary to salvation in Africa, neither can it be necessary in England. But what we have more especially to deal with is the Bishop\'s defence of polygamy among the natives. And, as we are not less diametrically opposed to him as regards this ""native custom"" than about the salvation of souls, we think it right to give the words he is reported to have uttered: ""Once more, I believe that the course which the great body of missionaries have taken on the question of polygamy is a very serious impediment to the progress of our work. Here again, without any authority from the Church of which they are ministers, there are many of the missionary clergy, and even bishops of the Church of England, who have laid down the law that every convert admitted into the Christian Church shall put away all his wives but one, if he had more than one, before baptism. It would be reasonable if they said, \'You need not be baptized at all; you may be good men without being formally received into the Church,\' as there have been good men of old who were never baptized, and who had more wives than one, yet lived.""', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Polygamy in Natal', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have been asked, why attack polygamy in Natal, when it exists and flourishes in so many other parts of the world? Because there alone in Africa we have absolute power over it; because there alone in Africa we are responsible for it; because there alone in Africa it is a reproach to this Christian nation—a reproach that we hope it will not consent any longer to endure. We have shown what Natal is—that it is the colony of a Christian nation, possessing a Christian population of upwards of 15,000 souls—a colony into which Christian emigrants from Great Britain are entering in a continuous, though not very copious stream—a colony into which a refugee Kafir population now numbering 180,000 has been admitted—a colony in which, notwithstanding the presence of this numerous African people, Coolies are obliged to be imported from India to perform the necessary work of the plantations. It is among those Kafirs that polygamy, as an institution belonging to them before they came into the colony, has been not only tolerated, but protected in the colony, to its manifest prejudice and loss, both in a material and moral point of view. For polygamy among those Kafirs, as in all parts of native Africa, is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. We have been told of late by some of our hasty African travellers, in excuse of the slave-trade, that a great number of the victims carried from Africa in the loathsome slave ships are criminals; and we have heard a sort of lament that where the slave-trade has happily been suppressed, the virtuous communities in question, as at Brass, Bonny, Calabar, &c., have no way of getting rid of their criminals. Well, these so-called criminals are so, if so at all, mostly through the operation of polygamy. The chiefs and head men monopolise all the women—they make of them their wives and slaves—and the lower classes of the population and male slaves are left unprovided with wives. This leads to aggressions on their part upon the coveted live property of their superiors, which becomes particeps criminis. It would be difficult to convey to our readers any adequate idea of the enormous evils resulting from that abominable institution of polygamy. In Dahomey, for example, where the sovereign power is absolute, every female child born in the country, or captured in the predatory expeditions, is the property of the king. Every man in the realm, from the highest to the lowest, receives his wife from the king, either as a gift or by purchase. No man can thus obtain a wife until he has become possessor of a certain sum, which being brought to court during the Customs, he receives a wife of some sort in exchange. In order to prevent the too great multiplication of criminals, which could not fail otherwise to take place, where the bulk of the population are precluded from the possession of wives, a number of women are set aside arbitrarily by the king as the common property of the people at large, upon very easy conditions for the latter. Ashantee is as Dahomey in this abomination. And everywhere else in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle.

The primary effect of Christianity is to reduce the number of wives. The human race are said to be spread of Islamism. Such is the tenor of the new gospel according to Captain Burton. He it is that he propounds this creed with reference only to Africa; but religion and morality are not local, but universal, and that which is true or good in one place will be equally true or good for the family of mankind. Some people may wonder why this apostle of Crescent burning, preaches to Englishmen with so much and patiently to his preaching. But there exist in London an association, young in years, and younger still in wisdom, by whose members these absurdities are not only tolerated, but received with a large measure of approval. The Anthropological Society, which has itself assumed the right of calling itself a learned body, showing its superiority to common prejudices, and every now and then give clear proof that it can be independent of common sense. Captain Burton could not well have chosen a more congenial audience before which to retail the absurdities which spring from hearing his new gospel, he being in no degree reticent. He declared that ""as to polygamy, he could only say of the statement that it was unnatural, that the force of ignorance could go no further."" We beg Captain Burton\'s pardon: even in that lowest degree there is a deeper still, and he has penetrated to the bottom of the abyss. Never was there a more striking combination of consummate ignorance and colossal impudence than in his assertion which he made before the Anthropological Society. He averred that ""the Christian missions were the curse of Western Africa, and the only antidote to it was the spread of Islamism,"" which profession of faith was cheered by sundry members of the Anthropological Society. The regenerating influence of the Mohammedan religion is certainly a novel thesis for an English speaker, and whoever dilates upon it should be gifted with a lively imagination, since he will have to draw upon it for all his facts. But, according to Captain Burton, those wicked preachers of the Gospel have not been content with corrupting African natives by converting them from polygamism under whose benign influence they were wont to wallow in blood and debauchery; they have also degraded African literature. This would appear to be a tough job, but he assures us that they have done the deed, and points out the manner of its accomplishment. ""No doubt,"" he said, ""the Protestant missionaries had had their Scriptures translated into the African tongue, but what a ignoble literature that it was!"" We confess that this fairly takes our breath away and totally incapacitates us from following Captain Burton any further.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Here are large preparations making for a grand country ball which all must attend, and at which grey-headed dames are to be seen teaching the young ones how to dance; there, in the next street, is a host of men and women, boys and girls, drinking and rioting—a funeral custom for a relation who died months ago; and in most cases of this kind a family is put in deep distress and pawned afterwards, to pay for the ruin consumed on the occasion. In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer. All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.\n\nThe ignorance and want of proper training of the female portion in this our community is another calamity; and contributes to the torrent of evil which now flows in this place. The few of them who have been partially taught to read, by mixing with bad company, become very much corrupted; and any civilized and Christian stranger who comes here will be rather astonished at the great number of intelligent-looking young women, most of whom cannot repeat the Lord's Prayer. Born and bred up in all worldliness, without any moral restraint, and not knowing anything by which to benefit themselves, they are prepared and seem destined to be the concubines of captains of vessels, Government officials, and European traders, who invariably abandon them and their offspring entirely after a time. But this sinfulness of parents giving their daughters to white men for the sake of their money is an original practice encouraged here up to the present time; and for now a long period, Accra has won the reputation of being a place where all sorts and conditions of white men can come and take one of these as a concubine, to go anywhere he may choose, at a moment's notice.\n\nThis state of things induced us lately to petition the Government to establish a school here, for the education and moral culture of the rising generation of Accra; and I earnestly pray that the Lord will put it into their hearts to do this."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}]",True

While the textbook does not directly mention the Masasi incident, it emphasizes the broader theme of vulnerability faced by various groups amid tribal conflicts and external pressures, such as colonialism and trade. It discusses the impact of wars, epidemics, and colonial boundaries on societies, suggesting a backdrop of instability that could affect mission stations. The absence of direct reference to mission stations and native converts in the context of Masasi marks a notable gap in the textbook's coverage. In contrast, The African Times provides a detailed account of the Masasi incident, where the Wagwangwara attacked the mission station, resulting in the death and capture of native converts. This highlights the precarious situation of mission stations in conflict zones, with the need for ransom to recover captured native Christians underscoring the challenges in maintaining safety and security.

In revenge for this the traders, five years prior to our arrival, had resolved to 'tengeneze' the native (make them behave). For this purpose a combined caravan of some 1,500 men stationed at Kwa-Sundu [later Mumia] was marched upon them.

They had less direct or even indirect dealings with the foreigners from the coast; in fact in many cases they were unwilling to welcome these foreigners into their societies, although they were willing to sell foodstuffs to caravans on the stopping stations.

Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

They had also become divided into pastoralists, who occupied the Rift Valley plains between central Tanganyika and central Kenya, and the smaller agriculturist group - the Iloikop or Wa-Kwavi - who settled in the area between Mt Kilimanjaro and the Highlands of present-day Kenya. The history of the Maasai during the period under study is dominated by the struggle between these two groups at one level and by further civil strife between the various laibons vying for leadership at another level.\nThis civil conflict drove groups of Maasai in different directions in the hinterland, a notable factor which inhibited an earlier penetration of this section of the interior by Arab and Swahili traders. Groups of Wa-Kwavi raided as far east as the environs of Mombasa. In 1837, a skirmish took place between Wa-Kwavi and an Arab-Swahili party that met them outside the town. The latter was badly mauled in the encounter. Contemporary sources, such as the missionary J. L. Krapf, refer to the recurrent threat posed by the Wa-Kwavi to the Miji Kenda, which justified the defensive aspects of the kaya system.\nWest of the Rift Valley, movement and settlement of peoples took place in the Great Lakes region. These evolved into the Bantu-speaking groups such as the Abaluyia, the Baganda, the Basoga etc., and the Nilotic groups, such as the Luo, the Acholi and others. The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed a continuation of movement, settlement and interaction in that region, as well as a crystallization of diverse political systems within different groups that lent them some relatively distinct identity. For example, in the case of Buganda, a centralized state developed, headed by the ruler (the kabaka), with his insignias of office - drums, stools and spears, and his body of counsellors, the lukiko.

Berntsen$^{41}$ has indicated that the division between the two groups of pastoral Maasai and agricultural Maasai was never permanent. In his own opinion, to try to interpret Maasai history in terms of pastoralists versus agriculturalists 'leads one into insurmountable contradictions. All the Maasai people were pastoralists before a battle or a series of raids; loss of cattle and loss of their access to the pasture lands of the Rift Valley region forced some groups to supplement their subsistence by turning to non-pastoral sources.'$^{42}$ This means that the picture of nineteenth-century Maasai society was much more complicated than explained by earlier studies, i.e. some groups known as Iloikop at one time may be pastoralists at another, depending on their ability to replenish their herds and regain access to rich pasture lands. Yet, as a result of the nineteenth-century wars, more Maasai groups were pushed away from the rift valley and their semi-pastoral life continued into the colonial period. 43 In order to avoid confusion, we shall view these wars in terms of group alliances whose aim was the control of cattle and pasture lands, both considered to be important to pastoral life.\nThe actual causes of conflict may have been varied. The first series of wars took place on the Uasin Gishu plateau. This may have been caused by pressure on grazing land. The pastoral Maasai in the Rift Valley wanted to use the good grassland on the plateau, which was being used by another Maasai group known as the Uasin Gishu. The latter were supported by a number of other Maasai-speaking groups living on the plateau. Eventually, the Uasin Gishu were driven out of the plateau and pushed to other areas.

It appears, therefore, that many raids were undertaken at this time in order to replenish herds lost during the drought. Strife took place in all parts of Maasailand. In the south the Rift Valley Maasai raided groups living further east towards the Pangani river. They succeeded in pushing, these groups out of Kibaya, Shambarai and Naberera and forced them to settle east of the Pangani river, the Kilimanjaro lowlands and Taveta. The settlement of the Arusha on the slopes of Mount Meru is also supposed to have taken place at this time. In the north, there were raids against the Laikipia. But the major conflict took place from i860 to 1864 between the Purko and the Losegalai who lived between Lake Nakuru and the Mau escarpment. A number of the Losegalai fled to the Kipsigis and the Nandi territories. According to traditions collected by Jacobs,$^{44}$ these Maasai refugees were responsible for introducing the oloiboni-like office to the Nandi, where it was known as orkoiyot. This initiated the rise of Nandi power at a time when that of their Maasai neighbours was declining.\nThe end of the second series also concluded an era of Maasai history, for it ended the period of predominantly Maasai control of the Uasin Gishu plateau and heralded the growth in importance there of other Nilotic groups, such as the Nandi and the Kipsigis. It was this weakening of Maasai control of the plateau that made it easier for coastal traders to use the Kenya caravan routes which they had previously avoided.\nThe final series of Maasai wars also centred on the northern plateaux. Mbatian had succeeded Subet as ritual leader in the mid-i86os.$^{45}$ Various alliances were formed, the Purko and the Kisongo pastoral groups, the Laikipia with a number of Iloikop groups, i.e. those who had been pushed out of the good grazing lands and were forced to be semi-agriculturalists as well as pastoralists.

Most of the Rift Valley, plains and open plateaux alike remained under their control but with a greatly reduced population. What finally affected the power of the pastoral Maasai severely were the human and animal diseases that infected the region after the prolonged wars. The large areas covered in the raids brought the Maasai into contact with many other groups and made it possible for infectious and unaccustomed diseases to be passed on from other groups. In 1869, for example, the Maasai lost a large number of people from cholera contracted from the Samburu.$^{46}$ The worst scourge came in the 1880s when a serious outbreak of smallpox coincided with a pleuro-pneumonia epidemic that decimated Maasai herds.

From the point of view of the pastoral Maasai, the Iloikop were inferior since they had taken up a different style of life.

Jacobs interpreted Maasai traditions as pointing to the transformation of the ritual office as the beginning of the rift between the two groups of the Maasai-speaking people.

For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones.

Unfortunately, he missed them, as they had already set out to attack Masasi by another road. The Wagwangwara broke into the mission station before sunrise. Sellim, an old Zanzibar boy and a promising teacher, was killed, with two catechumens, a man and a woman, from Mbweni, with four children. Finding there was no resistance, the Wagwangwara chief was able to restrain his people from further slaughter. Several others were wounded, but are progressing favourably. The plunderers then seized everything they could lay hands upon. Many escaped to the forest and hills, and others to the mission-house compound, which was fortunately surrounded with a stone wall. They captured about thirty-nine or forty, but Porter succeeded in redeeming some of them as far as his barter cloth went, leaving twenty-three native Christian adults and six native Christian children still in slavery. Porter, by all accounts, has acted with great judgment and tact. He managed to come to an understanding with the chief of the robber tribe, and kept them all out of the mission-house and compound, although several attempts were made to get in for the purpose of stealing. They sacked the church, but when they heard it was the House of God they were afraid, and returned the sacred things and furniture of the church. They encamped for some time near the station, and for many days kept wandering about, but without any further molestations. They did not burn any of the mission-houses, although they have burnt all the villages around. They promised to await in the neighbourhood of Majeje, about sixty miles west of Masasi, for the ransom of the native Christians. The chief said he had power to control his people in fighting, but no power to make them restore captives without ransom. Maples or one of the others will follow the Wagwangwara, and try and recover the captives. We have since heard that the tribe have been resisted or attacked by some people, and they have gone off entirely to their own country. This will make the redemption very costly and difficult, as their own land is just to the north-east of the northern end of Lake Nyassa. Maples has a very bad foot, and probably will be unable to go, and I don\'t know who else would be able to manage it, except Mr. Porter—dear, brave fellow!

The missionaries are often involved, and the mission property destroyed, from their attempts to control the lawless and to protect the oppressed.\n\nIn May, 1862, an agent of a Bristol merchant had his cutter seized by a number of armed canoes, and brought back to Cameroons, with the threat that if she attempted to trade with Bimbia again they would break her up and seize the goods.\n\nIn October, 1862, a white man was taken out of a boat employed in the river, and detained on shore many days.\n\nIn the next month an attack was made on the mission premises, and much damage was done. A carpenter (a British subject), was seized at his work, cruelly beaten, and carried away. Three children belonging to the mission schools were stolen, and an attempt was made to shoot down the wife of the missionary, Mr. Fuller. The carpenter received injuries during his month of captivity, from which he never recovered, although he lived on till the close of last year.\n\nThe store and cask-houses of a Liverpool merchant were soon after seized, and the trade quite paralyzed for many weeks; and this seizure of stores could only be put an end to by the sacrifice of much property.\n\nIn May, 1861, the mission boat was boarded when on its way to a distant settlement, with provisions; a British subject was dragged on shore, and chained for five weeks, or until, by a second outrage, the natives had secured the boat itself, which they laid up in a creek where it now lies rotting.\n\nI pass over a multitude of lesser outrages daily committed by these natives, who defy all authority, and content myself by asking—_Are these things to continue?

The origin of the conflict was the refusal of a young Englishman (Mr. Deane) to give up a female slave who had fled from the Arab camp and taken refuge at the station. The Arabs threatened Mr. Deane without effect, and as they were cowed by the presence of the steamer Stanley, a peace was concluded on August 23. Having thus thrown the garrison off its guard, the Arabs suddenly attacked the station on the following day. For three days Mr. Deane and his colleague, M. Dubois, with the Houssa soldiers and the Bangalas, defended the position; but on the evening of the 26th, their ammunition being exhausted, the Houssas and Bangalas took to the canoes and descended the river. The two Europeans remaining at the station saturated the buildings with petroleum, set fire to them, and destroyed the two cannon, the remaining arms, and the rest of the powder. They then fled along the bank of the river, here very precipitous. M. Dubois lost his footing, and, in spite of all his companion's efforts, was lost. Mr. Deane took refuge amongst the native tribes, who treated him with great kindness, supplying him with food and concealing him from the Arabs. It was not until a month later that assistance arrived from Bangalas Station, under Captain Coquilhat, in the steamer L'Association Internationale Africaine. Captain Coquilhat found Stanley Falls in possession of the Arabs, and had not force sufficient to undertake its recapture; but he succeeded in discovering Mr. Deane. He reports that the incidents have had the most excellent effect upon the minds of the natives. Mr. Deane's obstinate defence excited their wonder and admiration, and they were greatly impressed by the fact that sixty of the Arabs were slain, with a loss of only two on the side of the garrison. They are convinced that the whites are not the allies of the Arabs, and their treatment of Mr. Deane shows that they recognize in him a protector against the Arab exactions. The result is, Captain Coquilhat tells us, that while the Arabs are detested, the authority of the whites is respected. The gallant trip of Captain Coquilhat's craft up the river, through a country occupied by the Arabs, to a point only a few hundred yards from the abandoned station, and the success of the search for Mr. Deane have also impressed the natives. All this is very satisfactory; but the circumstances suggest that it will be necessary to send forward a considerable force to inflict signal punishment upon the Arabs. It may be that the new Congo State is on the eve of its first war, and that the Arab slave trade difficulty is about to be forced on to a sanguinary solution. One thing at least seems certain—the new State will have to strengthen its more remote stations very considerably, even though M. Janssens, the Governor of the Congo State, who has just returned to Brussels, states that this incident has no special importance, and will not imperil in any way the work undertaken in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1887#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Explorations in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""I never came actually to blows with any hostile tribe; indeed, I never fired a shot at a native all the time I have been in Africa.

Scarcely, however, had the steamers which had been sent to the relief of the station returned to Stanley Pool before two were again despatched to quell another disturbance which had broken out at Luluaburg on the Kasai. This time it was a revolt of the State troops against their own officers. The soldiers killed one and wounded another, leaving him for dead upon the field. They then looted the station and escaped into the interior. Although the authorities sent up a strong detachment of forces from Stanley Pool, most of the fugitives are still at large. I was near the mouth of the Kasai when the news of the revolt came down.\n\n""The attitude of the Natives of the Congo State is unfriendly, and if they do not rebel it is because they are reduced to a state of despair. If possible they leave the territory. Two of the most flourishing towns at Stanley Pool—viz., Kintamo and Kinchassa—are now no more, and the people have gone over to the French Congo. Besides, many people have left the main river and gone into the interior to escape the arbitrary demands of the State. Difficulties arose, too, between the State and the porters, and if the requisite number of carriers were not forthcoming detachments of soldiers were ordered to capture all the women they could find. Several Christians were arrested in this manner. The Natives and missionaries remonstrated, and presented a letter to the Governor without getting any redress. The people were so enraged at these outrages that they took matters into their own hands. They killed three white men and met and defeated the State forces in more than one pitched engagement. On the Lower Congo the Natives have good Snider rifles, and their many conflicts with the State have taught them the arts of war.

So much was this credited, that without further inquiry, we were surprised on the morning of the 17th ultimo, to observe the Houssas digging a shelter-trench and huddling a redoubt in connection, opposite Jellah Coffee. After this there was expenditure of rockets from the Fort at night, I presume to show that we were on the alert, but all these forces were of no use, since there was really no impending danger from the Anlos. While applauding Captain Ellis, the District Commissioner for his promptness and readiness evinced to meet the imaginary attacks from the Anlo people, I cannot but condemn his ill-fated adventurous trip over the other side of the river, some five or six miles beyond his jurisdiction; by which trip, a fresh disturbance was created. On the other side of the river, about some six hours' travelling by canoe, lies a village or market-place called Bolari. Formerly it was only a market-place, where the people disposed on the market-day their commodities for sales; and the market for the day being over, they then dispersed to their various towns. But at present it is partially inhabited. Gliding along the river this market town is not visible, being hidden by tall rushes and weeds and cocoa-nut trees, so that one can only reach it by a hitch.\n\nTo this place on Wednesday, the 23rd ultimo, our District Commissioner of Quittah, accompanied by Captain Leaver, Master of the ship Alligator, of Messrs. T. and A. Swanzy, went in a boat of the above firm on a deer-hunting excursion; and instead of returning with some deer or other game (which it was not possible to find there), they have returned with a most lamentable report.

After stubborn resistance at Kapashida, where the Government interpreter, Mr. A. C. Willoughby, was shot through the head, and Captain Hardinge received a wound in the thigh, the Jebus fled, leaving the towns of Eredo, Ayo, and Agushi in the hands of the British. The great battle was fought at Magbon. Captain Hardinge's wound was fortunately slight, and he kept leading his men. The Jebu Army was found to be strongly posted in the rear of the Oshun River, which was overshadowed by a dense forest. They were about 7,000 to 10,000 strong, and were well supplied with arms and ammunition. The British force had to pass through a ravine, in single file, with but a few inches footing. On each side was a thick wood, in which the Jebus were posted, and from which they poured out a continuous and heavy fire. The passage was so intricate that as the men fell, either killed or wounded, they had to be lifted out and placed on one side to allow the others of the force to pass. As soon as the British force reached the open, however, the Jebus had to fly with great loss. Now came the most difficult part of the operations. The enemy were on the opposite bank of the river. The native troops hesitated to go into the water in the face of such a hot fire as the Jebus were keeping up.

When the troops reached the opposite bank the Jebus could not stand their withering fire. At the end of two hours the Jebu army was completely defeated, and the King was taken prisoner to Lagos.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

In East Africa, especially Kenya, African prophets arose to provide spiritual reinvigoration$^{7}$ to resist colonialism, such as occurred in the Machakos District among the people of Kilungu in the early months of 1922 (see Chapter 26). One of the best-known movements which used both religion and magic to resist colonial rule and oppression was the Majï Majï movement in German East Africa during the first decade of the twen› tieth century.$^{8}$ (See Fig. 7.1.) Even though the movement failed, it served as a demonstration of the fact that unity could be achieved in African traditional religion in the face of European pressure and that African traditional religion was not a fragmentary force confined to limited localities. Besides, the movement provided the seed for African nationalism which was later to germinate and blossom into the struggle for independ› ence and its final achievement in the 1960s.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literary culture in the Western Sudan', 'content': ""We have already commented on some devices employed by the 'autoch› thones' against the mechanisms of cultural negation employed by European colonialism; the Islamic culture, in the proselytizing polity of the Dyula, was to encounter the same resistance.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The persistence and transformation of African cultural values in Latin America and the Caribbean', 'content': 'The problem of colour distinctions arises in different ways, for, according to Roger Bastide, \'whether the colour line is institutionalized, as in the United States, or not, the result is the same.

In Haiti, for example, where the black population is in the majority, a characteristically African religion was influenced by the structural realities of Haitian society and the role of the half-castes, and underwent a series of changes set in motion by new \'gods\' that met the requirements of the new situation. In the neighbouring islands, as a result of Protestant mission work, a \'black culture\' had already taken shape in various movements such as that of the Rastafarians (a Messianic wave of reaction against the white overlord in which African imagery was thinly veiled, Haile Sellassie being cast as Messiah). On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained.

The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders.

The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition.

Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder. These they get in return for a few months\' or a year\'s labour, to go back home and for a few short days enjoy a fiendish holiday. I visited one of their villages and such a scene of squalor and misery I have rarely seen. Yet it is said, and I believe with truth, that if you retain a Kru-boy in the most comfortable of traders\' homes longer than a year, he will sicken and die, so much does he pine for his savage and unsavoury home.\n\nIn these villages, men, women, and children, with scarcely a rag upon their persons, follow you about beseeching for a little gin or tobacco. Eternally gin, tobacco, or gunpowder. These are the sole wants aroused by a century of trade and contact with Europeans! And yet how is this region represented in England?

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

And the traders, with one exception, are as remorseless as the grave. If they can gain a few pounds of ivory or india-rubber, they care not if the liquor they sell destroys every living being in Africa. There is perfect recklessness in those who come here; no thought for anything except for the greatest gain in the two or three years they are to remain. And how many of them, when counting the few days to their departure, and seeing home and all its joys so near, were cut down in a day! Death laid his hand on them, and visions of home became dark as Erebus. And there was no miracle and no special providence in this. It was only rendering to every man according to his deeds. And if rum has killed a fourth or a third of this people since we came here, it has killed quite as large a proportion of the traders who have sold the poison. Where the foot of the white man has never trod, the fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed. Some people wonder why the Coast tribes of Africa waste away and disappear. It is no wonder to one who has lived here with his eyes open, unless he himself has come within the maelstrom. The Coast is beleaguered with the hosts of Satan; and they are bold, persistent, untiring, unscrupulous, and unmerciful. If you wish to know some of the concomitants of the rum trade and rum-drinking, read Proverbs xxiii. 33. These are our real obstacles. Heathenism is bad, but unmixed it is not impregnable.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

On one hand, the text acknowledges that traditional beliefs, such as witchcraft and initiation rites, persisted despite missionary and colonial efforts to eradicate them, suggesting a resistance to full cultural change and adoption of Christianity. This persistence indicates that deep-rooted beliefs did pose obstacles to the complete acceptance of new religious and cultural systems. On the other hand, the text also highlights instances of syncretism, where African societies blended traditional beliefs with Christian practices, creating new religious expressions that accommodated both systems. This adaptation suggests that rather than hindering spiritual development, traditional beliefs facilitated a unique form of cultural and religious evolution. Furthermore, the text argues that the impact of colonialism on African culture was superficial and temporary, with traditional practices continuing robustly in rural areas. This observation challenges the notion that traditional beliefs were a significant barrier to perceived civilization, as African societies selectively integrated new elements while maintaining their cultural identity.

In spite of the opposition to witchcraft by both missionaries and colonial admini› strators, the belief persisted among converts and non-converts alike, and Africans continued to resort to their own ways of dealing with it.\nSome of the new cults which arose to protect people from witchcraft in West Africa may be mentioned, for example, Aberewa (Old Woman) cult in the Gold Coast which was suppressed by the administration in 1908. The most widespread of the witchcraft eradication movements was the Bamucapi cult of south-eastern and Central Africa which spread widely over Mozambique, Nyasaland (now Malawi), the Rhodesias (now Zim› babwe and Zambia), southern Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and Belgian Congo (now Zaire).

In Uganda, for example, a Witchcraft Ordinance was passed in 1912; in 1921 it was revised, the punishment being made severer by increasing terms of imprisonment from one to five years and also making the possession of witchcraft articles in which the power of witchcraft is believed to reside a punishable offence. 1 $^{3}$ But all these ordinances of the colonial governments and condemnation by missionaries and African converts proved to be limited deterrents to the belief in witchcraft.\nAnother attack on African traditional religion took the form of measures against initiation rites of boys and girls into adulthood.

This policy avoided a head-on collision between traditional initiation and Christian missions and practice, even though the Church omitted an essential element in the girls' initiation, namely, the elongation of the clitoris, and thus failed to give malango the type of respectability that traditional initiation otherwise commanded. The Church, however, recognised the need for its' members to be at once Christians and fully initiated members of their communities, and this objective was achieved within the Church rather than in revolt against it. 14 But in the case of the Central Province of Kenya, the missionary policy towards initiation resulted in a head-on collision.

This move also coincided with the activities of a number of missions, for example the Scottish Mission (in Ukambani in 1891 and Kikuyu in 1898), Bavaria Evangelical Lutheran Mission (in Ukambani, 1893), African Inland Mission (in Ukambani, 1896), Gospel Missionary Society (in Nairobi, 1897) and Church Missionary Society and African Inland Mission (in Nairobi, both in 1901), which began to speak against the cherished traditions of the Akamba, Meru, Tharaka, Maasai and other peoples, especially that of initiation using circumcision of both boys and girls.

'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group.

These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete. No wonder anti-colonial protest was accompanied by disenchantment with those who had brought the new faith to them, a disenchantment with the Europeans as genuine Christians and with racial discrimination in the established churches.

Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

' 2 They completed the task which Islam had begun by forbidding their adherents membership of any cult. These theatre companies were run like family guilds, with the familiar practice of trade secrets and initiatory rites; their material was also firmly rooted in the traditional - all of which qualified them for definition as devilish, sinister cults. The Christian missionaries, like the Muslims, did not content themselves with banning only the performances. Like the mbira in Southern Africa, instruments which were associated with such theatre arts were banished with equal vigour. A vacuum was thus created into which the returnee slaves' culture neatly stepped. The slave trade had been instrumental to the process of religious conversion on the west coast even as it proved detrimental to cultural life, as manifested, in the affected societies.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

If the old man himself can't trade, he will try to do it by and through his children; and hence the cause of continual complaint that children are early removed from school when they were but beginning to learn, and too young to be confirmed in the principles of their moral training.\n\nThese difficulties have been often started, but has any remedy been hitherto suggested? If it has, where is it now in operation, and what is its result? Is the complaint removed? If so, why is it that one hears of these difficulties still existing, and proving an almost insurmountable barrier to further progress.\n\nBut I respectfully submit that the remedy is as simple, and as clear as simple. The body, or the moral culture of the mind that guides it, must be adapted to its future life. The early training of the child for the cultivation of the soil, where the soil has to be cultivated and subjected to the use of man, must consist not only in the teaching, but in the showing to the child what, when, and how such may be done. Schools might have portions of ground given to them for purposes of illustration; and a profit, by the working of the children, might accrue to the school, and *be shared in by the children also.* Arts and manufactures might gradually be introduced; an interest, by practical illustration, might be thrown into the subject of study or employment; and as the child might largely share the gain, the parents would be benefited, and the child to the man instructed. Thenceforth the man, anxious to show his skill, to settle comfortably in life, and make provision for the future, would be seen to convert a waste land to a farm, a hut into a comfortable house, a wilderness to a paradise and a home.""}, {'id': 686, 'article_title': 'Our Special Correspondent and Ex-Governor Mr. Richard Pine', 'full_section_title': 'Our Special Correspondent and Ex-Governor Mr. Richard Pine', 'last_edit_date': '08-10-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_09_1865', 'content': ""The only Governor who saw the advantage of enlisting our influence was Sir Benjamin Pine, who, to the utter amazement of the friends of the old system, showed us a very warm friendship, and heard our advice, as he knew he could depend upon our reports.

To influence the lives of a people to whom these principles were once unknown belongs to Christian education so begun. One of the greatest helps a people can offer to those who would teach them the ways of civilised life is the encouragement held out by the natives themselves towards the work they are anxious to accomplish. ""Come over and help us"" is the recorded invitation to the early Apostles, from a country that had not yet heard more than a rumor of the new religion. Some of the readers of the African Times may already suspect that the locality of Cape Coast Castle is in the present writer\'s mind. Its especial claim to help arises from the anxiety of the native chiefs to see an increase of English influence diffused among their people. The means to procure what they desire appear to be within the easy grasp of such as desire to obtain them. If the merchants of the district had no higher aim than the profit of their mercantile traffic, they would find that was aided by the employment of educated labourers rather than uneducated men. Education does not necessarily consist in the knowledge of so many words, or languages, or sciences. Education is rather the rousing of latent mental and perceptive power, so as to make it available for common life. In this lowest estimate of education it is profitable to an African employer by giving him more intelligent service than he has been accustomed to expect; the work is better done by an artisan or clerk who performs it intelligently than by one who only acts on his own unawakened powers in the matter. This argument can be pursued in reference to the further diffusion of education for the practical purposes of life among the natives, both male and female, on the Gold Coast. There is also an extended district to be affected by the establishment of an English system of teaching for both rich and poor who desire to seek such advantages, and who are hindered by distance from seeking in England the education they covet. The English system of teaching proposed in reference to Cape Coast Castle has for its especial object the Christian education of the native women and girls of that country. These need help; every one who has devoted thought and labour in the work of education knows that the women of a people exercise great influence either for good or evil. It is a dreadful truth in connexion with the French Revolution of the last century, that the degraded women were far more furious in their cruelties and their sins than the men of the same epoch. The women and girls, then, should be the especial objects for Christian education where it is begun as something new amongst them; and there are many native and other merchants, as well as influential men, who are wishing to see remedied this evil of ignorance among the females of the land. Raise the women, and the whole community will in a few years be raised in social, moral, and, above all, in religious character. St. Paul wrote of the refined heathens of civilised Rome, ""They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator."" Civilization is not rightmindedness; idolatry is the sin of the natural heart untrained to seek for spiritual influences. The young female mind is impressive to truth. Faith, it has been said, is more easy to the clinging nature of a woman than to the more vigorous will and understanding of a man. The holy precepts of the Bible must be the foundation of all that is to advance and improve the native character of the African; and who shall measure the result on the civilization and well-being of the country arising from the tiny seed of first principles implanted in the young, and nourished by practice and by example in all that is holy, and just, and true? Dr. Johnson once said, ""Whatever causes the past or the future to predominate over the present raises us in the scale of thinking beings."" This is the key-note for us to strike in order to dispel ignorance. A thought elicited is a first step towards the perception of a higher state of being and of aspiration than has hitherto been presented.'}, {'id': 969, 'article_title': ""MRS.

It is not, as some have stated (unjustly and unkindly), the want of intellect or the repugnance evinced by the natives to receive assistance and information from those who have so long laboured amongst them, but from the deep-rooted superstition which prevails, inherited from their forefathers, which cannot be at once eradicated from their minds.\n\n""The natives generally are particularly intelligent, very grateful, and anxious to gain information, not addicted to the violent passions and cruelties practised by other unchristian nations. Why, then, should not the great cause of Christian civilization progress in West Africa as in other settlements?\n\n""It is, in my opinion, because the female part of the community are kept in such a degraded state. They are uneducated, and looked upon by the other sex as mere slaves, and treated as such. Their lives are devoted to manual labour, and their persons frequently sold or pawned to supply the pecuniary wants of their owners, instead of being respected and looked up to as equals, and helpmates in Christian and domestic happiness. Until the female population is raised to its proper position, Christian civilization can never arrive at that standard which we are all anxious to witness, and which it is our duty, as followers of Christ, to endeavour to reach.\n\n""Mrs. Moseley, the widow of the much-beloved and respected judge who was stationed at Cape Coast, and greatly esteemed and regretted by all, and especially by the native population, has, I am happy to find, come forward and offered her services in establishing an infant female school at Cape Coast.\n\n""With God\'s assistance, and a person so well qualified as Mrs. Moseley, we may look forward to great results.

As yet, no material progress has been made among the greater mass of the people as regards Christianity, in spite of the efforts of the missionary agents, and in a population which is numbered by thousands. The number of true Christians in it is comparatively small indeed; the greater part of the people still remain in utter ignorance and darkness, and most of the upper and intelligent portion, who should show a noble example to others, do rather manifest a natural antipathy to religion, or are too proud to go to the House of Prayer.\n\nThe Sabbaths here are vilely profaned, and very often are weekdays, when drum-beating, singing and dancing are loudly carried on, even in front of the House of God, during Divine service. I have never heard of any people on the West Coast settlements, boasting as we do of civilization, and having the advantages of becoming a more Christian and enlightened people, in whom the natural propensity to worldly pleasures and enjoyments is so powerfully predominant. The aged and the young, parents with their children, males and females, are to be seen in crowds in different quarters of the town, night and day, abandoning themselves to revelry and licentiousness which it is truly painful to behold. Here are large preparations making for a grand country ball which all must attend, and at which grey-headed dames are to be seen teaching the young ones how to dance; there, in the next street, is a host of men and women, boys and girls, drinking and rioting—a funeral custom for a relation who died months ago; and in most cases of this kind a family is put in deep distress and pawned afterwards, to pay for the ruin consumed on the occasion. In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer. All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.577, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'that has deepened and intensified the horrors of an enormity, barbarism, and bloody superstition which so pre-eminently characterise Africa?\n\nWithout at present particularising our efforts in other parts of Africa, let us instance those we have been and are making for obtaining roads on the Gold Coast, and especially from the seacoast to the Ashantee frontier. Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success. The creation and maintenance of good roads, where such facilities for intercommunication have hitherto been unknown, would be a great and useful exhibition of the power of Christian civilization. They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations. And every stage of that amelioration would be a material argument that all could appreciate in favour of that Christianity which the missionary would be engaged in teaching. Such palpable evidences that Christianity has the ""promise of the life that now is"" will dispose them the more readily to believe that it has also indeed and in truth ""the promise of that which is to come."" And in our humble opinion it is as much the duty of a Christian people to exhibit such material evidences to the heathen, as adjuncts to missionary teaching, as it is their duty to send the latter. The material blessings which God has bestowed upon the world through Christianity ought to be pressed into his service as allies of Gospel truth. These can exercise an influence upon the yet unconverted heathen, and predispose him to listen to those who may be striving for his eternal welfare, although of themselves they are, of course, without any regenerating power; and may even, when unaccompanied by Christianity, only add new vices to the old degradation.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

The only existent civilization, that of the countries under the Roman sway, was a civilization of violence and slavery—a civilization that included most degrading superstitions, and excesses at the record of which all Christian people shudder. Beyond the limits of Roman dominion all was darker still. Cruel superstitions everywhere prevailed, and the whole earth was full of violence and blood. It is not our purpose to recapitulate; we merely appeal to the broad and well-known facts of history. We will just glance, however, at one that touches us most nearly—the fact of the condition of the greater portion of Europe—of what is now France, Germany, Britain. Lands of forests and swamps, roadless as the African bush, inhabited for the most part by naked populations, whose bodies were protected and ornamented by fat and paint, upon the altars of whose false gods human victims were offered—human blood was constantly flowing! Need we say more? True, these people were of fair complexion, and so beautiful, that captives from among them carried to Rome excited general admiration. But with this difference, what is there in the state and condition of Africa and the African people that could not have found a parallel in the state and condition of these now most highly-favoured countries and peoples? Nothing really. Evil ruled in them as as it rules now in Africa, and it produced there fruits that attend its sway everywhere, and which make the greater portion of native Africa so loathsome. These countries emerged from their barbarism. How? By their own unaided effort? No. The pre-existing civilising agencies, imperfect and corrupt though they were, were brought to bear upon them. The Romans formed high military roads through them. Successive invasions, military colonies, the influence of new inhabitants, worked gradual changes. And then the great and glorious life-giving light of Christianity came in with its mighty transforming powers. Look at Europe now. It is far from being all that a Christian would desire. But even those among its favoured peoples who profess to scorn and contemn Christianity are greatly under the controlling influence of its precepts, because the civilization which prevails and governs, though still an imperfect one, is, nevertheless, a Christian civilization.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.57, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With these accounts of the rapid spread of Islam we may compare statements as to the comparative failure of Christianity, which, unlike Mohammedanism, is propagated and supported by vast subsidies from England and America. Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How Commerce Alone Civilizes', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trade in palm oil in the Brass river is very considerable.

He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man."" Speaking of the coast tribes in the neighbourhood of our colonies at Sierra Leone and Lagos, he affirms that ""for every African who is influenced for good by Christianity, a thousand are driven into deeper degradation by the gin trade."" Passing from the nominally Christian settlements on the coast through the ""degraded cannibals"" who inhabit the lower reaches of the Niger, he arrived at the central Soudan, and says: ""The sights and scenes I there witnessed burst upon me like a revelation. I found myself in the heart of Africa, among undoubted negroes; but how different from the unwashed, unclad barbarians it had hitherto been my lot to meet in my travels in Africa!"" He found large, well-built cities, the people voluminously and picturesquely dressed, moving about with self-possessed, sober dignity. He found on all sides the signs of an industrious community, far advanced on the road to civilization, exercising various...\n\n[Nov. 1, 1887.\n\ncrafts; various metals were worked, cloth was made and dyed, there were crowded markets, and well-tilled fields. What had produced these marvellous results? ""Mohammedanism it was, without a doubt, which had breathed this fresh, vigorous life into these negroes,"" and had ""transformed numerous tribes of savages into semi-civilized nations."" Islam has swept away fetishism, with all its degrading rites. ""No longer did the naked savage throw himself before stocks and stones, or lay offerings before snakes or lizards; but, as a well-clothed and reverent worshipper, he bent before that One God whose greatness and compassionateness he continually acknowledged."" Islam, he affirms, holds sway ""from the Nile to the Atlantic, and from the Sahara to within between four and six degrees of the Equator."" He tells us it is not only proselytizing among the heathen, but in Sierra Leone and Lagos ""it has thrown down its gage to Christianity for the possession of the natives, and reports speak of it spreading rapidly, and recruiting its ranks from the Christian community to no small extent.""', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Thomson agrees with Dr. Blyden as to the causes of these astonishing results. The spectacle of the earnestness, poverty, and simplicity of the Moslem missionaries has a powerful effect on the minds of the negroes, while the greed and the evil lives of Europeans go far to neutralize any good results that may accrue from the teaching of Christianity. Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""

Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity.

The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like.

Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area.

In the first instance they were particularly vulnerable to external pressures, as suggested by the willingness of the Afro-Portuguese and Chikunda to serve as Lisbon's imperial agents.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': ""The desire to return to a life independent of white rule, that is a return to the status quo ante, comes out clearly in the revolts of the Borgawa and Ohori-Ije in French Dahomey and of various Igbo groups in Owerri province of Nigeria.$^{32}$ To a greater or lesser extent the desire to get rid of the white overlord runs through the majority of revolts against French authority in West Africa. Certainly one of the exacerbating factors in the rising of the Egba in 1918 in Southern Nigeria was the very recent loss of their semi-independent status at the outbreak of the war. In Egypt, the Wafd riots which took place immediately after the war were largely inspired by a desire to shake off the recently imposed British protectorate, which, in its short wartime life of four years, had proved itself excessively ob› noxious to nationalists and fallähtn alike. In Madagascar 500 Malagasy, mainly intellectuals, were arrested at the end of 1915 and accused of 'forming a well-organised secret society with the aim of expelling the French and restoring a Malagasy government'. 33 A major concern of the Allied powers during the war was that Turkey's entry on the German side might encourage dissidence among their Muslim subjects. While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians. The British in Northern Nigeria, which was predominantly Muslim, were very sensitive to the possible impact of Islamic propaganda there, but the community of interest established between the Sultan and emirs of the Sokoto Caliphate and the British ensured the loyalty of the bulk of Northern Nigerian Muslims."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': ""In South Africa the Afrikaner revolt of late 1914 against the government's decision to support the Allies was due both to pro-German sympathy and hatred of Britain. The Germans themselves did their best to provoke dis› affection among the African subjects of the Allies, being particularly active along the north-eastern border of Nigeria and in Libya. In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action.

Asiwaju has termed 'protest migrations' to the neighbouring British territories.$^{45}$ To avoid recruitment teams, inhabitants of whole villages fled to the bush.

Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""A black rabbi, Arnold Ford, from Barbados (via New York) emigrated to Ethiopia in 1930 and entertained in the Tambourine Club with Negro spirituals before it was 'closed down by the government for discriminating against local Ethiopian clients'.$^{9}$ While in Harlem, Ford became attracted to Garvey's message.

You will do well to bring these Awoonlah troubles vividly before the British public, for it has stood so long and has completely ruined others.

They have not lent their energy by adding to the natural wealth of this country. There is not now one educated native buying palm-oil in this place.

He did not take this step in an unfriendly spirit towards missionaries, but to remove a blot which would impede Christianity and the march of exploration and research. The 24th and 25th Victoria, chap. 100, section 9, laid it down that when any murder or manslaughter was committed in any part of the world whatever, whether the victim was a British subject or not, the person charged might be tried for the crime in this country. He (Dr. Cameron) based his case entirely on the admissions made by missionaries themselves. In a pamphlet published a short time ago by Mr. Chermside, it was stated that during the spring of 1879 the missionaries at Blantyre, in Central Africa, caused one native to be shot to death for murder, and another to receive upwards of 200 lashes for stealing a chest of tea. The latter in consequence of the punishment died a few hours afterwards. By reference to various communications, Dr. Cameron showed that the Blantyre missionaries admitted these acts, but denied that the death of the man flogged was caused by that punishment. They further admitted that collisions with the natives had taken place, and lives had been lost in their attempts to establish criminal jurisdiction. Another case was much more serious. In the early part of 1878, a missionary named Brown organized, according to his own statements, a war against the natives of New Britain, an island in the Duke of York group near Sydney, the offence of those people being that they had killed and eaten four missionaries. The result, Mr. Brown said, was that ""probably between fifty and eighty lives were lost, but the present and the future good of thousands will far out-balance that."" Sir Arthur Gordon was commissioned to inquire into the matter, but on the day before the one appointed for the trial of Mr. Brown he informed that person that for his own part he should not have thought the case called for an inquiry. The result of this expression of opinion was that the Attorney-General for Fiji refused to prosecute, and Mr. Brown was not tried. Having stated that he would not interfere with the right of self-defence, Dr. Cameron referred to the doings of Mr. Stanley in Africa. Finally, he contended that whenever uncivilized people needed chastisement it should be inflicted by authorized persons, and every missionary or traveller should not be allowed to take upon himself the power of life and death.

Clarke, Richards, and Ingham, reached Stanley Pool in safety about Christmas. They went up on the south side from Banza Manteka, to a point opposite Bemba, passing through forty miles of country not previously traversed by Europeans. They found it very thickly populated, and passed villages, or \'towns\' as they are called, every few miles.\n\nmet buffalo and elephant tracks continually, encountering one herd of the former more closely than was at all agreeable. The people were comparatively fearless and friendly, and food was fairly abundant, large gardens in good cultivation surrounding most of the towns. At Bemba they crossed to the northern bank of the Congo, and proceeded on that side to Stanley Pool, reconnoitring the country with a view to the selection of good sites for mission stations. They walked 169 miles, thirty-one of which were on Mr. Stanley\'s road, now nearly overgrown with grass. They had much difficulty in procuring food for their thirty Kroo boys on this side, but, by paying rather highly for it, managed to get a sufficiency. Bwa-bwa Njali, and the other chiefs at the Pool, received them at first in a friendly way, but afterwards, for some unexplained reason, turned suddenly hostile, and refused to let them cross the river, in order to carry out the plan they had formed of returning by the south side. Our friends had reason to suspect the adverse influence was a foreign one, similar to that which opposed Messrs. Crudgington and Bently on their visit. They returned consequently as far as Nkenke River, near which they secured land for a station from the friendly chief of a populous district; cut timber, cleared the ground, and began to build. It was needful, however, to bring up stores from Bemba, to which station, consequently, they returned after a month\'s absence. Letters from home which met them there decided them, before continuing their building near Inkissi, to explore the rest of the south side from Bemba up to Stanley Pool, so as to be in a position to determine by which road it would be best to carry up the steamer for the upper river. They started on this second journey of exploration about the middle of January, Mr. Ingham remaining at Bemba with Mr. Frederickson, and Mr. Lanceley going forward with the pioneer party. We are thankful to add that the health report is far better than usual, both from the travellers and from all the stations, and that the missionaries, each and all, seem full of earnest zeal and holy courage for their difficult work.""'}, {'id': 4478, 'article_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_08_1882', 'content': 'The Duke Town Congregation in its new relation, and the stations connected with it, are doing well.

The Hovas are everywhere drilling, and otherwise preparing for resistance, a large force being already assembled at the capital, from which, if necessary, reinforcements could be sent to the threatened districts in the north-west. In the event of hostilities breaking out, much anxiety is felt regarding the safety of the Europeans in outlying districts, where the foreign population would probably be attacked indiscriminately, the natives there being quite unable to distinguish between French and English. A further result of a struggle would be the development of a strong feeling against Christianity. Already the leaders of the Old Party are going through the country preaching that the present difficulties are owing to the admission of the missionaries and the conversion of the Court. If this movement were to gather strength, Christianity would probably disappear over a great part of the country, and the people would relapse into barbarism. The British subjects whom I have met here complain bitterly of the fact that there is no English representative at the Hova capital, and they ascribe many of the recent complications to that cause. The evil consequences of this omission are twofold. In the first place, British commercial interests are necessarily neglected; and in the second place, when a crisis such as the present occurs, the want of diplomatic representation makes itself keenly felt. Just now the presence of an active and experienced English diplomatist would be of immense service, not only to England, but also to the Government of Queen Ranavalo.

The natural results of the prolonged and increasing uneasiness are becoming manifest, and I am informed that the trade with the interior is rapidly falling off.

Of all desire for such enterprises Tonquin has cured them for a long time. They know too well the hardships and sufferings that are implied to echo the warlike wishes of the country. They know too well how many suffer and are worn out without recompense, how many have to struggle in obscurity after the conquest seems at an end, to encourage France with a light heart to enter upon enterprises of this kind so long as a really patriotic interest is not at stake. Henri Rivière was actuated by a personal ambition which urged him to adventures in Tonquin. This strange country, which it was thought could be conquered with fifty men, and which has not been subdued with 50,000, was more attractive than the miserable and deadly Dahomey. No; it is not the soldiers, not the seafaring forces, who favour an attack on Dahomey. You will be surprised when I tell you that it is the commercial houses established on the coast who desire to involve France in this enterprise, and who employ the most extraordinary means to accomplish their ends. It is not the first time that such things have happened. We have seen them in Senegambia and elsewhere at work in the same way. It is sometimes missionaries, sometimes employés on the coast, who have lost their way as if by accident in the interior, and who almost provoke their capture, who enable the trading houses to make a great noise and to call for the intervention of the mother country, and who involve it in a war of conquest. They do so because by this means their fortunes are increased a hundredfold, for a factory worth 10,000f. on a coast under savage rule is worth 1,000,000f. on one which has become French.\n\nNow, on the coast of Dahomey the most important business house is at the same time the one most skilful in pushing its interests by the most varied means. The firm is now Monte & Fabre, but in reality it is simply the old house of Régis, the first settled on the coast. Curious stories are told of its early doings. It is said that it began by collecting shells which the King of Dahomey used as money. Goods were purchased with them, about which statements are made which it would now be difficult to verify. In our time the shells are no longer used as coin, and the merchandise is one of a kind now difficult to remove. Accordingly the old house of Régis, young again in its successors, would not object to a change enabling it to carry on business not on Dahomian but on French territory, or on territory protected by France.'}, {'id': 6666, 'article_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'full_section_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-4', 'issue_date': '02_12_1895', 'content': 'Further details of the state of affairs in the Congo Free State have been lately received. They are furnished by the Rev. John B. Murphy, of the American Baptist Mission, who has just reached England. Mr. Murphy comes from Equatorville, an important centre of the State Government, 800 miles in the interior, and has lived on the Congo for the past nine years. Regarding the situation when he left in August, Mr. Murphy said:\n\n""When I left the people were in a very unsettled condition, and most unfriendly to the State. The revolt which had broken out in the Aruwimi district had been quelled, but not until the State troops, which had retired upon Basoko and had to withstand a siege there, had been reinforced. Scarcely, however, had the steamers which had been sent to the relief of the station returned to Stanley Pool before two were again despatched to quell another disturbance which had broken out at Luluaburg on the Kasai. This time it was a revolt of the State troops against their own officers. The soldiers killed one and wounded another, leaving him for dead upon the field. They then looted the station and escaped into the interior. Although the authorities sent up a strong detachment of forces from Stanley Pool, most of the fugitives are still at large. I was near the mouth of the Kasai when the news of the revolt came down.\n\n""The attitude of the Natives of the Congo State is unfriendly, and if they do not rebel it is because they are reduced to a state of despair. If possible they leave the territory. Two of the most flourishing towns at Stanley Pool—viz., Kintamo and Kinchassa—are now no more, and the people have gone over to the French Congo. Besides, many people have left the main river and gone into the interior to escape the arbitrary demands of the State. Difficulties arose, too, between the State and the porters, and if the requisite number of carriers were not forthcoming detachments of soldiers were ordered to capture all the women they could find. Several Christians were arrested in this manner. The Natives and missionaries remonstrated, and presented a letter to the Governor without getting any redress. The people were so enraged at these outrages that they took matters into their own hands. They killed three white men and met and defeated the State forces in more than one pitched engagement. On the Lower Congo the Natives have good Snider rifles, and their many conflicts with the State have taught them the arts of war. In some of the fights the State soldiers could not see their foes as the latter were in ambush.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition. Again, the captive African, in trading Arabia, is set free when he embraces Islam, and treated as a man and a brother, for ""all true believers are brethren."" In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion. The evils of Arabian slavery are not so bad as those resulting from the system of modern capitalism, and the trade itself is often an obstacle to the capacity of European adventurers, greedy for cheap labour, cheap ivory, and markets into which to shoot cheap home-made goods.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary.

The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Lagos Mission of the Church Missionary Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I beg you will allow me space in your columns to give one more instance in support of your frequent endeavours to point out the disadvantages to which the educated Africans on the West Coast are subject by their more favoured European brethren, be they missionaries, merchants, or Government officials.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Harford-Battersby, hon. secretary to the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee, writes to the London papers: ""A few days ago I returned from the West Coast of Africa, the primary object of my trip being to visit the Niger Mission as a representative of the Church Missionary Society. I was able, however, on my journey to and fro along the coast to make some special investigations with regard to the liquor traffic, and in view of the great urgency of this subject at the present time I venture to offer a few observations on this most important subject. The great difficulty at the present time is the unequal competition of the various political divisions into which West Africa is divided. The low duties, for instance, in force in the German possession of Togoland and that of French Dahomey render the protection of the frontier in each case exceedingly difficult, and at any time this unfortunate state of things may lead to international complications. For this reason I would urge in the strongest terms the necessity for immediate action to be taken to secure international agreement, if only that this undoubted cause of friction may be removed, and that there may be agreement between the Powers who have taken possession of tracts of land in Africa. It can hardly be wondered at that Natives of Africa regard the profession of benevolent intentions which have been put forward with much éclat at the Berlin and Brussels Conferences as, to say the least of it, verging on hypocrisy. . . . It has often been suggested that in appealing for action we are opposing the true interests of British trade. On the contrary, it is clear that in seeking for international agreement as to this matter we are really asking for justice to British trade, as it is well known that Great Britain leads the way in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in the British possessions in West Africa, and Mr. Alfred Jones, of Liverpool, who probably has as much interest in West African trade as any other living man, supported this view strongly at the annual meeting of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee at Grosvenor House in May last. . . . It is not true, I am thankful to say, that the whole of our West African dominions are utterly demoralised by the drink traffic. Happily the evidence which I have obtained points unmistakably to the fact that only a small part of the territories under our control has been much affected by the spirit trade, as the difficulties of transport render the carriage of spirits far into the interior a difficult matter; but we have evidence that the area is rapidly increasing. With the opening up of roads and the development of railways, and the greater security of travel, drink is finding its way where it had not penetrated before. Now it is in our power to prevent the evils which are too well known in this as in other countries as arising from spirits. In a few years\' time it will be too late if the matter is not dealt with immediately. I cannot close without referring to the splendid stand made by the Royal Niger Company, who, as is well known, have prohibited the import of spirits into the greater part of their territories. From personal experience I know that this is faithfully carried out; and, though some smuggling does occur, in spite of the competition of neighbouring possessions the greater part of Niger is practically free from the evil of the liquor traffic.""', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Disturbing Public Meetings', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Well, then, after seeing such a state of things in the mountain districts, I returned to Freetown, naturally expecting that as I got nearer the capital I should find a state of things better still.

This policy avoided a head-on collision between traditional initiation and Christian missions and practice, even though the Church omitted an essential element in the girls' initiation, namely, the elongation of the clitoris, and thus failed to give malango the type of respectability that traditional initiation otherwise commanded. The Church, however, recognised the need for its' members to be at once Christians and fully initiated members of their communities, and this objective was achieved within the Church rather than in revolt against it. 14 But in the case of the Central Province of Kenya, the missionary policy towards initiation resulted in a head-on collision. The Africans had already begun to feel pressure and to harbour resentment against the British colonial administration for setting vast stretches of their land aside for European settlers. This move also coincided with the activities of a number of missions, for example the Scottish Mission (in Ukambani in 1891 and Kikuyu in 1898), Bavaria Evangelical Lutheran Mission (in Ukambani, 1893), African Inland Mission (in Ukambani, 1896), Gospel Missionary Society (in Nairobi, 1897) and Church Missionary Society and African Inland Mission (in Nairobi, both in 1901), which began to speak against the cherished traditions of the Akamba, Meru, Tharaka, Maasai and other peoples, especially that of initiation using circumcision of both boys and girls.

The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

'The local traditional religions of tropical and southern Africa - the cults of the early states - were local in character and tended to separate rather than unite', wrote Dr B. I. Sharevskaya, a Moscow student of African religions. $^{12}$ Christianity with its idea that all men are the children of God made it possible for the new converts to identify with a community larger than an ethnic group. Unity on a new basis was possible only in a milieu which marked a departure from the old forms of unity and saw no way of returning to them. The new converts were in just such a milieu. These were, as a rule, people whose break with tradition and prevailing custom was most complete. No wonder anti-colonial protest was accompanied by disenchantment with those who had brought the new faith to them, a disenchantment with the Europeans as genuine Christians and with racial discrimination in the established churches.

It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

In essence then, as Ogot has observed, 10 Owalo was not rejecting alien religions: he merely wanted the Africans to accept them on their own terms.\nEqually exciting was the message the Watchtower Church delivered to the Africans in Central Africa and southern Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in the years during and after the First World War: the world was in its last age; the great empires and nations of Europe were the instruments of Satan; so too were the historic churches. All these were to be overthrown in one last great struggle. The world would then become the inheritance of the true believers. This message was to be easily received in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where Hanoc Sindano preached, from 1917 onwards, against the authority of the colonial chiefs, colonial administra- tors, and missionaries. By 1919 the movement had entered Tanganyika, and caught on substantially in the Kasanga, Mambwe, Ufipa and Mbozi areas. Matters came to a head in 1923 when the British accused the Church's leaders of vilifying the missionary churches; seventeen men were arrested and gaoled. This did not deter the followers and the religion continued to spread throughout the colonial period.

In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

In most instances, these churches sought to incorporate a larger measure of African beliefs and practices into Christian life than was permitted in churches under missionary control. They were an expression of the desire of Africans to find 'a place to feel at home', and include African ideas of worship in their Christian liturgies. An important causative factor was the translation of the Bible into many African languages and the Africans' reading and interpretation of the Christian Scripture. On the basis of their own under› standing of Holy Scripture, Africans formed or founded their own churches, thus doing away with the monopoly over scriptural interpretation which had been in missionary hands for so long.\nThe breakaway churches, in part, represented the African reaction or adaptation to colonialism and were emancipatory in character. Especially in areas of European settlement, where political repression was intense, such churches proliferated and attracted African nationalists. The Ethiopian churches in South Africa, which emphasize African selfimprovement and political rights, are a case in point. Nehemiah Tile broke away from the Methodist Mission Church in 1882 and two years later founded the Tembu Church,$^{34}$ one of the first independent churches ever to be formed in Africa.

I was a marked man, and accused of being an enemy to my country, because I took no delight in sacrifices; but the Spirit of the Lord upheld me through all my troubles, as I will now relate to you. Many, many years ago, long before any Christian minister had ever visited these parts (the missions were established in 1832), myself and my two late companions, the late Joseph de Graft and the late John Sam, used to assemble at one another\'s houses occasionally and dip into the mysteries of the blessed Bible. My father, the late King, had permitted me to visit during my youth the then very imperfect colonial school, more with the view of satisfying my childish caprice than in the hope of my picking up any useful information. The little I learnt there I greatly, very greatly improved by help of my two friends. Myself and my two friends got regularly into the practice of having Scripture readings and prayers at our houses; and first one friend, then another, and another joined, until at last we began to have a goodly muster every time we met. Some of the chiefs and Fetish priests began to be alarmed at our proceedings, as subversive of all order and their time-honoured institutions, and took us before the Governor of those days, who cast us into prison. We were then enjoined to return to the Fetish worship of our fathers; and when we refused, we were publicly flogged at the castle gate. There are hundreds of persons still living who were witnesses of the indignity put upon us. After being confined some time, and scourged again and again, we were cast out of prison, as utterly unworthy the further solicitude of the chiefs and Fetishmen for our future welfare; and they said they must leave it with the Fetishes themselves to deal with us after our deserts. About the time we were released from prison a Bristol trading vessel arrived at Cape Coast; the master, one Captain Potter, had been trading a long time on the Coast, and was well known. We visited this good Bristolian at the house he stayed at, and requested an interview with him. We related all our troubles and trials to him, and the punishments we had undergone, and desired the good captain to assist us with his friendly advice. He told us to address a letter to the Wesleyan Methodist Society in London. He said he had a friend in Bristol, a minister of that persuasion, and he felt no doubt but that he could get the letter forwarded to London, and that our petition would be favourably considered by the managing committee. The letter was written and signed by all three of us, and handed over to Captain Potter. Some few short years elapsed, and then we saw the result of our petition to the Society in London in the advent of a missionary, **the first that had ever visited these parts;** and now, this night, we behold the mighty glory of the Lord, His power and majesty, and His overflowing love, in the sight which now presents itself to us. And this is only part of the fruit of that small seed we planted in those days.

There I could hear nothing but the war cry. Every man I approached on the subject of Christianity would answer me something about the war. I said to a great many persons that they ought to throw away their gods, serve the Great God, and become Christians, but they would generally say, ""We will see about it after the war is over."" The great multitudes scorn the cause of Christ, and serve their idols. I went with a friend to Porto Novo, a city about the same distance from Lagos as Abeokuta. The city and its country have a population of 90,000. Soon after our arrival we went to salute the King (Tofa). We found him to be a very intelligent-looking man. We told him that we came to see if he would allow us to come and live in his country, build a school and chapel, and teach his people the Christian\'s religion. He said he only knew two religions—viz., the Wesleyans and Catholics; those were enough, and he wanted no other religion in his country. We attempted to tell him that we all taught the same religion, but he soon stopped us by saying, ""I have no more to say on the subject."" He is a great tyrant, and much devoted to his gods. Just a few days before we went there he sacrificed twenty human souls to his gods. He has about three hundred wives, and told us that he had a very strict law, which prohibited us speaking to any woman or girl, as they were all his wives there. When we meet a woman or girl, we must give half of the walk and not touch them. He had a bottle of beer and lemonade brought for us to drink. After a little more talk we took a glass of lemonade and left with the understanding that we could look at his town if we let the women pass. On leaving his palace we noticed in his yard some half-dozen or more gods. These gods are to be seen by the thousands. Many of the heathen temples are decorated with human skulls, which have been offered as sacrifices to the gods. In one of these temples I counted as many as thirteen. I saw a dog that had been killed, no doubt as a sacrifice, and tied to the neck of one of the gods in the market. A German merchant there had one of the native boys to steal some money from him. He took him to the King to be punished for the deed. The King said, ""All right; I will try by one of my gods; if I find him to be guilty I will punish him."" The merchant said, ""I don\'t believe in your fetishes."" ""What,"" said the King, ""you don\'t believe in my gods!

H. Townsend respectfully and earnestly begs the assistance of all who are disposed to help in forwarding the work of Christianity and civilisation towards restoring it, and with material not so liable to take fire as native thatch is. The church was originally built by subscriptions raised in Exeter, aided by the free labour of native Christians. Services have been regularly held in it on the Sunday, two in the native language and one in English, and two services in the week. At the last Sunday service held in it before the fire, in the native tongue, the church was filled to the doors, and we have no other building capable of receiving one-half the number: it is therefore most necessary to restore the building; and to prevent the occurrence of the like accident it is thought most desirable to have an iron roof. To do this it is estimated that we shall require 300l.; a sum beyond what we can expect to raise among the native converts. Churches are not built by the Church Missionary Society; missionaries are obliged to obtain aid for such erections where they can. The native Christians have largely contributed to the restoration of the mission compound both in labour and material, and have restored the schoolroom so that it can be used as a temporary place of worship; more we cannot at present expect from them, especially as war and blockades have impoverished the country. The church was furnished with a turret clock, a bell for the clock, and another for calling the congregation together, and a harmonium, raised by subscriptions here, all of which have been destroyed; the communion plate was the only thing saved. The Rev. H. Townsend makes this appeal to the public hoping to obtain this much-needed help for the restoration of the church at Ake.—Iwe Irohin.\n\nSubscriptions are earnestly requested, and will be thankfully received by the Rev.

Even in the immediate vicinity of Lagos—viz., at Porto Novo,—the most fiendish atrocities are committed with impunity, and no restraining power would seem to be exercised by the presence of a high comparative degree of civilization at Lagos, where Christian principles have, it is to be hoped, taken deep root, and where British law demands, if it does not always succeed in enforcing, obedience to its humane provisions. And we are compelled to confess that we do not see any possible means by which the Egbas and Yorubas can be influenced in the cause of humanity other than by the gradual spread of Christianity among them. That this spread of Christianity is very gradual is, indeed, alas! but too true. Twenty years ago there seemed to be great hope of Christian progress in Abeokuta; but that hope has not been realized. There are a certain number of people professing Christianity, but these are, for the most part, without that power of authority which restrains and influences others. That a man, be he chief or king, or by whatever title he may be known, can thus dare, as in the case of the poor unhappy refugee now in Lagos, to cut off the ears and mutilate the eyelids of a slave-wife who may have offended him, and not only commit such acts with impunity, but even pursue his escaped victim with demands on the British authorities to deliver her up to him as his property, to be dealt with according to his pleasure, shows both in the individual thus acting and in the community to which he belongs an entire absence of the restraining influence of even the feeblest sense of humanity. The cruel wretch is not ashamed to claim his victim, and seems to be backed in his demand by the other Abeokutan authorities. It was almost needless to add that the British authorities could give no ear to such a demand. This question of the right of asylum at Lagos for escaped slaves has been an embarrassing one from the very day in which Lagos was brought under British rule and law. This right of asylum is like a beacon on a hill, a shining protest of Christian civilization against heathen barbarism, and must, we think, exercise some influence in restraining the slave-owners from cruelties that might lead the slaves to endeavour to escape to the free soil of Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES AND THE WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So entire has ever been our conviction that the rapid or feeble progress, the future good or evil, in West Africa depends on the character of Missionary efforts there, and of Missionary relations with the people, that it has been our constant endeavour to throw the weight of whatever influence we may possess into the Missionary scale. Whatever our individual preference may be as regards the form of Protestant Christian worship, we look upon all forms alike in the matter of Missionary effort in Africa. Church of England, Wesleyan, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, or American Episcopal, all enlist our warmest sympathies. We know nothing of Sectarianism as regards Missionary exertion among the degrading heathen superstitions which have plunged the greater portion of a vast continent into the blackest depths of human debasement. There is room there for every section of the Church of Christ to wage the Christian spiritual war against the enslaver of the nations. We wish them all God-speed. Our heart follows them in their labours, because on them the future condition of Africa mainly depends. British Government occupation and British mercantile operations have not of themselves done much, nor can they ever of themselves do much, for even moral and social progress; while as regards spiritual progress, they are entirely uninfluential. As so much, therefore, depends on Missionary exertion, we necessarily watch with extreme interest and concern the temper and conduct of European Missionaries in West Africa in their relations with natives in their own communion, in their relations with fellow-labourers of other communions, and in their relations with the heathen by whom they are surrounded. We are pained when we hear of anything that seems to us calculated to place obstacles in the way of that success which is supposed to be the aim of all Christian Missionary effort. We felt bitterly in years gone by the unfriendliness which suddenly manifested itself between the Missionaries of the Church of England and the Wesleyan Communion at Sierra Leone, when the combative impulses of our depraved human nature seemed to prevail over the peaceful, loving precepts of their Divine Master, urging brother into antagonism with brother, to the intense delight of the enemies of the Cross of Christ, and the diminution of spiritual influence among those to whom they had been sent. Although the bitterness then manifested has now, happily, ceased, and we no longer hear of wrangling between the representatives of differing communions, except in Abeokuta, there seems to us, and we write it with great pain of heart, an evil spirit at work in a way that cannot fail of being prejudicial to the success of Missionary labour. If there be not such a spirit at work, whence comes it that we hear so much of Missionary conduct and utterances which are far from exemplifying that spirit which winneth by love—that sublime spirit of the Gospel of Christ Jesus, without which, in the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles, all else ""profiteth nothing""? There must be something wrong, or we should not be troubled with the letters which reach us indicating grave dissensions in various Wesleyan Churches. We had lately to remark on the presence of evil in the Church at Bathurst; and we have now complaint upon complaint from the Gold Coast and Lagos. We are not unaware of the difficulties that may arise from peculiarities of African character and temperament, the manifestation of which may be well calculated to irritate and annoy; but, to our mind, a man who is not sufficiently under the influence of the spirit of the Gospel which he has to proclaim, to make him superior to these annoyances and irritations, is not fit to be a Christian Missionary. He has mistaken his vocation.

A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them.

In our humble opinion the arrangement proposed, backed as it seems to be with the weight of the Archbishop's position, seems to lend its sanction to this pronouncement. It looks so much like that proposed as a corrective by the Church Missionary Society in 1890, the year of the disconnexions referred to above for the future conduct of the Mission; and which practically subordinated every Native agent, whatever his position and dignity, to the control of any European secretary whom it may employ.\n\n(c) Christianity has seen about a century in West Africa generally, and yet it to this day wears the character of an exotic.

As yet, no material progress has been made among the greater mass of the people as regards Christianity, in spite of the efforts of the missionary agents, and in a population which is numbered by thousands. The number of true Christians in it is comparatively small indeed; the greater part of the people still remain in utter ignorance and darkness, and most of the upper and intelligent portion, who should show a noble example to others, do rather manifest a natural antipathy to religion, or are too proud to go to the House of Prayer.\n\nThe Sabbaths here are vilely profaned, and very often are weekdays, when drum-beating, singing and dancing are loudly carried on, even in front of the House of God, during Divine service. I have never heard of any people on the West Coast settlements, boasting as we do of civilization, and having the advantages of becoming a more Christian and enlightened people, in whom the natural propensity to worldly pleasures and enjoyments is so powerfully predominant. The aged and the young, parents with their children, males and females, are to be seen in crowds in different quarters of the town, night and day, abandoning themselves to revelry and licentiousness which it is truly painful to behold. Here are large preparations making for a grand country ball which all must attend, and at which grey-headed dames are to be seen teaching the young ones how to dance; there, in the next street, is a host of men and women, boys and girls, drinking and rioting—a funeral custom for a relation who died months ago; and in most cases of this kind a family is put in deep distress and pawned afterwards, to pay for the ruin consumed on the occasion. In another quarter of the town is a great noise of drums, and a large crowd of people gathered, to witness the wild pranks of a professional Fetish female dancer. All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Abeokuta Slave', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have known, alas! but too long, that such practices do prevail, although it is not often the evidence establishing the existence of them can be obtained or produced. We have never forgotten that it was alleged the great opposition at Lagos against the annexation of that place to the British Crown, was promoted by educated native British subjects, who could no longer be slaveholders there under British rule. But we hoped the influence of British Lagos would so prevail, and the fear of British Lagos be so felt, that in Abeokuta as well as in Lagos, no British subject, or so-called Christian, would lay himself open to legal pains and penalties and the condemnation of good men, by buying, holding, or selling his fellow-creatures as slaves. But the deposition and letter alluded to disabuse us on this head. The evil leaven seems to be there in power. Its presence is disgraceful to those educated Africans who are leavened by it. This Robbio, this so-called Christian slaveholder of Abeokuta—this seemingly pitiless master of a Christian slave—whose tender mercies to his slave seem to have been, indeed, as cruel as those of any pagan slaveholder could have been, was, we believe, some two or three years in Manchester, educating there as a mechanic and engineer. We do not recollect whether he had been a slave liberated at Sierra Leone, or was sent direct from Abeokuta for instruction. We believe, however, that he is a British subject, and if so, and that deposition be a true statement of facts, we hope that should he come within the reach of British power, he will be made an example of. It seems to us, moreover, quite clear that the indulgence to slaveholders at Lagos, of which we have so often complained, should now cease, and the recommendation of the Committee of the House of Commons be carried out by an immediate abolition of all slavery within the precincts of the colony. We hope, too, that we shall never again hear of a slave who has sought refuge there being delivered up to her former master in a heathen town, even though he be a king, and demand her on the ground of her being one of his wives, or intended wives, and promise that she shall not be punished—a promise, the value of which in such cases is less than that of a grain of common sand. And a proclamation should also issue that native or other British subjects in Abeokuta, or elsewhere in Africa (as in all other parts of the world), against whom proof may be obtained that they are holders, or buyers, or sellers of slaves will be severely punished. We recommend, moreover, to missionaries of all Christian churches to follow from henceforth the course so successfully pursued during the last two years by the Basle Mission on the Gold Coast, where no slaveholder can be admitted to be a communicant. Nothing short of a practical protest of this kind against slaveholding can suffice to eradicate this great demoralizer from among professing African Christians living in native territories.

Already have they seduced some few Liberians, sojourning at Freetown; and two, I hear, have been re-baptized by them.

It is not a denominational enterprise. It appeals for support to the friends of Christian missions in Africa, but its chief supporters are Free Churchmen and United Presbyterians. From the first it was intended that the mission should be more than a centre for evangelistic work. The aim of its promoters was to found a Christian industrial settlement, with the conversion of the natives to Christianity as its chief aim, but also seeking the introduction of civilization by the aid of commerce and industrial arts. Hitherto the mission has been remarkably successful, but the recent news shows that all the work beneficial to the natives and full of promise is endangered by the Arab slavers.\n\nThe villages destroyed by the Arabs were the following: Mweni-Mteti, Karambo, Mwandawanga, Mwaramura, Karoti, Kasangula, Mwanyongu, Malema, Karanga, Ngerenge, Fumbo, Mfuni, Chirapura, Mwaramba.
