27,Local communities in Africa demonstrated strong support and investment in religious and cultural development through broad-based fundraising efforts and active participation in both Christian and Muslim initiatives.,"The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that local communities in Africa demonstrated strong support and investment in religious and cultural development through broad-based fundraising efforts and active participation in both Christian and Muslim initiatives. The textbook highlights the role of black missionaries and the establishment of indigenous Christian churches, indicating active participation in religious development, but it does not explicitly mention fundraising efforts by local communities. It discusses the spread of Islam and Christianity, often facilitated by colonial powers, and the syncretism of African traditional religions with these introduced religions, showing adaptation by local communities. However, the absence of information on fundraising efforts is a notable difference between the claim and the textbook content. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific examples supporting the claim, detailing various fundraising activities for Christian missions, such as the annual missionary meeting at Annamaboo and the Wesleyan missionary meetings at Anamaboe and Salt Pond, which raised significant funds. The articles also highlight local contributions to the construction of new churches and chapels, such as those in Cape Coast and Ussher Town, Accra, and the involvement of local leaders in religious activities. On the Muslim side, the articles mention the opening of a mosque in Foulah Town, funded almost entirely by local collections. These examples illustrate active participation and financial investment by local communities in both Christian and Muslim initiatives. However, the articles also acknowledge challenges faced by Christian missions, such as competition from Islam and the negative influence of European traders, complicating the narrative of broad-based support for Christianity. Overall, while the textbook provides a broader historical context, the articles from The African Times offer concrete evidence of local investment in religious development, aligning more closely with the claim while also recognizing the complexities involved.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide a nuanced view of religious and cultural development in Africa during the colonial period, but they do not explicitly support the claim that local communities demonstrated strong support and investment through broad-based fundraising efforts in religious initiatives.

In the main, evangelization took the form of American black missionaries working, first, in the service of mainstream, predominantly white denominations. For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education. (Not only were some of the 'white church' evangelists black, but some white mission› aries were placed in Afro-American schools to prepare for African service.) But black church organizations of their own volition and in their own right soon became the bellwether in, arguably, the most effective missionary enterprises in Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""That the spiritual was closely linked with the social and material situation was evident in the methods they adopted. While religion necessarily remained the medium of expression of African aspirations, the concrete actions taken included labour unrest and refusal to pay taxes. Like the movements founded by Kimbangu and Mpadi, Ruben Spartas Mukasa in Uganda founded the African Progressive Association, and the Christian Army for the Salvation of Africa. An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'. Mukasa's church spread to Kenya. Of the same stamp was Jordan Msuma's Last Church of God and His Christ in Nyasaland as were the various African and Aladura churches in West Africa.\nIslam represented a counterpoise to colonial ideology as well as a forum for the expression of messianism. The Mahdï is for the Muslim as the Messiah is for the Christian. Mahdism haunted colonial authorities in North and West Africa, in the Sudan and Somaliland. The Sanüsiyya in Italian-dominated Libya, as we have seen already, presented perhaps the clearest example of the expression of African nationalism and anticolonialism through Islam. Pan-Islamism, the religious side of the culturebound pan-Arabism and the idea of the Salafiya, also played a prominent role in the nationalist and colonial politics in Egypt, the Maghrib and northern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Sanüsiyya influence as an anticolonial force spread to parts of West Africa. The colonial authorities found Islamic movements like the Hamalliyya, the Tijaniyya, and Mouridiyya a constant threat to the security of the colonial system.\nThese Islamic movements provided a strong link among adherents who found themselves under different colonial regimes. From the First World War on, as Crowder has shown above,$^{17}$ pan-Islamic ideology being disseminated from Turkey was a worrying issue to colonial authorities in many parts of Africa.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': 'In Southern Africa, even greater attention was paid to education than in other parts of Africa, thanks partly to the grants-in-aid that were given by the governments of the Cape and Natal during the period.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Christian missionary activities', 'content': ""Another effect of the introduction of the new religion was religious pluralism and, with it, the division of African societies into rival and competing factions.

There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

The greatest expansion of Islam in pre-colonial times took place in the nineteenth century, in part when Islamic militants who were dissatisfied with the intolerable accommodations Islam had made with traditional African religion declared holy wars aimed at firmly restoring the Islamic faith to its original purity. These djihäds led to the formation of theocratic states in which Islamic religion and law were imposed on the people, and this led to widespread conversions. These theocratic states extended across the Sudanic zone of West Africa from Senegal to what is now northern Nigeria, and included Futa Jallon, Futa Toro, the Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire. 4\nIn East Africa, Islam moved from the coast into the interior, but unlike their counterparts in West Africa, Muslims in East Africa appear to have been more interested in trade than in converting people to their faith. They concentrated on maintaining their trade links with the interior and perpetuating their economic spheres of influence.

The values of the two religions interpenetrate in varying degrees.

In the case oimacumba, attention should be drawn to the presence of Amerindian values, the acculturation here being of a threefold variety.\nExamples of syncretism involving Amerindian culture can be seen in the West Indies, particularly in Honduras, where a mestizo people has emerged as the result of interbreeding between Amerindian women and Africans referred to as black Caribs.$^{73}$ These Africans were the descendants of the Igbo and Efik and, subsequently, of the Fante, Asante, Fon and Congo.\nThe 'African societies' gradually turned into 'black societies', varying in the strength of their connection with Africa and in their integration in society as a whole, in the sense of gaining full citizenship.\nFrom the social standpoint, integration in society as a whole was keyed to the following variables: the type of society of the white colonizer; the form of land exploration; the religion of the colonizer - Protestant or Catholic; the percentage of Amerindians in the population and the degree of integration in the economic process imposed by the regime of the colonizer, either during the colonial period proper or following the attain› ment of independence by the Americas."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 5, 'article_title': 'GOLD COAST', 'full_section_title': 'GOLD COAST', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_02_1862#article-5', 'issue_date': '22_02_1862', 'content': 'A supposed slaver, the Manuel Orthez, from New York, for Whydah, was seized by the authorities in Cape Coast Roads on the 8th Dec.

Mr. Badcock, General Superintendent), expected here by the mail steamer due on the 22nd instant. This is not all. An institution has been opened under the management of the Rev. J. Fieldhouse, a brilliant scholar, for imparting high-class education to the youths of these settlements, and already a few young men are under training for mission work. Do all these speak against the separation? Do they show that it was a mistake on the part of the ""Parent Committee"" to have separated the Gambia Mission from that at Sierra Leone? Reason answers, No. The statement made by ""A Member"" that the Acting Superintendent imported guns and gunpowder for certain person or persons trading in the river is wholly incorrect. The case stands thus: A Mr. Owens (local preacher), who is engaged in trading operations in the upper river beyond Mr. Carthy\'s island, about 300 miles or more from Bathurst, ordered the guns and gunpowder, and advised his agent in England that those goods, together with a few packages of cotton goods, should be sent out to him consigned to the Acting Superintendent, whom he had asked before leaving for his trading port in the river to open his letters for him, and give the invoice to a Mr. Small, for him to pass the entries. This is all Mr. Adcock knows of the matter. I was present at Dobson Street Chapel when it was announced that a list was open at the Mission House to those who felt disposed to give something towards the purchase of some new lamps for the chapel, and also towards repairing the Mission premises. On that occasion it was stated that 30l. was the amount required for the lamps. It is enough to say the people did not give liberally when only the small amount of 4l. 13s. 6d. has been subscribed. Those who have contributed are entirely satisfied with the work done by the Acting Superintendent, and they thank him sincerely for it. But I must now come to the point. I must ask, and should like, to know, the unnecessary work to which the whole amount collected has been appropriated. Was it in rebuilding the outhouses in the Mission premises, a work which the Acting Superintendent never commenced until he had received the sanction of the authorities in Bishopgate Street? That building cost 128l. 19s. 2d., and the account was forwarded to England on the 19th June last. On the 8th of July, the Acting Superintendent received a reply stating that the account had been passed, and in that letter are these words: ""We are satisfied you are doing what appears to you necessary for the work, and therefore are satisfied."" The mahogany pulpit has been very admirably described by ""A Member;"" although I cannot say his description is a good one, I shall not interfere with it. I have been told that there are no documents at the Mission House in which the cost which ""A Member"" states to have been 90l., could be found; but this 90l. seems to all the chapel authorities here to be a great exaggeration. It is well to note (as ""A Member"" appears to be quite ignorant of it), that when the pulpit was taken down, it was found out that white ants had commenced to eat the wood, and a portion of it was also dry rot. It was a lucky thing, therefore, that it was taken down in time. The ""meagre husting with three stands"" that is spoken of by ""A Member,"" is a handsome rostrum, which had only been completed lately. When the rostrum was in course of erection, the people, who never saw the like before, could not understand it; but after it had been completed, they seem to like it better than the pulpit,—in fact, they have so expressed themselves. Even the refractory leader (at the meeting held for investigating the charges prepared against the Acting Superintendent, as I have before mentioned), was heard to say a few days ago: ""Now I see Mr. Adcock was right in taking down the pulpit."" No bones were brought to light or seen when the pulpit was removed; this statement is utterly false. I rejoice to find that the Acting Superintendent has the sympathy of the members, as well as that of the intelligent public. We earnestly hope he may not be discouraged, but that he will still continue to improve and strengthen the Mission at the Gambia.—I remain, dear Sir, yours truly,'}, {'id': 3230, 'article_title': 'Great Progress in the Wesleyan Accra Mission: New Chapel Building', 'full_section_title': 'Great Progress in the Wesleyan Accra Mission: New Chapel Building', 'last_edit_date': '09-15-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1876#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_11_1876', 'content': 'Sir,—Knowing the interest you take in the evangelization of Western Africa, I had thought that a short account of a most interesting ceremony recently held in connection with the work of the Wesleyan Missionary Society would give you pleasure.\n\nFor many years the above society has laboured in Accra in the face of much superstition and indifference; each step of progress has been gained by devoted toil, and the name of the late Rev.

An amount of about £421 or more was raised; one-third of the amount of course, goes to the School Board Fund, and after defraying all necessary expenses in all the churches, there was a balance of about £200 or more, which is now in the hands of the Treasurer as a reserve fund to begin the Native Pastorate. In the midst of this never yet heard of success at Abeokuta, the Bishop arrived, questioned Johnson how many slaves he had, and the native agents under his superintendence—he having met with them previous to the arrival of the Bishop, and devised plans by which they are to gradually impress on the minds of the converts the evil of holding their fellow-creatures as property, and to be disposed of at any time of need; and they did not tell him they had any. They, themselves, boldly answered the Bishop that they had none. The next day the Bishop met with the native agents, and asked them one by one, and, to Johnson's shame and surprise, they confessed to the Bishop that they had slaves and the number each one of them had. Every civilized man can picture the position in which Johnson now stands to the Bishop and the Parent Committee. A meeting was held to receive the Bishop; the Bishop, in addressing the people, used some phrases, but not with any evil intention. He said that the people must have been very rich, and have plenty of money, else they would not have neglected asking him for his annual subscription towards the School Board Fund. The people at once willingly misconstrued the Bishop's meaning, and said, Is it because they are rich they should be made to pay five strings for class, and two and a-half strings subscription towards the School Board Fund, when the Bishop, who has been helping them, is still willing to help them? Why should they, then, tax themselves (and perhaps the Bishop only gives 1l. or 2l. paid annually)? The Bishop also spoke on the subject of domestic slavery, which grieved the people very much, and they wished to know the party who exposed them to the Bishop. The native agents having suspected Johnson to be the doer, spoke their minds to the members. After this, the people would not pay their class fees, nor the subscription towards the School Board Fund. Johnson, not knowing the ill feelings of the native agents and members against him, held on fast for payment, and gave orders to the native agents to take off the names of the non-paying members from the class list.""}, {'id': 4706, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'The Mahometans had a grand day lately at the opening of their ""Mosque,"" erected at Foulah Town.

With glorious weather, and all nature around us keeping as it were a gay holiday, we realised most vividly, as we walked from the landing-place through a lovely piece of country on to the village of Yaba, the truth of Charles Kingsley\'s epigram—\'God made the country, man made the town.\' Arriving at our destination we found the quiet village all instinct with life, astir with excitement, and merry with the voices of holiday-seekers. The service began about 9.30 a.m., the audience numbering about 500. The members of the Olowoghowo Church choir were present, and, under the management of Dr. Obasa, rendered two special anthems in magnificent style."" In the centre of the church site was erected a large booth, covered in with beautifully green palm-leaves, and neath this friendly shelter from the sun\'s powerful and insidious rays the preliminaries connected with the function were gone through. Hymns were sung and prayers offered in Yoruba, and then the pastor, the Rev. J. H. Samuel, in a few pithy remarks, introduced us to the business of the day. Mrs. Bryan Roe, our chairman\'s estimable wife, laid the first stone in the name of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and beneath was deposited a bottle containing a copy of the ""Wesleyan Missionary Notices,"" and a copy of *At Home and Abroad* for September 1895, some coins of the year 1895, and a few cowries. To quote again from *The Lagos Echo*: ""The second stone was laid by Mrs. Dawudu; the bottle deposited contained a short memorial sketch of the late Mr. Hoare, concluding with the following interesting paragraph: \'This church is erected to the memory of Mr. T. C. Hoare, who, during his lifetime, was a generous supporter of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and who, by his munificence, has enabled us to erect this building.\''}]","[{'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns. We are glad to see that a prominent place is given to Africa and her children in the contemplated disposal of it. The following is from the monthly organ of the Society: ""It was deeply felt by the Committee that the hope for the evangelization of Africa must mainly rest on the employment of a native agency. The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund. In contemplation of the vastness of the field of labour in Africa it will be admitted that a large amount may with propriety be consecrated to this service.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Wesleyan Missions in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sure the following extracts from the report presented at the recent Anniversary Meeting will be perused with interest by our readers:—\n\n""For the Sierra Leone District the year has been eventful. Fire, sword, and pestilence have alike tested the faith of pastors and people. In Sierra Leone the number of conversions has been larger than for some years. In the Wilberforce Circuit, among the new converts is the son of a Mohammedan priest. In the Limbah country the Church grows in numbers, intelligence and piety. Mr. Booth has three native catechists, of whom one is conversant with Arabic. Educational work in the District is progressing. Quarterly meetings have been formed, and Circuit stewards this year for the first time took part in the business of the District Meeting. In the Gambia section earnest efforts are being put forth in order to use more effectually the waterway of the Gambia river, and thus really to take hold of the population in the interior. The people themselves have a mind both to give and to work, and so to carry the Gospel inland, to meet the power of Mohammedanism which is advancing from the interior.\n\n""For the Gold Coast District with its several sections, this is the year of Jubilee. Just fifty years ago the Rev. Joseph R. Dunwell began the Methodist Mission at Cape Coast. There are now in West Africa nearly 14,000 members, whilst thousands more have safely found their rest. The Jubilee is to be celebrated by special gatherings, and also by special gifts for the consolidation of existing missions and for extension in the regions beyond. A series of most enthusiastic meetings have already been held in the Cape Coast section of the District, and a sum of £10,000 has been promised to the Jubilee Fund. This result has filled us with wonder and gladness; and, best of all, in connexion with the same meetings, scores of the heathen have renounced their heathenism and turned from dumb idols to serve the living and true God.\n\n""The mission to Ashanti has entered upon a new era. After patient waiting for more than forty years, the door has been opened and the Gospel may now be freely preached. Kumasi, and other towns equally notorious for their human sacrifices, are now occupied. In all of them mission schools and premises have been provided by the people at their own cost. The kings themselves all regularly attend the open-air service.\n\n""In every part of the District the work is extending, and agents are wanted.

Every suppliant may put his petition into His hand, and receive an answer directly from Himself. Little children may come to Him with their hosannahs, and the aged and the helpless with their infirmities. He is in His Church, like a father in his family, to receive their testimonies of confidence and affection, and to teach and warn them in all wisdom. He is also in His Church as a Prince in his Court receiving the homage of his courtiers, and distributing his favours among them. History records that a heathen Emperor sighed over a day as lost, because on it he had conferred no favour. While we admire the generosity which awakened this regret, we can rejoice that in the administration of Him who is exalted a Prince and a Saviour not a moment is lost to mercy.\n\nLet me assure you that opinion is gaining ground in Europe that all future success in the work of christianising the heathen and Mohammedans in Africa depends on a judicious development of native agency. The work of christianising Africa can never be accomplished by foreigners; there is the language, climate, and strength against him. Nor can he think and feel as they do. He may speak to them lovingly and tenderly as only lips moved by a heart burning with compassion can speak, but it is yet the voice of a stranger.\n\nThe Native Church, thus planted and supporting itself, is determined by the help of God to conquer the evil of this place, to resist the assaults of Satan, to win souls unto Christ, and to become a grand centre of evangelisation and civilisation to the interior countries. All natives therefore must know that in this great work we are all fellow-labourers, and cannot free ourselves from its responsibilities. It is not confined to the missionaries and pastors alone; it is all, both lay and clerical.\n\nOur duty, my dear friends and countrymen, is a solemn one, for religious privileges involve also religious duties.

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African."" He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man."" Speaking of the coast tribes in the neighbourhood of our colonies at Sierra Leone and Lagos, he affirms that ""for every African who is influenced for good by Christianity, a thousand are driven into deeper degradation by the gin trade."" Passing from the nominally Christian settlements on the coast through the ""degraded cannibals"" who inhabit the lower reaches of the Niger, he arrived at the central Soudan, and says: ""The sights and scenes I there witnessed burst upon me like a revelation.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MAHOMEDANISM IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The progress of Islam forms the subject of an interesting article in the current number of *Fraser*, entitled ""Mahomedanism and the Negro Race,"" written, as we are informed in an editorial note, by Mr. Edward W. Blyden, a negro of the purest African blood, now Principal of the Presbyterian High School at Liberia, West Africa. Mr. Blyden dwells particularly upon the superiority in manliness, self-reliance, and general moral tone of Mahomedan negroes over those of their race who have embraced Christianity. For this superiority—which, he says, all observers are compelled, however reluctantly, to admit—he assigns several causes, one of which is striking and suggestive. ""The Mahomedan negro,"" he says, ""has not been exposed to the depressing influence of Aryan art."" To the negro ""the painting and sculpture of Europe, as instruments of education, have been worse than failures. They have really raised barriers in the way of his normal development.""

There is no reason to doubt a statement made in a recent number of the *Spectator* that ""the negro tribes in Africa are becoming Mussulmans fast,"" and that the converts to Islam ""are numbered by the thousand for every Christian ten."" There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual."" And Mr. Thomson\'s evidence is to much the same effect.\n\nSouth of the Equator the Arabs are Mohammedans only in name, and there the slave trade is a fatal obstacle to all improvement. Indeed, it would seem that Islam fails to exert that power over any of the races of the great Bantu family which it exercises over the true negroes of the Soudan. Here, among the higher Bantu tribes south of the Congo, seems to be the region where Christian effort seems most likely to be crowned with success. The efforts of Moffat and Livingstone among the Bechuanas show how readily they embrace and retain the teaching of Christianity. With the true negroes of Nigritia, whose cerebral development is far lower, the creed of Islam would, for the present, appear to be the highest form of faith which they can attain and retain.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage. The second example is also associated with the Scottish Free Church. A member of the Church, William Mackinnon, who owned the British India Steam Navigation Company, started running ships to Zan› zibar in 1872. A few years later he was able to convince the sultan of Zanzibar to approve his plan for building roads to Lake Nyasa and Lake Victoria.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""One of the means by which African-American black interchanges were nurtured in the colonial period, short of mass migrations, was the coming of black missionaries to 'elevate' Africa by Christian evangelism.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education. (Not only were some of the 'white church' evangelists black, but some white mission› aries were placed in Afro-American schools to prepare for African service.)

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported.

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In both cases there was only limited success, mainly due to the ignorance and presumptuous attitude of 'the experts'. 32 In Kenya and the Rhodesias the production of cash crops increasingly passed into settler hands as the twentieth century advanced. During the first decade of the century African peasant producers in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia competed with white settlers quite effectively in pro› ducing most of the grain which fed the growing numbers of wage earners. Indeed until 1914 African farmers in Kenya contributed more to the cash and export sector than the settlers. This was the period when the settlers were struggling without much success to establish themselves. At this time, too, the impact of the political economy of colonialism was relatively small. Soon the settlers and planters discovered that they could participate effectively in the production of cash crops only if they acted through the respective colonial administrations and systematically reduced the role of African producers to the minimum possible. But settler agriculture, in› efficient as it was, required an ample supply of cheap labour. As one Kenya administrator assessed the situation in 1905, 'native labour is as necessary in the development of the land as are rain and sunshine'. 33 Accordingly a number of steps - mostly imported from South Africa were taken to drive Africans to work for the white man.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

The average of the inter-war years was exceeded for the first time in 1931, then again, definitively, from 1934.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads.

Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

I do not wish to undervalue pulpit duties and good preaching, but a man that could do no more would be but a sorry workman on the West Coast of Africa. The working man who has the love of Christ in his heart, and can preach Christ in all plainness and simplicity, is the man that will find work to do for many years to come.\n\nThe last remark is full of important truth, and will go far to explain to our readers the manifold employments which fill the missionaries\' time. It must not be forgotten that on this coast there are none of the advantages of civilisation. All trade is barter; and it is only by gifts of cloth, tobacco, and the like, that the missionaries can secure the fruits of the earth for food. If they want a house, they must build it. They must be both workmen and instructors of workmen. In other lands the missionary can have all his wants supplied, if he only possesses money to purchase what he needs. In Africa, he must be his own purveyor, his own carpenter and brickmaker, and money is of no use. Thus he depends on stores from England, and on the exchanges he can effect with the natives, for his daily food. Inevitably his day is occupied with manifold secular employments, as well as with exertions for his great object—the evangelization of the people. Here the Gospel is accompanied by the arts of civilised life, and the missionary must be the pioneer of both.'}, {'id': 157, 'article_title': 'EAST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'EAST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': '05-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': 'We had intended entering fully this month into the important question of the obstructive Portuguese influences in the East African rivers.

He says: ""Yesterday the caravan of the French Expedition, with flags flying and music playing, entered Kouikouron, the capital of Unyanyembe.

The Abbé Debaize alludes to two in particular—namely, the Belgian Expedition and that of the Missionary Fathers of Algeria. As regards the Belgians, he says: ""They have experienced troubles of all kinds. At Meromero a revolt broke out in their camp. Two hundred and eighty of their men abandoned them, carrying off with them a quantity of valuable goods.

The missionaries from Algeria, who are going to establish stations on Lake Tanganyika and in the Uganda country, have not been more fortunate than the Belgians. They had to pay a ruinous sum for the right to pass through the Ugogo. They were abandoned by their native servants, and, in addition, attacked by a band of brigands, who stole several valuable chests from them.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations.

George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C. Billing, who has for so many years been interested in the Native African Church and its missionary activities, has carefully considered these proposals with Mr. Nicol.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In our closing number for 1864 we stated the necessity of increased funds, if the Society is to fight the battle of African civilization before the committee of the House of Commons during the coming session of Parliament. It has been a cause of great satisfaction to us to receive the above donations from M'Carthy's Island; and these, too, spontaneously collected by Dr. Horton before our remarks of last month had reached the Gambia. It is an encouraging fact that, with one or two exceptions, such as the Commandant, &c., all the contributors are Africans. We cannot too strongly urge upon the Africans in every part of West Africa to which this journal penetrates, that all our efforts are directed to procuring for them increased facilities and protection—for advancing their interests and the Christian civilization of their native countries. Doctor Horton suggests in his letter that the Africans on the Coast ought to contribute the 200l. a-year which the Society requires in order to give it sufficient freedom of action. If all the native traders down the Coast would make it a personal affair; if every one would for himself determine to be an annual subscriber of, say, only one guinea to the Society, and to send this subscription forward regularly, we should indeed feel stimulated anew, and powerfully stimulated, to increased exertions for them. It will be a proud day for us when we can say to the English friends of Africa, as well as to the revilers of Africa, that the African-Aid Society has an African list of subscribers, whose annual contributions render it independent of lukewarm European sympathies. Such a position would greatly strengthen our hands, both with the British Government and the British public. It will do much for us to be able to show them an educated Africa, keenly alive to its responsibilities towards those from among whom they have been brought out by the education they have received—fully alive to the necessity of those ameliorations of Government system, and those increased facilities for the development of African resources, for which we, in their interest, have ever been contending. We write freely, because we do not want one penny of their money for ourselves—but only for those disbursements necessarily attendant on public action. All we do for them is done gratuitously, in the hope of advancing God's cause in the world—and all we ask from them in return is to evince their sense of the importance and utility of our services—of those services which have really now given to West Africa a voice and a representation in Europe—by relieving us from the painful necessity of having to ask from others the small amount necessary to cover the unavoidable expenses incurred in thus serving them.

Our roof and ceiling were finished and the galleries entered upon, when I found that funds were getting low. I issued handbills on Saturday evening, calling a special meeting for Monday night, not stating for what it was called. Nobody knew about it, and curiosity was excited. The large schoolroom was filled with people, and after opening the meeting I at once told them if they wanted me to go on with the work, I must have more money. I should say that we had already collected over 200l. The people were anxious that the work should go on, of which they there and then gave practical proof. One man got up and said he would give two guineas; another, who had given me seven guineas before, gave 20l; another, who before, had given 6l. 6s., gave twenty-three guineas. This sent some of the people almost off their heads; but when the uproar had ceased promises came thick and fast. Six, five, four, three guineas, and sums ranging from sixpence, soon brought up a grand total promised (and some paid) in that meeting of over 120l. Our people have given altogether about 420l., which for us is very good, we think.\n\nThe Rev. W. J. Elliott writes from Lagos High School: ""At the close of our half-year\'s work in June all the schools were care-\n\nfully examined, the elementary day school by the native ministers, assisted by the head master, and the high school, male and female, myself. All passed off very satisfactorily, many of the pupils acquitting themselves very creditably indeed. This is the more encouraging, as we are all round considerably undermanned. As Ministers, we have just been relieved of a little of the burden which has from the beginning lain upon our shoulders, the Circuit having undertaken the entire responsibility of maintaining the elementary schools, and appointed a school board, or committee, to manage them, of course under our constant supervision as heretofore; but we have no anxiety as to the \'ways and means.\' The attendance is increasing, and we expect a great influx, as the people begin to feel that the schools are their own, and that by supporting them they are helping themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NATIVE CHURCH OF SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Revs. D. G. Williams and N. H.

I send with them a clear statement of our purpose, and especially of those circumstances which are making us feel the need of sympathy, help, and encouragement from our brethren in the Mother Church. In venturing to trouble you with a few facts, I am acting as the spokesman of all those principal Church members who assembled at Kissy Road Church, on June 2, to bid our brethren God speed; and I trust the following statement may meet the eye of many friends of Africa.\n\n(1.) This is the scene of the earliest work of the Church Missionary Society. It was led up to by striking providences. It has been costly in human life as well as in money. Not less than half a million, I believe, has been spent here. The outward and visible result is a compact Native Church of some fifteen parishes, not including the cathedral, with a native pastor, parsonage, church and school in each parish.\n\n(2.) This Church, though mainly self-supporting, is still receiving £300 per annum from the C.M.S., which is now being withdrawn at the rate of £50 per annum. We raised last year, for instance, for the Pastorate, _amongst ourselves_, £1,169 18s. 3d class pence alone producing £937 14s. 11d. This is about the average.\n\n(3.) We are a missionary Church. The C.M.S. handed over its missions to the Native Church in 1875. Our Society is called the Sierra Leone Church Missionary Society. We have two missions in the Bullom and in the Quiah country. We have two ordained missionaries with catechists under them. They cost us about £400 per annum. These missions are not making much progress; we scarcely maintain the _status quo_. We can only be said to affirm the principle of the thing. All this thickly populated region, from the far interior to our very border, is practically unevangelized.\n\n(4.) Sierra Leone is only important, financially, as a depot for trade. The Peninsula, though mountainous and fair-looking, is unproductive. A good understanding with the tribes in the interior is all that is wanted to make the Colony prosperous. We have a fine harbour, and are accessible to England, but the place by itself will neither support a Church nor even a Government. And thus I come to the ground of our plea for sympathy and help. Our importance as a Church is that we may be a depot for the interior and around. Heathen and Mahomedans trade with us, settle amongst us, and crowd our streets every day. Nothing is being done for them. Their influence on us is not for good. We are engaged in hand-to-hand intercourse, but not hand-to-hand conflict with their superstitions and sins. The result is enfeebling. We are awakening to feel our need of more spiritual power. We are planning for a general mission next dry season, but we desire to make known other needs only second in importance.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1885#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NATIVE CHURCH OF SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': '(a.) The Need of Endowment. We set on foot an Endowment Fund on the twenty-first anniversary of our existence as a Native Church, in 1883. We have raised £250 towards it. One of our Native Church members has given £1,000. Our object in raising an endowment is to set us free to appropriate all we can possibly raise annually to educational and missionary effort. At present our daily supply barely meets our daily need. The sooner our Church members and friends can endow the Pastorate the sooner shall we really be aggressive. It is a vast undertaking to raise enough money to ensure to some fifteen pastors £100 a year, but it must be done. We wish our delegates to press this matter on the minds of those who wish to see us a truly aggressive Church, and we beg our friends to understand that a very false impression exists as to native wealth in West Africa. There are a few wealthy men, comparatively speaking, but they are scattered amongst the many Christian bodies.\n\n(b.) We are resolved to improve the quality of our education, and our delegates will plead for money to enable the Native Church to set on foot a good system of training of schoolmasters. If we are to be a Missionary Church and a light to the darkness around, the training of our children must be taken up in real earnest. At present many grow up untaught, many more with but a surface knowledge, and thus with this most dangerous smattering, go off from us along the coast, miserable and unfair representatives of Sierra Leone Christianity. We profess to speak the English language in this colony, but education has much to do in this particular. (c.) And some of us are concerned further that we as a Church are training no missionaries. We have not the means. We trust that one result of the mission that is to be held will be that we shall have the young men who will gladly volunteer to ""endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ."" We wish to support a missionary who will preach to the heathen also in our streets in their own languages. For these two last stated objects Fourah Bay College (C.M.S.) is at hand and open. The Principal is ready to receive all we can send him, and to train them in both departments. We have also a C.M.S. Grammar School and a female C.M.S.

The following is from the monthly organ of the Society: ""It was deeply felt by the Committee that the hope for the evangelization of Africa must mainly rest on the employment of a native agency. The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work at the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'in the printing-office are not recognized by the other missionaries, excepting the one under whose direction he labours. Why so? Because ministerial discord and dissension are at the bottom of it. One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Native Church of Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With regard to the extension of the Mission, the Bishop has to regret that ""Sierra Leone is not at present producing either the missionaries or the pastors we require.

Since that time individual missionaries have been sent out at different intervals both from England and Jamaica. But missionary operations at present are totally insignificant compared with what they were in those times. The once flourishing mission on Fernando Po has been broken up since May, 1858, when Don Carlos Chacon\'s royal decree declared Popery to be the only religion tolerated there. A safe and quiet retreat on the continent was sought out and found, a piece of land was purchased of King William of Bimbia, seven miles from that place a small Christian settlement was commenced, named Victoria (August, 1858), and a little remnant of the broken-up church transferred to it, which remnant has been made the basis of operations, upon which a new church is now growing at a moderate pace, under the pastorate of a black missionary, who, beside his various ministerial duties, conducts a fine and flourishing day-school. Bimbia Station, seven miles from Victoria, had been almost entirely deserted. That bright light which had once burned there had about this period dwindled down to a mere spark, and would have gone out entirely but for the blessed influence of the Gospel at Victoria. Cameroons is at present the head-quarters, nominally so. The effects of missionary operations here have been in a great measure rendered ineffectual by internal discords in the church and ministry, some of which have manifested themselves in a manner which reflects anything but credit on the mission cause. Party spirits have been fostered, dissensions have been created, one especially of a most direful tendency had nearly ruined the church. It may be asked, ""What could be the cause of all this?"" Why, because the members of the church here are wholly uneducated and incapable of reasoning for themselves, and on these accounts can easily be turned about to advantage or disadvantage as the case may chance to be. Does not this circumstance reflect some disgrace on the Baptist Missionary Society, that during more than half a century\'s labour in Africa it has not been able to train up one single teacher, either in Africa or in England, capable of taking a common day-school under his own care and supervision? From Fernando Po parents have been obliged to send their children to the Church Missionary Grammar School at Sierra Leone for education. In Cameroons here the missionaries have been obliged to employ young men as teachers who can, with much difficulty spell through a verse or a paragraph, and with equal difficulty scribble a line in the most illegible hand possible, at the rate of 21l. average per annum, on the just ground that their capabilities do not entitle them to a higher salary. They have been enjoined to put aside all their other duties and attend only to those of the mission. They have promised compliance, and what has been the consequence? Their wages being so very small for the support of their families, and living so very hard, they have been unfaithful to their promise, and have clandestinely engaged either in carpentry or in the oil trade, in some instances in both. At present there is not one of them in the mission employ; they have either been dismissed or have resigned, with a view to better their circumstances otherwise. Teachers are badly wanted, and on two occasions teachers have been applied for and obtained from Victoria School (credit to the conductor of that school) for stations up here, with scarcely any remuneration beyond their feeding. One justly became dissatisfied and returned home; the other still remaining is discountenanced, and his services as a school teacher and compositor\n**35**', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—In your March number you inserted an article, ""A Ga Sabbato School"" in our town, founded by some young gentlemen.

On our small Gold Coast, with about 200,000 inhabitants, are two missions, the Wesleyan Mission and the Basil Mission; we may say three, as there is also the Bremen Mission, occupying a bordering line on the Slave Coast. We are told that it is now more than fifty years since the missionaries have been on this coast, and that the missionaries are greatly complaining of seeing no success in their work. But we found it otherwise. There is very much done in these fifty years, especially in the second to the fourth decenary. The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff.

Also, the approach of the western-educated African nationalists pre› supposed the acceptance of Western European models of political develop› ment such as nationalists without their experience could not appreciate. Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development. In several areas of colonized Africa between the two world wars, primary schools were still few and far between and secondary education was a rarity. In British Central Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Soudan and Portuguese Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, there was practically no access to secondary education before the Second World War.

He went on to say that, in his opinion, Lagos should be given up at once, and that of Gambia but one fort should be retained. Inquiry was now asked for, and it was true that inquiry had taken place in former days. Two royal commissions had sat with reference to this subject, but it was not necessary to refer to the report that had been made by the commissioners. In 1842 a select committee sat, presided over by Lord Stanley, now the Earl of Derby, and their inquiry arose principally from the fact that on the Gold Coast, which was then in the hands of a company, British merchants were in the habit of supplying slavers with requisites for carrying on their trade. The committee came to a conclusion, on which the House acted, that the Crown should resume the government of the settlement, but the question now was, whether the evil which then existed did not still continue; whether, in fact, the interest of resident merchants was not opposed to the object with which this country maintained the settlement. Committees of this House and of the House of Lords, with the more general view of inquiring into the best means of suppressing the slave-trade, subsequently sat—the inquiry which was now asked for would have the effect of eliciting whether in point of fact the maintenance of the four settlements was effectual, and how far it was so, for the suppression of traffic in slaves. For his part, he considered that the principle which was found to operate in ordinary commercial matters applied also to the slave-trade—namely, that the supply was regulated by the demand. (Hear, hear.) As long as there was an active demand for slaves, so long would there be a supply. A blockading squadron might add to the difficulty of carrying on the trade, but could not stop it. That was in fact beginning at the wrong end. The way to put down the trade effectually was to stop the demand for slaves. (Hear, hear.) He was happy to say that the demand was now confined solely to Cuba, and he believed that if pressure were put upon Spain to stop that demand, the slave-trade would be finally extinguished. It was a curious fact that the King of Dahomey saw that point much more clearly than Lord Russell did. The noble lord, in his instructions to Captain Burton last year, when that officer was about proceeding on a mission to Dahomey, said, ""Remind the King that he himself suggested that if we wished to put a stop to the slave-trade, we should prevent white men coming to buy them—(hear, hear)—and you will state that Her Majesty\'s Government, having determined that the traffic shall cease, will take steps effectually to stop the export of slaves."" The step suggested by the King of Dahomey will be found much more effectual in achieving that most desirable end than those adopted at great expense by this country. (Hear, hear.) He (Mr. Adderley) believed that before many years the Governments of America, France, and England would combine to put a pressure upon Spain that she could not resist, and that their efforts, which had been long and ineffectually made for the suppression of a nefarious system, would be followed by the adoption of a course which in one hour would crowned with success. He was glad to observe that the Spanish minister at Madrid was reported to have said that stringent measures were about to be adopted for the suppression of the slave-trade. If that promise were carried out the day was not distant—a day they would all rejoice to see—when the slave-trade would forever cease to exist. (Hear, hear.) But suppose that that day had arrived, with what object would the four settlements to which he had referred be maintained? Two objects had been assigned. One was for the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the other for the civilisation of the native races. With reference to the first, he very much doubted that the object in view would be realised by the means suggested, and he confidently appealed to the honourable member for Manchester (Mr. Bazley), and the honourable member for Salford (Mr. Cheetham), whether, representing as they did the trade associations of Manchester, they were not of opinion that the maintenance of the settlement would rather retard than promote legitimate commerce. The second was entirely a philanthropic object, and, if it could be achieved, he did not think any one in the House would complain of the keeping up of the settlement; but did the experience of the past afford encouragement for the future? In his opinion it did not. Missionary effort and voluntary action had been to some extent successful, but he was fortified by the opinion of one of the most experienced African missionaries that the existing governments planted by Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa were not any protection or assistance to missionaries. What course, then, ought the country to adopt? It was clear that we must go forward or go back; something more or less than had been heretofore done should be resolved on as the policy for the future. Either we must render our Government secure by the sending out of larger forces, the opening up of the country, the making of roads, and the extending of our power, or we must do much less than is done at present, and stand out of the way of the native chiefs, who, if we were not there, would have full control over their own subjects. The committee of 1842 led to the formation of four insignificant Governments, so small, that it might have been anticipated that they would have been jealous of each other, and instead of co-operating to effect the great object in view, were inclined rather to counteract each the operation of the other. It was, he thought, worthy of inquiry whether the present state of things should longer be allowed to exist, whether the Governments should not be concentrated, and our engagements and responsibilities contracted. On these grounds, therefore, he asked the House to grant the inquiry for which he sought, for the sake of the more effectual carrying out of the three great objects to which he had alluded—namely, the suppression of the slave-trade, the promotion of legitimate commerce, and the civilisation of the natives; be called on them to inquire whether the present system of government on the West Coast of Africa was working satisfactorily.

But we fear that the people of Liberia have been injured instead of benefited by that continual laudation of which they have been the objects, and their works in the great path of Christian civilisation the subjects. A few men, really eminent in talent and acquirements—men who might fairly challenge a high position in any civilised state—have brought a renown to her which was only deserved because they individually were worthy. And this has led those who are interested in her welfare to expect too much from her. We have heard of an emigrant population of 15,000 from the United States having brought 600,000 aboriginal natives contentedly under the steadily progressing influences of a Christian civilisation, radiating from Monrovia and Cape Palmas, until we at last believed it. Such accounts as that of the poor women whose liberation was provoked by our notice of their position, and as those which appear in our columns this month, necessarily dispel some of the illusions that have been entertained. But what then? Is Liberia, therefore, a failure? Far from it. It is only the indiscreet eulogies of her friends that have placed her in a false position, and so inflated even the sober and talented men of whom we have been writing with national pride, as to bring her into easily avoidable difficulties; such, for instance, as that with the British Government to which we lately alluded, and that new one which will undoubtedly arise out of the lawless proceedings in the matter of the wreck of the Julia Ellen near Cape Palmas. It is we and other friends who were wrong, in believing it to be possible for this emigrant population of 15,000 United States Africans, not chosen from among the most talented, educated, or wealthy, but principally from among the poor and despised—it is we who were wrong in believing that such a population, whatever its form of government, could bring 600,000 native African heathen under the restraints of civilising influences and Christian laws, or be themselves obedient to them.\n**55**', 'last_edit_date': '1870-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Lagos Mission of the Church Missionary Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I beg you will allow me space in your columns to give one more instance in support of your frequent endeavours to point out the disadvantages to which the educated Africans on the West Coast are subject by their more favoured European brethren, be they missionaries, merchants, or Government officials.

That same spirit is still at work. Under some form, varying from time to time, it has carried on its operations, for the personal benefit of some few individuals, from the period at which dear old Gerald Ralston, who laboured so zealously and so disinterestedly for Liberia, ceased to be her Consul-General in Great Britain. He threw around her poverty (how could she be other than poor?) a halo of respectability which gained for her warm and generous sympathies. The evil spirit has robbed her in great measure of these, and given her, instead thereof, shame and reproach, which are not the less keen and bitter because she does not deserve them. To the machinery which it employed Liberia is under obligation for that public loan, the proceeds of which, spent or intercepted for the most part by her false friends, have left her with a debt of which she is not able at present to pay either interest or principal, and with the odium that necessarily attaches to such impecuniosity. It is a very poor compensation to the Republic that she was toasted and extolled with disgusting inflation at so-called public banquets, which were puffed in newspapers for the self-glorification and other personal advantage of the promoters. For the sake of Liberia we had hoped that all this was at an end. But we were mistaken. We had not adequately estimated the vitality and Protean power of the spirit in question. A few days since we came upon the following in one of the public prints: ""It is said that application is to be made to the United States Congress this Session for a grant of $60,000 for the survey of a line of railway from Liberia to the interior of Africa. The object of this scheme is said to be the opening of the Soudan to civilization and commerce. Owing to the extensive purchasing and leasing of lands by the Liberia Coffee Estates Company and others during the past year, the value of land in Liberia has greatly increased, and the facility of a railway into the interior would be of unspeakable value to the Republic."" The spirit now goes about incognito. It comes upon us with a modest and retiring ""it is said."" But the destructive venom is there, and we feel that it is our duty to extract it. We see a great future for Liberia in her coffee industry. The plant with which a bounteous Nature has endowed her is a valuable one, because of its prolific and hardy properties. It has obtained a wide reputation, and we take a deep interest in it, and would not have ridicule thrown upon it, as it was thrown upon the revenue and monetary resources of the Republic, by a defaming exaggeration. We think we know something about what is going on in Liberia, but we certainly have not heard of any Liberia Coffee Estates Company, with any capital to buy up such quantities of the wide-spread public lands of Liberia as to ""greatly increase the value"" of what is so abundant. The only thing we have heard of, of which we do not know the name, is that some small drafts that were drawn by order in Monrovia on England, as payment for a transferred lease of a few acres, were returned to Liberia dishonoured. And then, as to the introduction—the preface of this astounding announcement of the great increase in the value of lands in Liberia. Somebody is to make a bogus motion in the United States Congress for a grant of $50,000 for the survey of a line of railway from Liberia to the interior of Africa. Liberia has what is looked upon as an illimitable stretch of territory from the sea-coast toward the interior. She has, however, at present only some 16,000 or 17,000 of population really termed Liberians, who are either emigrants from, or the descendants of emigrants from, the United States, although she has a large aboriginal population, which, when civilized, will be a source of great wealth and power to the Republic. She has not really any common public roads worthy the name. Her farm settlements are on the banks of her rivers, and those rivers afford all the facilities of transport that she at present requires. She could not maintain 100 miles of good ordinary road, much less railroad, if she had them. The whole announcement is a bit of superlative nonsense, if it has not some evil aim; and we should not have noticed it but that we are anxious to see an end of that abominable procession of lies which has made Liberia a laughing-stock among all who know something of, and do not love, Africa and her people, and been a cause of pain to those who do earnestly desire to see her countries march steadily in the track of civilization and Christianity to developed productiveness and wealth. What Liberia has need of is capital, and an increase of civilized industrial population; and when she has these, she will no doubt gradually spread out her arms toward the interior. She wants, too, after all that has happened concerning her and her representatives in England, to have some one of established reputation here to speak with authority in her name, and who may be applied to with confidence in such matters as this of the wonderfully increased value of her lands through the operations of some extremely wealthy company, which we can only at present think of as about as mythical as is the greatly increased value which it is said to have induced.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1878#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Another Danger than Heathenism for Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev.

One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money.""

A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—We, the inhabitants of Duke Town, Old Town, and Creek Town, are glad to see that your life is still prolonged by the Almighty Power, and that your valuable paper is still distributed along the West Coast of Africa.\n\nWe are sorry to have to denounce the conduct of one of our pastors here, whose conduct is so disgraceful amongst us and the Europeans here, for we see clearly that the other pastors are afraid to report him to their Board at home.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

In the USA, the idea of the repatriation of Africans had been mentioned occasionally throughout the eighteenth century, most notably in 1777, when Thomas Jefferson sponsored a report in a committee of the Virginia legislature. Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments. By i860, only about 15000 settlers had returned to Africa. After the Civil War, less than 2000 settlers made the trip, despite the rapid deterioration of the conditions of life for Afro-Americans in the USA.\nTwo other sources provided returning immigrants. The first came from the unknown number of maroons and Africans taken from confiscated slave ships during the nineteenth century, and shipped back to Africa by the British in their zealous attempt to terminate the trade in slaves and replace it by 'legitimate' trade. The second source of African returnees came from an even smaller number of missionaries recruited in the Caribbean and southern states of the USA, principally by the Moravians and Presby› terians, to assist in the propagation of the Christian Gospel in West Africa. The most well-known example of this is perhaps the Basel Mission enterprise among the Akwapim hills of Ghana in the 1830s and 1840s, and their decision in 1843 to use Jamaicans as substitutes for German and Swiss missionaries whose mortality in the field proved too high for evan› gelical efficacy."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

These churches were of two main types, namely, those which broke away from already existing independent churches and those which sprang up independently of any existing religious groups. In most instances, these churches sought to incorporate a larger measure of African beliefs and practices into Christian life than was permitted in churches under missionary control. They were an expression of the desire of Africans to find 'a place to feel at home', and include African ideas of worship in their Christian liturgies. An important causative factor was the translation of the Bible into many African languages and the Africans' reading and interpretation of the Christian Scripture. On the basis of their own under› standing of Holy Scripture, Africans formed or founded their own churches, thus doing away with the monopoly over scriptural interpretation which had been in missionary hands for so long.\nThe breakaway churches, in part, represented the African reaction or adaptation to colonialism and were emancipatory in character.

In the Wilberforce Circuit, among the new converts is the son of a Mohammedan priest. In the Limbah country the Church grows in numbers, intelligence and piety. Mr. Booth has three native catechists, of whom one is conversant with Arabic. Educational work in the District is progressing. Quarterly meetings have been formed, and Circuit stewards this year for the first time took part in the business of the District Meeting. In the Gambia section earnest efforts are being put forth in order to use more effectually the waterway of the Gambia river, and thus really to take hold of the population in the interior. The people themselves have a mind both to give and to work, and so to carry the Gospel inland, to meet the power of Mohammedanism which is advancing from the interior.\n\n""For the Gold Coast District with its several sections, this is the year of Jubilee. Just fifty years ago the Rev. Joseph R. Dunwell began the Methodist Mission at Cape Coast. There are now in West Africa nearly 14,000 members, whilst thousands more have safely found their rest. The Jubilee is to be celebrated by special gatherings, and also by special gifts for the consolidation of existing missions and for extension in the regions beyond. A series of most enthusiastic meetings have already been held in the Cape Coast section of the District, and a sum of £10,000 has been promised to the Jubilee Fund. This result has filled us with wonder and gladness; and, best of all, in connexion with the same meetings, scores of the heathen have renounced their heathenism and turned from dumb idols to serve the living and true God.\n\n""The mission to Ashanti has entered upon a new era.

Hymns were sung and prayers offered in Yoruba, and then the pastor, the Rev. J. H. Samuel, in a few pithy remarks, introduced us to the business of the day.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country.

Between 1858 and 1873 the CMS, UMCA and the Holy Ghost Fathers were all involved. The CMS continued to work at Rabai near Mombasa, where freed slaves from Bombay were sent to assist Rebmann. The UMCA was located in Zanzibar while the Holy Ghost Fathers worked in Bagamoyo. None of these societies had succeeded in carrying out Livingstone's mission of opening the interior for commerce and Christianity. Nevertheless, the work had begun. For, while the missions were beginning to take root on the coast, the interior of East Africa was being explored by Europeans who had been inspired by the initial efforts of these missionaries. In 1858 Burton and Speke had set out to find Erhardt's 'Sea of Unyamwezi'.$^{54}$ They reached Lake Tanganyika and Speke also visited the southern shores of Lake Victoria. In 1862 Speke returned with Grant to explore Lake Victoria, and also located the outflow of the Nile. While following the White Nile they met Samuel Baker, who had come up the river from the sea. Later Livingstone himself was to return once more to the heart of Africa, adding more to what had already been revealed. The explorations had a tremendous effect on the missionary invasion. The existence of the big lakes immediately seemed to prove the validity of Livingstone's plan. All major British missionary societies that were working in East Africa wanted to place steamers on these inland waterways. The most important stimulus derived from these explorations sprang from their revelations about the extent and character of the Arab slave trade. For it became clear that the interior was not as inaccessible as Krapf had thought of Kenya or as the UMCA missionaries had thought of the Lower Shire. Certainly caravan routes penetrated the whole interior and human cargo was getting to the coast through them. Even more significant was the revelation of what this trade implied for the lives of the Africans. . <- After Livingstone's death greater zeal was roused among British mission› ary societies. The impact of his public funeral ceremony in Westminster Abbey touched almost every pulpit and stimulated popular support for missionary work. As a result, the Scottish Free Church plunged for the first time into missionary work in Central Africa.

In 1856 he completed his second journey across Central Africa from Angola to the Zambezi delta. Prior to this period, the Church Missionary Society had sent three German missionaries to start work in East Africa. Johann Krapf arrived in Mombasa in 1844 and was followed by J. Rebmann in 1846 and by J.J. Erhardt in 1849. Their mission station was established at Rabai near Mombasa. By 1856 Rebmann had crossed the Nyika plain to Kilimanjaro to become the first European to see the mountain, and Krapf had gone farther south to visit the Shambaa kingdom of Kimweri and then north› wards to the Kamba country where he was the first European to be shown Mount Kenya. Erhardt and Krapf also travelled farther south to the mouth of the Ruvuma and later, after spending some time in Tanga, Erhardt was able to publish a map of East Africa containing a mass of information he had gathered on the coast about the interior, including the Great Lakes, which he represented as an inland sea. Erhardt's 'map was to be the main inspiration of Burton and Speke in their expedition of 1858'. 51 This first group of missionaries acted as pioneers; they gathered con› siderable information that was extremely valuable to those who followed them. Yet their information hardly came to the attention of the general public and it was only when Livingstone began his attacks on the Arab slave trade in speeches and writings that the popular imagination was caught. In the spirit of the capitalist free-trade conviction of his time, Livingstone was emphasizing the power of commerce, which, he believed, would integrate the vast interior with Christian Europe, thus relieving Africans of the poverty and humiliation caused by the slave trade. He therefore concentrated on travelling in search of navigable rivers, or what he called the 'open path for commerce and Christianity'.$^{52}$ The publication of his Missionary Travels$^{53}$ in 1857, together with his personal appeals, inspired the formation of the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) by a group of English High Churchmen.

Stanley to the Daily Telegraph inviting missions to reach for Buganda, extended its work from South Africa to present-day Tanzania; and the Catholic White Fathers, who followed the CMS into Buganda two years later.$^{9}$ Thus, by the end of our period, the missionary revolution was well under way also in East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""Another group of White Fathers left Tabora and went westwards to set up a mission station at Ujiji in 1879 and from there to Rumonge in Burundi, some 120km south of the present Bujumbura, but the station was abandoned in 1881 after the massacre of three missionaries there.

Even where there existed commercial activities, they were offshoots of missionary work. Two such examples existed. The first was the Livingstonia Central African Trading Company, which was associated with Scottish missionary activities in the Lake Nyasa region. Its aim was said to be that of supplying the mission station at Blantyre with necessities through running steamships in the waterways of the region and also that of bringing ivory for commerce at a price that would undercut the Arab merchants using slave labour for porterage. The second example is also associated with the Scottish Free Church.

The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

Partly in response to the French forward policy, the British showed no less eagerness to consolidate and defend their positions. The discovery of diamonds in 1869-70 in Griqualand West in South Africa, and the prospects of finding gold in large quantities, began to raise the fever of competition and alter the basis of the relationship between Europeans in Africa and between them and the Africans. Various European activities, hitherto pursued seemingly for their own sake or for humanitarian purposes, began to be re-evaluated from the point of view of their contribution to various European national interests. Explorers were no longer expected merely to satisfy scientific curiosity but were also encouraged to gather strategic intelligence and trade secrets. Missionaries were not just individual servants of God obeying a divine call to evangelize but were regarded as organized national agents of acculturation, part of whose objective was to weaken the cultural and commercial exclusivity of their hosts. Traders were not just seeking profit, but were preparing the way for their own nations to establish control. Thus the widespread collaboration between Africans and Europeans, seemingly to utilize Euro› pean ideas and European technologies for nation-building in the rev› olutionary situation of the nineteenth century began to be seen as subversive, contributing directly to the systematic abortion of the efforts of African leaders to reform and modernize their societies.\nIn the same vein, African rulers generally viewed the activities of abolitionists as negative. In many cases, with the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, and after resisting and stalling, they began to co-operate to the extent that alternative trade in agricultural produce, gold, ivory and other commodities came to replace the slave trade and there was no interference with the holding of slaves and other sources of enforced labour. There was thus a basis for co-operation. As noted above, increased use of slaves was the basis of that co-operation. The Europeans recognized this, but in the 1870s, while not abandoning that position, began to use emancipation as a potential factor for weakening the economic base of African states. It should be specifically noted in this connection that most of the armies the Europeans were raising were manned by emancipated African slaves loyal to their redeemers, who armed and commanded them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""In discussing the growth of European interest in the area of West Africa under review, it is useful to distinguish between two phases: that of freedom of movement for the European powers involved up to 1861 when Lagos was annexed to the British Crown, and the succeeding era of international rivalry between France and Britain with Germany entering the competition in the 1880s. This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts. European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

Previous reports are confirmed as regards the harvest prospects in this most interesting and important colony. Never, it is said, has there before been such a growing season. Never before did the crops look so green, advanced, and promising in March and April. All this is owing to a steady succession of genial rainfalls. The crop of Sugar is expected to be very large. This is very important for the colony, because Natal sugar has now become a favourite in the Australian markets. Coffee, Cotton, and all other products, look most promising, and a generally good yield is anticipated. Cotton, Flax, and other textile fabrics, are occupying attention in the colony. The average yield of Sea Island cotton will, it is said, be about 400lbs. of ginned cotton per acre. It is also now affirmed that cotton planting and sugar planting may be carried on successfully together, because at the time when labour is most wanted in the cotton fields it is least needed in the cane fields. Several patches of cotton, of a few acres each, are to be seen this year. But unless the Kafirs take to labour in the cotton fields, the labour question will be the great difficulty. The Flax that has been experimentally grown has given abundant yield, and the quality is reported as ""very good."" Wool is to become the favourite product of the upper country. There are continual importations of Sheep from the Cape, and of Rams of good breed from Australia and England. Some Alpacas are also expected from Australia. It is thought they are peculiarly suited to the hill pastures of Natal, and will give value to some of the wild kloofs of the country. Coffee planting is making steady progress.

He rode a donkey, but was subsequently carried, and thus arrived at Muilala, beyond Lake Bemba, in Bisa country, where he said, ""Build me a hut to die in."" The hut was built by his followers, who first made him a bed. He suffered greatly, groaning night and day. On the third day he said, ""I am very cold; put more grass over the hut."" His followers did not speak or go near him. Kitumbo, Chief of Bisa, sent flour and beans, and behaved well to the party. On the fourth day Livingstone became insensible, and died about midnight. Majuhara, his servant, was present. His last entry in diary was on April 27. He spoke much and sadly of home and family. When first seized he told his followers he intended to exchange everything for ivory, to give to them, and to push on to Ujiji and Zanzibar, and try to reach England. On the day of his death the followers consulted what to do. The Nassick boys determined to preserve the remains. They were afraid to inform the chief of Livingstone\'s death. The secretary removed the body to another hut, around which he built a high fence to insure privacy. They opened the body and removed the internals, which were placed in a tin box and burned inside the fence under a large tree. Jacob Wainwright cut an inscription on the tree as follows: ""Dr. Livingstone died on May 4, 1873,"" and superscribed the name of the head man, Susa. The body was preserved in salt, and dried in the sun for twelve days. Kitumbo was then informed of the death, and beat drums and fired guns as a token of respect, and allowed the followers to remove the body, which was placed in a coffin formed of bark, then journeyed to Unyanyembe about six months, sending an advance party with information addressed to Livingstone\'s son, which met Cameron. The latter sent back a bale of cloth and powder. The body arrived at Unyanyembe ten days after advance party, and rested there a fortnight. Cameron, Murphy, and Dillon together there.

Here Livingstone\'s remains were put in another bark case, smaller, done up as a bale to deceive natives who objected to the passage of the corpse, which was thus carried to Zanzibar.

Webb, American consul at Zanzibar, is on his way home, and has letters handed to him by Murphy from Livingstone for Stanley, which he will deliver personally only. Geographical news follows.

He left England about eighteen months ago to undertake an expedition on behalf of the British South Africa Company. After he reached the Shire certain modifications were made in his original plans. Accompanied by Mr. Grant, a son of Colonel Grant, Mr. Thomson made his way across the plateau between Lake Nyassa and Lake Bangweolo. He succeeded in making treaties with numerous chiefs, especially round the Bangweolo region, in favour of the Company. Of the agricultural value of the bulk of the plateau Mr. Thomson has formed a high estimate. Not only on the Blantyre highlands and on the heights around Lake Nyassa, but over the whole of the plateau he is convinced that, with reasonable care, Englishman could live and thrive as they do in India, for years together; but white colonisation, in the proper sense of the term, he does not believe possible, at least, under present circumstances. Mr. Thomson has been able to make important rectifications in the geography of the Bangweolo region. The lake, as shown in our maps, is incorrectly laid down, mainly because the one definite and precise observation taken by Livingstone has not been adhered to. The lake is really only a backwater of the Chambeze (the source of the Congo), which enters from the east, and issues from the west of the lake as the Luapula. It, in fact, lies in a very slight depression of the plateau, to the north of the Chambeze-Luapula. Even in the rainy season Mr. Thomson believes the lake does not exceed 20 ft. at its deepest. The southern shores are clothed with forests, and, as a matter of fact, his party encamped far within the bed of the lake as it is laid down in most maps. In the rainy season the water of the lake spreads out and covers for some distance the ground on which the forest stands. Mr. Thomson saw the tree on which Livingstone's men carved the record of the great traveller's death.

For three days preceding his death he had been wading through deep, marshy water, suffering at the same time from that great African enemy of life—dysentery; and he persevered until death put an end to his labours in the difficult field of African exploration. How far he has solved the geographical problems which motived his late persistent efforts, we, as yet, know not; but whether he has solved them or not, we cannot refrain from expressing our sorrow that the accomplished or attempted solution should have cost so valuable a life. For our own part, we had rather those problems should have remained unsolved for another century or two, than that he, who had already done so much for East Africa, should have thus miserably perished there, and been robbed by death of those honours and distinctions and that public esteem which would have surrounded the residue of his life with an aureole of glory. Livingstone, alas! is dead; but the great work that he inaugurated—war to the death against the atrocious East African foreign slave trade—will not perish. All that has of late been done by the British Government for its total suppression, owes its origin to the good Doctor's fearless and untiring exposure of the enormous sin and crime being daily perpetrated in those countries. If the heart of the British people has been at all stirred within them against the monster iniquity perpetrated by Arabs and Portuguese in those vast regions which they were depopulating by its practice, it was the voice and pen of Livingstone that stirred it. The influence he thus wielded for good will not have died with him. The emancipation of Eastern Africa, and its debased people, from the horrors that have held sway over and among them for many long centuries, will, sooner or later, be fully accomplished by the development of those agencies now at work with that object, and other agencies that will necessarily follow them; and when Eastern Africa attains to civilization and Christianity, one of the most honoured names—the central name on its monuments to those who have inaugurated and aided in the mighty work, will be—Livingstone."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.752, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Memorial Tablet to Dr. Livingstone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A memorial tablet, on which is the following inscription, now marks the spot in Westminster Abbey where the remains of Dr. Livingstone are deposited: ""Brought by faithful hands over land and sea, here rests David Livingstone, Missionary, Traveller, Philanthropist; born March 19, 1813; died May 1, 1873, at Chitambo\'s Village, Ulala.

The latest dates of direct information with respect to the great traveller\'s movements and whereabouts will seem to the reader unversed in African distances and delays discouragingly remote. But there is no reason, Sir Roderick Murchison urges, for alarm. Notes written by Livingstone in October and November, 1867, from Marunga and Cazembe, places which lie S. and S.S.W. of Lake Tanganyika, have been received by Dr. Kirk at Zanzibar. Livingstone, it appears, when he last wrote, had been living for three months with a friendly Arab tribe, waiting for the close of a native war, before proceeding to Ujiji, with the intention of exploring Lake Tanganyika, and thence pushing on to Zanzibar. At Ujiji Livingstone would find provisions, medicine, letters, &c., and would learn the discoveries of Sir Samuel Baker. This information, Sir Roderick thinks, would induce him to attempt the solution of ""the great problem of the Nilotic watershed of Africa, by determining whether the great lakes (Albert Nyanza and Tanganyika) are united or separated by highlands, and if separated, by ascertaining into what river-system Tanganyika discharges its surplus waters."" Ten months would suffice, probably, to complete this work and to bring Livingstone to the seacoast.

It sent out its first missionaries in January, 1878, and is consequently seven years old this autumn. Its object was to enter Central Africa by means of the great Congo, or Livingstone water-way, just then descended for the first time by Stanley, and demonstrated to be the most important and direct route into the heart of the lost continent. Its plan was to evangelise, by means of industrial mission-stations, the tribes and nations occupying the vast basin of the Congo river, and constituting at that time an almost unknown world, equalling in area the whole of the United States this side of the Rocky Mountains. Even a summary of the history of the undertaking during the past seven years, touching and stirring though it is in all its details, is impossible within the space at command. The Mission was established in connexion with no large society, with no one denomination able to supply it with ample resources; its original council was a very small one, and though some of its members were most liberal, the demands of the Mission soon surpassed its resources. The East London Institute was then led to assume the sole management and financial responsibility of the society; and despite the serious physical, financial, social, and moral obstacles lying at first in the way of the Mission, progress has been made, and satisfactory results achieved. At the outset the climate of the country proved very trying and fatal to Europeans, while the difficulties, dangers, and cost of travelling and transport were immense. Two hundred miles of cataracts and rapids made the river just where it passes through a mountainous country of no use as a highway, and the distance consequently had to be traversed on foot. Carriers had to be imported at heavy cost from a distance of a thousand miles, as the natives refused, from timidity, to act as such. Without carriers, progress was impossible in a country where money is unknown, barter goods bulky, and roads and beasts of burden alike lacking. Large outlay was consequently inevitable if the pioneers of civilization were to penetrate into the interior. The people were found to be sunk in utter ignorance and most degrading superstitions, and addicted in consequence to revolting cruelties and abominations. Their language had to be reduced to writing and systematized, and work of every kind had to be done amid incessant interruptions from sickness and death. Ten Europeans have laid down their lives in this heroic struggle during its brief course, and many others have been invalided home. Fifty brethren and sisters in all have been sent out on the staff, and yet it consists to-day of only six-and-twenty. This may give some idea of the large amount of fruitless outlay necessitated by work in such an unhealthy country.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GERMAN EXPEDITION TO AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'BERLIN, March 13.—A committee has been formed among the members of the Berlin Geographical Society, and a plan has been drawn up in conjunction with the other Geographical Societies of Germany for the completion from the West Coast of Africa of the discoveries commenced by Dr. Livingstone from the East.

We were among the last who bade Dr. Livingstone adieu the evening he left London on that final journey to Africa, and had hoped for the pleasure of welcoming him again in life and health; and it is greatly to be deplored that he so long deferred his return as to make that return alive impossible. This was, no doubt, in part owing to that spirit of perseverance which was so marked a characteristic of the devoted traveller. But there were other considerations which, we doubt not, weighed heavily with him, and these were his own decreasing powers of endurance, which would have been a great obstacle to his undertaking another similar journey, should he leave the question of the true sources of the great Egyptian river unsolved; and, alas! the almost certainty that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain funds for such a journey. From the moment we heard of his death, we have regarded him as a victim to pecuniary difficulties—difficulties not in the present, but in that possible future, which would not fail even to magnify themselves in his mind whenever it might dwell upon them.

Ten days later he was taken ill, and died at the mission station before medical aid could be given. He was buried on the following day. At Matadi, Mr. Glave stated that during his journey across Africa he had helped to suppress a great amount of slave trading, and to assist the authorities in settling ""palavers."" One interesting feature of the journey was the discovery which he made that the memorial stone sent out for Dr. Livingstone\'s grave was erected about a day\'s march from the grave itself. Mr. Glave showed photographs of Dr. Livingstone\'s place of interment to officials of the Coomassie. The grave was under a large tree, on which are carved in bold letters the names of Livingstone\'s three attendants. It is understood that Mr. Glave had many interesting manuscripts relating to his travels, which are said to be in the hands of the missionaries, along with his personal effects. Unless Mr. Glave has written out his notes, a most interesting narrative will be lost. But all his papers and photographs, we understand, are safe. The statement made that the memorial stone sent out for Dr. Livingstone\'s grave had been set up about a day\'s march from the grave itself is safe to arouse some disagreeable controversy. Livingstone, as is known, did not die in the district of Ilala, but in that of Kalinde. Mr. Thomson did not reach the exact spot, but sent his head-man to visit it. This dubiously ""trusty"" Swahili returned with a part of one of the letters which Livingstone\'s followers had cut ""in the bark"" of the ""mpandu"" (not ""a cedar"") under which they had buried their master\'s heart, &c. But Mr. Glave assured us (and sent a photograph in proof) that the inscription is not cut in the bark, but in the wood after the bark had been peeled off. But if Mr. Glave is correct, the Belgian officer who finally succeeded in fixing Mrs. Bruce\'s tablet (not ""memorial stone"") to the tree, must have been decidedly mistaken. For it seems he fastened it to a tree not ""a day\'s march from,"" but within eight miles of the right spot. If so, the circumstance of a slaver having stolen it for the metal does not matter.

The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

In Lagos, on the edge of the Brazilian Quarter, a central mosque was erected by craftsmen from Brazil (Plate 29.5).\nFurthermore, the Catholics$^{35}$ built their first church, the Holy Cross Church, started in 1879, in Lagos, and sent their children to the schools of the French and English missionaries who were beginning to use English and French for their teaching.\nThanks to the religious influence exercised intermittently by Portuguesespeaking priests from the island of Sao TomØ, the community was guided and assisted during its initial period by a freed slave known as Father Antonio.$^{36}$ The sons of Afro-Brazilians living in the Brazilian Quarter who had attended the missionary schools began to work as schoolteachers and catechists in the schools and missions that the priests of the African Mission Society were establishing in the region, without forgetting other activities such as work for the colonial administration.$^{37}$ These catechists were working for the missions, which were of European origin, and not for any educational missionary ventures originating in Brazil or resulting from an initiative of the Afro-Brazilian community of Lagos. In fact, the language of instruction was English and sometimes French.\nFor the Afro-Brazilians their Catholicism was a distinguishing feature which conferred a special social status, making them the first nucleus of an African bourgeoisie in Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Ideological protest', 'content': 'Ideological protest was seen during the period under review mainly in the religious field: among Christians, Muslims and Traditionalists.

The adherents of the Islamic religion especially in the Western Sudan belt also revived Mahdism or founded movements such as Mouridiyya led by Shaikh Ahmadu Bamba and the Hamalliyya led by Shaikh Hamallah to protest against the French presence.$^{69}$ The African Christians, especially in the British West African colonies, also rebelled against the European domination of the churches and the imposition of European culture and liturgy. This resulted in the breakaway of these members to form their own messianic or millenarian or Ethiopian churches with distinctively African liturgies and doctrines.

Essentially a spirit, God had no images or physical representations and was acknowledged as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. Power, justice, beneficence and eternity were attributed to Him, and as the Source of all Power, God had power over life and death. He rewarded men but also punished them when they went wrong and was in many ways likened to the Overlord of Society and was the Final Authority in all matters. On the whole, God was unlike human beings and was completely above His creation, but at the same time, He was involved in the affairs of men, sustaining creation and upholding the moral order. Human beings depended upon Him as a Power superior to them. God was therefore transcendent as well as immanent.\nThere was a hierarchy of spirits. Below God were the ancestral spirits, which were always treated with reverence and with awe, and then there were also the deities or gods who were believed to have the power of rewarding human beings or punishing them with misfortune, disease or even death.

It is on this ground that we call for continued and increased support. We have let in more light upon African affairs than was ever before thrown on them. But our allotted task is only begun. If we have checked some evils, prepared the way for the removal of others, and effected some real good, we regard these results as merely the first stones in our structure of African improvement. We receive from so many quarters in Africa the gratifying assurances that this journal is exercising great power for good, that we now claim from the friends of Africa, as a right, that support which we first solicited, in hope that we might possibly advance by our labours the great cause of the industrial regeneration of Africa. It is not too much to say that we have prepared the way for those commercial companies which are now coming full of promise into the great field of undeveloped African commerce. We have given Africa a voice among influential people in Great Britain. We have made her cries for help, that she can and will so richly repay, heard by those who have the power and the knowledge that are needed for successful efforts in her great fields of produce. But when we compare her gigantic evils with the elements of good directed against them, we feel that the work of her regeneration is one that demands the devotion of our life, and in which that life, by God\'s blessing, shall be spent. We can do nothing, however, without proper support. It is only by its being subscribed for, and read, that this journal can prove effective. And even so the African Times must necessarily have comparatively but little weight and influence without the effective organization of the African-Aid Society at its back; constantly available for action with Government and individuals for removing obstacles from the path of African progress; for denouncing with a voice of authority abuses which have but too long prevailed; apathy and inertia that reflect disgrace upon Great Britain as a civilized Christian power in presence of African barbarism and destructive superstition; and for pointing out the way to a better future.\n\nout measures that must be adopted, if Africa is to be raised from her degradation, and the slave-trade and slavery destroyed upon her coasts and within her borders.'}, {'id': 1951, 'article_title': 'CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR', 'full_section_title': 'CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_12_1870', 'content': ""It has been our custom at this period of the year to send our special greeting to our friends, the subscribers and readers of the African Times.

Again we shall commemorate the Advent of Him who brought life and immortality to light; again we shall, if God so will, have commenced another of those divisions of earthly time which we know by the name of years. In the one, thrusting aside the pretended discoveries of the race of mere Materialists, who would make us the adventitious offspring of self-acting particles, we shall look back with wonder, love, and praise into the divine secrets of eternity so far as they have been revealed to us in the written Word of God; in the other we shall seek to pierce into the future with our wishes, our hopes, our apprehensions, and our fears, which its swiftly-succeeding days may confirm, dissipate, or realize; comforted and strengthened, in view of the uncertainties of human existence, that ""our lives are hid with Christ in God,"" who in His due time will throw unerring light upon all the mysteries of human experience. As Editor of the African Times, we have at such seasons something more to make than mere individual retrospect and anticipation. The past and probable or possible future of our Journal not unnaturally mingle with our mere personal reflections. God has enabled us hitherto to continue its publication. For how many more years shall we be permitted to advocate in its columns the measures that seem to us best calculated to promote the moral and material progress of the African people in their difficult struggle upward from darkness to light, from the depths of loathsome superstitions to the fair plains of Christian civilization? We cannot know, seeing we are of those who ""know not what a day or an hour may bring forth."" The African Times exacts more from our heart, mind, body, and purse, much more than we dare say it ever enters into the thought of any of our readers to conceive. The area of circulation for such a paper, confined as it is to those who, from business connections with Africa, or from philanthropic motives, feel an interest in it, and to the comparatively small number of those educated in the Mission schools in Africa who are capable of appreciating the efforts made by us for the welfare and advancement of their race, is necessarily a limited one, and capable only of very gradual expansion; while the sacrifices of its Editor, mental, physical, and pecuniary, are as great as they would be if its circulation were increased tenfold, without the beneficial return which would in such an impossible case be derived. Some may think that the labour required for such a paper cannot be great. We are sorry that those who thus think cannot be made subject, for a short time, to the outlay of mind and body that it demands. The desire in our heart for the welfare and advancement of the people of West Africa is not a thing taken up by us once a month for a day or two; it is a constantly abiding, constantly active desire, occupying our thought more or less every day, and even every hour of our life, and impelling us continually to mental and bodily labour for effecting what it aims at. Even the leaders—every one of which, with one solitary unimportant exception, have been our own work alone, from the moment this paper came into existence—do not represent a moiety of those on which our mind has been engaged. Often and often have we thought over and formulated leaders for the month, only to have them rendered useless by some event or subject of more pressing importance demanding in preference our remarks. We are, of course, not forced to this, save by a sense of duty toward God, which will not allow of our sparing any labour for the more efficient performance of the work that He has given us to do. Then we have the great discouragement of being, in, alas! too many cases, defrauded of even the small amounts which our subscribers ought to pay to us. Some of our subscribers, we know, suffer reverses, which, when they have neglected paying for a few years, renders it impossible for them to pay at all. We console ourselves in those cases by the hope that the pecuniarily unfruitful copies of our paper have done good to those who received them. But there are others who, we are sorry to say, can pay, but will not pay. There is one in Sierra Leone, for example, rich and high in position in the colony, who ought to be a pattern of honesty and probity among his countrymen, who, after receiving our paper for thirteen years, without making any payment during the whole of that period, although from time to time asked for it, has met the more pressing demand of our present worthy and honorary agent with the reply that he does not care any longer to receive it, and that he will not pay. How would the late incomparable Henry Venn, who introduced this man to us as his beau ideal of an African, have stigmatized such an act! There are many other cases, we are sorry to say, almost equally bad.* Another person, in one of the West Coast towns, who undertook to collect our subscriptions for us some years ago, and received many pounds on our account, has been unable during the five or six years, if he may be believed, to turn the cowries he received into money, so as to enable him to remit it to us. We have been led into mention of these things, which are only samples, through the retrospect which the approaching season has induced, and the anticipations of the pecuniary demands which the close of the year always brings with it; as also by the mental speculation as to whether we shall find more honourable and generous treatment in the future. God alone knoweth. But one thing we do know, and this is, that we shall continue our work as long as God, by His bounty, may enable us to do so, and give us life, and health, and strength of body and mind for it. The rest we leave with confidence in His hands, who hath said, ""Cast thy bread upon the waters, and it shall be found after many days.""'}]","[{'document_title': 'Our Twelfth Year', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have usually made a few special remarks with the beginning of each new year of *African Times'* existence. We see no reason why we should not continue to do so. God has this year blessed our efforts by making them visibly instrumental to great good. When we think of the arbitrary errors of a Salmon and a Glover—of what might have been the fate of the Fanti Confederation and its oppressed officials—what might have been the fate of the bulk of those connected with the trade and commerce of Lagos but for our persistent interference in their behalf,—we do indeed rejoice at having continued this work for the good of Africa and her people. We enter, therefore, on this our twelfth year, rich in hope, and not poor in joy. Not that our subscribers pay better than they did. Never have we received so little from them as during the past year; for, to the shame of but too many of them be it said, paying is the very last thing they would seem to think of. There are good and even noble exceptions; but these are, alas! very few. To them we tender our congratulation that they comprehend and appreciate our labours for African advancement, and their own duties and obligations. We want all their aid in every way. Every educated and God-loving African has weighty duties resting upon him. He has been brought out from the mass of heathen superstition and abasement, not through any effort of his own, but under the good providence of God, by the noble and disinterested efforts of others; and this, not only for his own present and eternal good, but that he may be an instrument of good to others, who yet remain entangled by the filth and ignorance of those fiendish idolatries, which have made Africa an object of so much compassionate grief to Christian people. And Christian enlightenment ought also to bring with it a love of country; stimulating to noble and patriotic efforts to do everything possible to free it from all that is evil and degrading. Our efforts in demanding better government for the West African Settlements, and the removal of abuses there, are directed only against such things; and no Christian African ought to allow himself to be seduced by paltry pecuniary or other yet more empty considerations, into becoming an abettor, defender, and supporter of them. God helping and strengthening us, we shall not relax in our efforts; and we hope, year by year, to have to welcome new and ardent fellow-workers among the Africans themselves, and to rejoice in new successes."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Close of Our Fifth Volume', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Times has now had five full years of existence. During that period the whole of the anxiety, labour, and responsibility, both public and pecuniary, which it has involved, have been borne by one individual, the Editor. When first started, he undertook, subject to the condition of a certain number of copies being subscribed for individually by some members of the Council of the African-Aid Society, that it should never involve that society in any pecuniary loss or responsibility. Contrary to his opinion as to the conditions under which a public journal could be successfully conducted, and submitted to by him solely with the object of facilitating its establishment, a committee of a few members of the council of that society was appointed to meet monthly, prior to its publication, for considering the articles, &c., which the Editor had decided to insert. But to this the Editor attached a stipulation that he would not consent to any alterations of which he did not himself fully approve, and which he did not consider advisable or innocuous. Such a committee of course could not work, and the Editor freed himself almost immediately from the nominal restriction, which only served to increase the difficulty of bringing out the paper on the proper day, without effecting any useful purpose whatever. A perfect and entire independence of thought and opinion in the editor is essential to the success of any and every public journal. During five years, therefore, the whole labour and responsibility have, as before stated, rested with one individual, the present Editor. Such an anniversary as this is therefore a solemn one with us. The objects the Editor has endeavoured ever to keep in view have been the promotion of good government in the British African colonies and settlements, to force a removal of official abuses, to promote material development and increased facilities of transit and trade, as auxiliaries to missionary effort, and as indispensable, not to the reception of Christianity, but to the existence and spread of Christian civilization in Africa. Having entered upon this work with a deep sense of responsibility to God, we feel bound to ask ourselves how that work has been performed. With the measure and extent of its success we have nothing to do, that we leave in the hands of Him who worketh through individual agencies on the earth, according to His own infinite wisdom. But have we done our duty by the African people, and have they, on their side, done their duty towards us? As regards the former, we can only look to our motives and our desires. We have endeavoured to keep a watchful guard over ourselves as ""one who must give an account before God,"" and we have, with no small sacrifice of time and rest, conscientiously striven to give to Africa in our labours whatever talent or wisdom God may have bestowed upon us for that purpose. As regards the latter, we think we have cause of rejoicing rather than of complaint. The number of our African subscribers has continuously increased, filling up, in a way most satisfactory to us, the gaps in our subscription list caused by the withdrawals of those of our early friends who considered, we suppose, that no further effort on their part was necessary to our support. And we have given a voice—a public voice to Africa. Few people in England, unfortunately, care much about her or her concerns. The English Anti-Slavery party, fully occupied in their high and noble object of the eradication of negro slavery everywhere, have not yet had time generally to recognise the importance of paving the way, and preparing for, and aiding in the work of Christian civilization in Africa itself. Many of the few who do care about Africa have from time to time taken exception to some opinion put forth by us, and, overlooking the', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Our Seventh Year', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With this number the *African Times* commences its seventh year. We are not about to praise ourselves for anything that we have done in this work which God has committed to us. Do what we may in His cause, we must still be ""unprofitable servants."" We have, however, heartily endeavoured to do our duty; and we have been strengthened by the assurances given to us by those who are not enlisted against us by their errors or their vices, that our labours have been productive of great good. The manifold abuses and evils that still exist—the little progress towards Christian civilization and the development of the vast material resources that has yet been made, the hand-to-mouth system of administration which contents itself with to-day, and the absence of all fixed principles and definite purpose in government as regards the future, with the persistent and so far successful efforts lately made so to re-arrange the administration of justice as to secure impunity to the powerful official wrongdoer, and to withdraw protection from the defenceless and the weak, show us, however, but too plainly how small a proportion the *what has been done* bears to the *what there is still to do.* We feel what an absolute want the nascent Christian civilization of Western Africa has of the *African Times,* or some other such public monitor and guardian, in the absence of which the most pernicious errors and evils would pursue their course with unbridled head. And here our heart almost fails us. While from every settlement on the Coast we have constant cries for our help, we do not find a corresponding effort to help us in our work. Every act of administration censured, every outburst of oppression and vice exposed, creates and strengthens bitter and active animosities against us; while the supposed friendships we make are, with some few honourable exceptions, rapid and fruitless. We have seriously reflected whether we should not withdraw from this work, which costs us not only time, labour, and anxiety, but money also. The last it need not absolutely cost us, if all our subscribers in Africa would pay as they all ought to do, and as some do. But as we dare not withdraw our hand from the plough while God gives us in any way strength to hold it, we have decided to wait and see what another year of labour and anxiety will bring forth. And having thus decided, we are justified in calling upon those who ought to be our vigorous and determined friends to do their duty also. To keep our paper within the reach of all who can read, we maintain the price of subscription at 5s. a-year. But we do not hesitate to say that no one on the West Coast of Africa whom God has blessed with sufficient means, or who could pay more by the exercise of a little wholesome self-denial, ought to think he has done his duty in thus paying 5s. a-year, for which he gets every month his newspaper sent free to him, while we are *giving* to him and his fellow-Africans what three or four hundred pounds a-year would not more than adequately repay. We are compelled to write very plainly; there is a large amount of unpaid subscriptions due from the Coast, which we absolutely require for paying outlay already incurred—and now there is the new year\'s subscription, July, 1867, to July, 1868, due also. In order that we may not have to give up this work for Africa, if we can by any possibility avoid so doing, we must insist that the new year\'s subscription be immediately paid to our agents by all subscribers, or sent direct to us; while, at the same time, we call upon all our readers to make a real exertion on our behalf. Where are the 750 petitioners from Sierra Leone? Are they earnest for the full liberties of British citizens? If so, those who have influence with them in the colony ought to show them the necessity of *doing* something to obtain and to secure those liberties. Every settlement on the Coast ought to do very much more than it has yet done; and for their own sakes we now urge upon all their people the necessity of doing their duty. We desire above all things to teach them earnestness and (under God) self-reliance. No people can rise without the exercise of these virtues, however much others may be disposed to do for them. When we urge that the advanced Christian civilization of Europe ought to do much for the nascent Christian civilization of Africa, we do not mean that the Africans are to sit with their arms folded and do nothing for themselves. The civilization brought to England in the early ages would never have spread had not the Anglo-Saxons done their part too. There must be African patriotism also, if Africa is to rise; and patriotism is not a thing of words, but of deeds. Every educated African should consider it his duty to work for Africa as well as for his own individual advancement and self-indulgence. When the foreign slave-traders came to the Coast to seek their cargoes of human victims, they found Africans but too ready to help in the accursed work. Now that this great iniquity has been put an end to, let there be shown an equal zeal in Africa, among those to whom enlightenment has come, to co-operate resolutely and heartily with all those agencies, missionary or other, that come to them for Africa\'s good; not forgetting that organ of public opinion—that public guardian which no influence can rob them of if they are faithful to themselves—the independent *African Times.*', 'last_edit_date': '1867-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1867#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to African Times', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From a distinguished Christian labourer in Africa: ""From a twenty years\' African experience, I know some of the difficulties that beset your path in advocating the interests of Africa, and in seeking to promote the amelioration of her millions of inhabitants; but your path is that of truth and justice, which has prevailed, and will prevail, in doing good at home and abroad; therefore, take courage, and go on in the good work.""', 'last_edit_date': '1864-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.751, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""CHRISTMAS-DAY AND NEW YEAR'S DAY."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The year that will have closed before this paper can reach the hands of our African readers has been one marked by great and important events in Europe, which, as the chief field of Christian profession, may naturally be expected to undergo startling and terrible visitations as the world draws nearer and nearer to that end to which we have pointed. Among the political events we are inclined to regard that which has cast down thrones in Germany, and seems to be culminating in a new German Empire, as chief in menace and in promise. It has roused strong animosities, and may lead to new combinations of powers for working out those changes which are coming upon the earth. We have no prophetic spirit—we do not profess to know what even a day or an hour may bring forth; but we feel, and we hope that all our friends both in Europe and in Africa will feel with us, that these are times in which we cannot be too zealous in the performance of those works which have been given us to do. We know that our work is to bring all the forces that we can command to bear for promoting and furthering the Christian civilization of Africa. And if this duty is ours, how much more evidently is it that of every educated African. There is no hope for Africa but in that civilization, as there is scarcely an educated African anywhere who does not owe the education he has received directly or indirectly to Christian effort on behalf of him and of his race. The governing authorities would have left him everywhere in the thraldom of ignorance and degrading superstition, even when freeing him from absolute bodily slavery to his fellow-man; but various Christian organizations have, in obedience to the Divine command, come forward in his behalf and to his rescue, with results which are scoffed at and derided only by those who would have used his race for ever as victims of their interests, and of all those evil passions by the indulgence of which they who are not Christ\'s work out the devil\'s work on earth. This very fact, even supposing no love of Christ in his heart, no religious feeling to have been generated in or brought home to him with the knowledge he has received, ought not only strongly to impress every educated African with a sense of duty, but to show him clearly and unmistakably in what direction his path of duty lies. In striving to advance his own individual earthly interests, whether in science, trade, commerce, agriculture, or manufacture, let him keep constantly in view that all he has received by which he has been made to differ from the most filthy and degraded of the savages of his race, is the fruit of advancing Christian civilization, and of that alone; and keeping this in view he will not, and cannot, fail in combining with exertions for his own personal advantage and aggrandisement, equally constant and strenuous efforts for the spread of that same civilization on the continent and in the islands which he inhabits. European Christians have begun the work among the Africans, and they will not abandon it; those to whom we now write are the first-fruits of that work; but to spread widely abroad among their race the Christian civilization which has been to them individually as the breath of life, raising them up to stand before the world as fellow-men, and vindicate their claim to the equal possession with others of every land and hue of those mental endowments which divide, as by a line of eternal fire, man from the brute—to spread widely abroad this Christian civilization among their fellow Africans, is the task manifestly allotted to Africans. It is on this ground, among others, that we advocated and enforced in our last the assuming by the community of Sierra Leone of the expense of that educational work among them hitherto at the charge of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, that the funds now thus appropriated by those societies may be set free for commencing similar work in other West African districts. And it is on this ground also that we are so anxiously endeavouring to stimulate them to the production and demand among the natives of new articles for commerce. All civilization must have material resources upon which it may feed, by which it may be supported and strengthened. Christian civilization, and bodily filth and misery as the characteristics of the whole mass of the people, cannot co-exist. As the former progresses, the arts of civilization and the ameliorations of civilized existence must go with it; and these cannot go with it unless the earth is made to ""yield her increase"" by the application to it of a certain organized industry, which it will never receive except under the impulse of a trading demand. The natural riches of Western Africa are enormous, and are such as will sooner or later support a commerce to which that at present existing on the Coast is merely fractional; but for this the means must be employed by those whom God is manifestly raising up for the work. And lastly, it is on this ground that we call upon all the European employés of the British Crown in Africa to use the means and power of their position for helping on the educated Africans in that propaganda of civilization of which we have been treating.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa.

It is needless, says the Intelligencer, to recapitulate the story of the Niger Mission. The anxieties of the Committee have been mentioned in successive Annual Reports. Not a few of the agents have grievously disappointed us.

We want to see the African clergymen and leading Christian laymen rising up boldly and setting their faces openly against everything that is evil, and we are afraid it must be confessed that the more faithful a missionary or a mission preacher is in denouncing sin, the less is he popular in West Africa.

Though attempts at the planting of Christianity in the areas to the south of the Western Sudan reach as far back as the era of the Portuguese explorations in the fifteenth century, there was hardly any trace of the Christian religion left by the turn of the eighteenth century. However, from about the last decade of that century and especially during the first five decades of the nineteenth century, the situation underwent a revolutionary change. Primarily because of the evangelical revival in Europe associated with John Wesley, and the anti-slavery and humanitarian spirit of the age, born out of radical philosophies typified by the American and French revolutions, the attempt to plant and spread Christianity assumed the same dynamic if not militant form that characterized Islamic expansion in the Western Sudan. Here, initially, instead of the Ku'ran and the Sword, the Bible, the plough and commerce were the means resorted to, and the active agents were not djikâd leaders, clerics and their flag-bearers but a host of missionary societies, formed and based in Europe and America, and their African agents in Africa. Thus, whereas by 1800 there were only three missionary societies operating in the whole of West Africa, namely, the Society for the Propa› gation of the Gospel (SPG), the Wesleyan Missionary Society (WMS) and the Glasgow and Scottish Missionary Society, by 1840 only four decades later, there were more than fifteen such societies at work.

As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, there were only two missionary societies operating in the whole area. These were the Moravian Mission, which entered the Cape for the first time in 1737, withdrew only six years later and did not return until 1792; and the London Missionary Society, which appeared at the Cape for the first ime in 1799. 10 But from 1816, many societies from Britain, Europe and the USA, Protestant as well as Catholic, entered not only the Cape, but also Natal and the Transvaal.

Right from the beginning, missionaries like J. T. Van der Kemp and John Philip actively participated in politics while Lobengula, Lewanika and Cetshwayo became the great friends of Robert Moffat, François Coillard and Bishop John Colenso respectively. 12 At first, it used to be believed that the missionaries in South Africa were always on the side of the Africans and always championed their cause. Recent work has, however, emphasized that they were 'frequently employed as negotiators between colonial and African authorities, as diplomats rather than evangelists', and that though the colonists regarded them as danger› ously pro-African, many African leaders (with greater justification) regarded them as dangerously pro-settler and pro-imperialist. 13 These missionary societies did not restrict their activities to building churches, winning converts and translating the Bible into African langu› ages.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Evangelical Christianity', 'content': ""Evangelical Christianity, in whose eyes the Origin of Species was damnable heresy, had no qualms, nevertheless, in accepting its racial implications.

The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Christianity in the colonial era', 'content': 'The close association of Christianity and education cannot be over› emphasized, for it was through the innumerable schools established by missionaries that many Africans came into contact with Christianity, and in fact school was the church in many parts of Africa.

The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Increased European interest', 'content': ""Various attempts to imitate the British success in Freetown ranged from the American settlement in Liberia, the French settlement of Libreville in what is now Gabon, and the other British settlement, Freretown, in East Africa.

Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Black American evangelism in Africa', 'content': ""One of the means by which African-American black interchanges were nurtured in the colonial period, short of mass migrations, was the coming of black missionaries to 'elevate' Africa by Christian evangelism.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley. The itinerant Liberian prophet, William Wade Harris, travelled through the Ivory Coast and the Apolonia District of the Gold Coast between 1910 and 1915 and converted some 100 000 people.

He believed that there should be an independent African Church that would abolish all sectarianism, embrace all African Christians \'and make of them all one African whole\'.$^{50}$ He insisted that the African Church was to be staffed at all levels by Africans since \'European missionaries could not identify themselves with African racial ambitions and idiosyncracies\'.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power.

I am, of course, sorry to see the failure of my hopes, though through no fault of my own, and I deeply regret ever giving the slightest credence to the protestations of desire on the part of Portuguese statesmen for the civilization of Africa; for with half the labour and expense on the Rovuma we should have left an enduring mark on the East Coast of Africa; while here our footsteps have been dogged, and native emissaries employed to neutralise all our efforts. The most bitter point of all is to see this line of coast, from Cape Delgado to Delagoa Bay, left to those who were the first to begin the slave-trade, and are determined to be the last to abandon it. What a turmoil you Cape people made a few years ago about a few convicts. But fancy 900 miles of coast four-fifths slave 'preserve' and one-fifth convict settlement, and the only religious mission allowed charged 4d. a pound on calico, which they bring to purchase food at a port which they never use.

He feels as most do, that the highlands had not a fair trial, and the deaths in the lowlands are enough to prove that sedentary habits are there destructive to life. Without continual activity, we who have been exposed so long in low-lying localities, should all have been in our graves. Our last sad loss, in the Tetté journey, had neither our knowledge nor consent. The bishop likes Merambula as a fair spot for trial. We went only once to the top, and found it about 4,000 feet high. It has nice little fountains and valleys up there, and a hot fountain at the bottom. I can give no opinion about it, except that it seems as likely to be free from fever as the hills here. Everywhere a man has to take as much care of himself here in the matter of chills, wet feet, &c., as at home, and good common sense will help one more than daily doses of quinine. Now that the Church has begun a mission, it cannot be abandoned, unless it is clear that Europeans cannot live; and as Portuguese with all their terrible debaucheries survive, surely men with regular lives will live and become blessings. The anxiety felt about the means of the Society might be diminished by joining one of the great Church societies. If they retire from other than lack of health, it will be, I suppose, the first mission that ever turned tail; but I have no fears. We cannot bring the Pioneer down till the flood of December; and it being clearly the intention of our Government that she should not be abandoned, we imagine to improve the intermediate time by examining the north end of the lake. The sight of the devastation around gave me a month of dysentery, and took away all energy as to carrying the Lady Nyassa across. All was ready, part of the road made, and a waggon-load on to start; but feeling that unless some restriction on Portuguese forays on our footsteps could be put on, and some of the 'dog-in-the-manger' policy of the rivers got over, it was useless for me to risk private property to such an amount in the enterprise. If we could have stopped the enormous slave-trade of Lake Nyassa I would gladly have spent all the money I ever received. Now we shall screw her together again, and may sell her in India. I take Mokololo with me, the only reliable fellows in the country. The murders they are charged with are imaginary. Only one murder was committed, and two deaths were justifiable; of the rest I can find no evidence.

Had, now, the Governor asked the missionaries about his plan of cleansing the roads, they would have told him how to act, and the natives would not only have cleansed our new road, but they would have done what you printed in your former number, they would have completed the remainder.

But what this message may mean, is more than the whole wisdom of Pretoria can understand. The ""full solution,"" whatever that may mean, will doubtless arrive ""shortly;"" meanwhile, we exercise the virtue of patience.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting news item this mail relates to the visit that the Rev.

Coillard is accompanied by his wife, another missionary, and four other white men, three of whom are tradesmen. Among the natives accompanying him are several teachers. The whole party, travelling in four waggons and a Scotch cart, is encamped behind the present temporary Dutch Reformed Church; their camp, with its tents and buck-sails, making quite a picturesque appearance. M. Coillard is no stranger to South Africa. He has been in the country for the last 24 years, having been a long time in Basutoland, at Letsie\'s place. In 1877 he went to the Banyai country, from where he was driven away by the Matabili. Readers of Serpa Pinto\'s interesting book on his travels through Africa will recollect that one part of that work is devoted to the ""Coillard Family,"" from whom the weary traveller had received so much help and succour. Having been driven off by the Matabili, M. Coillard went beyond the Zambesi to the country of the Baroetsies, for which he and his party are now again *en route* to establish a mission there. The present undertaking had been favoured by liberal contributions from Christian friends in Scotland, England, Holland, France, and Switzerland. It may appear strange, but it is nevertheless absolutely true, that whatever is attempted in the way of bazaars, entertainments, or subscriptions in aid of the English Church fund here, is either a miserable failure, or next door to it. This was never more fully realized than during the week before last, when the long-talked-of Church bazaar was held, and the concert, which had been duly advertised, took place. The bazaar was held on the Wednesday, and, under the attending circumstances, ladies in charge must have found it no easy task to have disposed of some £116 worth of the usual ornamental, fancy, and useful articles.

He saw there what Disestablishment meant, but ""the Church was up and doing in spite of the fact that even an Archdeacon had not yet received the whole of his last year\'s stipend"": ""The lecture, illustrated by lantern slides, led to many conversations about the conditions of work in Africa. A master carpenter, for instance, came for information as to the best means of reaching Sierra Leone, and the chances of buying land there, and he stated that it was his definite intention to go there in the coming autumn. We learnt, on inquiry, that this man did the best carpentering in Antigua, and it was fully believed that he was actuated by the best of motives. Another man, a worker in leather, stated that he was going to do the same. It became very clear that the Church in Antigua was deeply conscious of its part and lot in the Rio Pongo Mission. The Rev. C. W. Farquhar\'s name acted as a talisman there. Many were most anxious to hear about him and his wife, both of whom had taught in the Mico Training School in St. John\'s. The Bishop afforded us the opportunity of meeting the clergy of the island, and after a very exhaustive explanation and discussion one elderly clergyman of colour said that if only he were younger he would offer to go himself. All were of opinion that something should be done to make the Rio Pongo Mission more effective, and, while it was felt that there was little hope of much money being forthcoming, it was agreed that nothing stood in the way of training men continuously for this great work. And as we stood up in the Cathedral, amidst a congregation of some 2,000 people, or at another time faced an equal number of young people so largely African in the same building, we felt bound to concur. Individual offers of service were made, some on the mere impulse of the moment, others perhaps with a truer comprehension of all that was involved. No immediate action was either possible or advisable, but we were thankful for every good sign.""\n\nThe Bishop\'s impressions here were of the happiest. ""As we steam away,"" he writes, ""from Bridgetown towards Jamaica, and look back on that over-populated little island, we feel that the clergy alone have it in their power to overcome the Barbadian\'s supposed distaste for leaving this island.

He unhesitatingly laid it down as the duty and wisdom of the Church in Jamaica to give of her very best to this work, and we are certain that, if the very best clergyman or layman in Jamaica had offered, the Bishop would not have said half a word to hold him back. \'If I were younger,\' said the Primate, \'I would be only too glad to go myself.\'""\n\nIt is, apparently, from Jamaica that the Bishop hopes for most fruit, and he takes care to point out that ""it would be a mistake to suppose that the account here given tells of all the results obtained in Jamaica.

It would be most unfortunate if a single word spoken should fan into flame a discontent that we saw here and there to be slumbering. Considerable anxiety was felt by some of our friends as to the manner in which we would be received by the coloured people.

Samuel Adjai Crowther, D.D., missionary Bishop of the Niger Territory, has been staying at the Church Missionary House, in Salisbury Square, London. He has come over to England upon a special mission, namely, to raise funds for the building of a new church on the Niger. The Bishop, who is a venerable-looking gentleman, now in his eighty-first year, very quiet in manner, and with all the impressive actions which belong to the negro race, has had a life full of adventure which has been almost entirely devoted to the propagation of the Christian religion among his fellow-natives. While yet a child he was kidnapped from his tribe—the Yorubas—and sold at Lagos in 1822. He was, however, rescued by a British ship, taken to Sierra Leone, and educated there by the Church Missionary Society. He was baptised in 1825, and was afterwards employed as a teacher, and in 1843, having been ordained priest, he was sent to his own country, Yoruba, to assist in the conversion of his people. In 1857 he was appointed leader of the New Niger Mission, and on St. Peter\'s day 1864, he was consecrated at Canterbury Cathedral the first Bishop of the Niger. Since that date his whole energy has been devoted to the conversion of the heathen in those regions.\n\nThe other day a representative of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ had a few minutes\' chat with the aged Bishop. ""You want me to tell you something of my work in Africa?"" said he, speaking with a sort of lisp and an accent, reminding one of a Russian speaking English. ""Well, what can I tell you. We are progressing in a wonderful manner. The white traders, who are Christians, have quite abandoned work on Sunday, and instead come to worship at our church and chapels. More, they bring the natives down from the country to worship with us. Not Christian natives, you must understand, but heathens. The traders do this. They are not missionaries, but they help us in our missionary work. At one chapel 250 of these heathens come regularly and join in the service. I am over here on a special mission, come to collect money to build a new church, which we want very much.""\n\nIt should be mentioned that Bishop Crowther was present in London last year at the Pan-Anglican Synod.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Proposed Missionary Work in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our friend, Mr. Hazeley, of Sierra Leone, long time resident at Cape Palmas, and who takes so deep an interest in all that concerns Liberia, sends us the information from Philadelphia that it is proposed to establish a missionary colony on the large Cavalla river, in Liberia, to be named ""Victoria,"" in honour of the Queen of Great Britain, to be composed of emigrants from the United States and from Barbadoes, by funds contributed in that country and in Great Britain.

George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MAHOMETANISM IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev.

Dealing, first, with European influences, Mr. Thomson says: ""It is a painful fact to admit, but there is no shirking the naked reality, that in West Africa our influence for evil enormously counterbalances any little good we may have produced by our contact with the African."" He deplores ""the small headway Christianity is making, and the aptitude of the negro to adopt all that is evil in the white man.""

These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam.""

A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

The missionaries had created an African class of evangelists, teachers, journalists, businessmen, lawyers and clerks who often seemed to accept the supposed cultural inferiority of the Africans, to accept settler colonialism as a fact of life and who admired the white man for his power, wealth and technology.$^{2}$ Examples of these individuals were Tiyo Soga (1829^71), the first African missionary to be ordained by the United Presbyterian Church in Britain, founder of the Mgwali mission where he preached to both Africans and Europeans, and translator of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress into Xhosa as U-Hambo Lom-Hambi, the first book written by an African to be published by the Lovedale Press, in 1867; John Langalibalele Dube, a Methodist minister, an ardent follower of the black American educationalist, Booker T.

Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

Another reflected the transformation of Africans from predicate to subject during the colonial period. The latter was a vision of the spiritual redemption, social recon› struction, and political reformation of African communities through the repatriation of African personnel and the energizing of African resources. Because of this vision, Africans had been educated in American schools, or sent to participate in technical and commercial activities; others were touched by American black writings or by anti-colonial ventures organized among blacks of the diaspora.

It has been suggested by two researchers on Ndebele and Shona history that the same is true of my own account of the 1896 risings in Southern Rhodesia; the British South Africa Company said the risings were fomented by 'witch› doctors'; I argued that they were powered by a profound prophetic ideology; Julian Cobbing and David Beach assert that the spirit mediums were of much more restricted influence than I allowed and that the priests of Mwari participated in the risings hardly at all.$^{29}$ It will perhaps not be found surprising that I am unready for such drastic revisions. But it certainly is true that recent work on African religion in Southern Rhodesia shows that its relationship to resistance cannot have been so straightforward as I had supposed. It is plain that neither the Mwari cult nor the system of spirit mediums was capable of committing itself wholly to resistance or wholly to anything; both were based on constant and intense competition between and within shrines; the astonishing survival of the cults depended upon the fact that priests or mediums who had backed a mistaken or defeated cause could rapidly be replaced by rivals waiting in the wings, and upon the fact that some important cult centres would always adopt positions different from others. Some Mwari shrines backed the rising and others did not, and at the shrines which did support it the families in charge were replaced after its suppression. I was wrong to suppose that the total religious leadership of the Shona would commit itself wholly to the risings; the risings were crucially important but not so important that they could - or should - disrupt the long-term patterns of persistence and effectiveness of the cults. 30 All this is relevant to the argument over the centrality of protest to prophetic movements.

Samuel Adjai Crowther, D.D., missionary Bishop of the Niger Territory, has been staying at the Church Missionary House, in Salisbury Square, London. He has come over to England upon a special mission, namely, to raise funds for the building of a new church on the Niger. The Bishop, who is a venerable-looking gentleman, now in his eighty-first year, very quiet in manner, and with all the impressive actions which belong to the negro race, has had a life full of adventure which has been almost entirely devoted to the propagation of the Christian religion among his fellow-natives. While yet a child he was kidnapped from his tribe—the Yorubas—and sold at Lagos in 1822. He was, however, rescued by a British ship, taken to Sierra Leone, and educated there by the Church Missionary Society. He was baptised in 1825, and was afterwards employed as a teacher, and in 1843, having been ordained priest, he was sent to his own country, Yoruba, to assist in the conversion of his people. In 1857 he was appointed leader of the New Niger Mission, and on St. Peter\'s day 1864, he was consecrated at Canterbury Cathedral the first Bishop of the Niger. Since that date his whole energy has been devoted to the conversion of the heathen in those regions.\n\nThe other day a representative of the _Pall Mall Gazette_ had a few minutes\' chat with the aged Bishop. ""You want me to tell you something of my work in Africa?"" said he, speaking with a sort of lisp and an accent, reminding one of a Russian speaking English. ""Well, what can I tell you. We are progressing in a wonderful manner. The white traders, who are Christians, have quite abandoned work on Sunday, and instead come to worship at our church and chapels. More, they bring the natives down from the country to worship with us. Not Christian natives, you must understand, but heathens. The traders do this. They are not missionaries, but they help us in our missionary work. At one chapel 250 of these heathens come regularly and join in the service. I am over here on a special mission, come to collect money to build a new church, which we want very much.""\n\nIt should be mentioned that Bishop Crowther was present in London last year at the Pan-Anglican Synod.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DEATH OF BISHOP CROWTHER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Samuel Adjai Crowther was a native of Africa. His original name was Adjai, and he was born about 1812 at Ochugu, in the Yoruba country, 100 miles inland from the Bight of Benin. His exact age he himself was ignorant of. His career was of the most extraordinary and romantic character. When about nine years of age he was carried off as a slave by the Eyo Mohammedans, who bartered him for a horse at Abdahda. He was again sold at Ijalu, where he suffered great cruelty; was bartered once more at Ikkeka for some tobacco and rum, sold yet again to the Portuguese, and finally captured by a British man-of-war, and landed at Sierra Leone in 1822. Together with some other captured slaves, Adjai was placed under the charge of a missionary at Bathurst, near Freetown. He was baptised into the Christian religion in 1825, taking the name of Samuel Crowther, after the then vicar of Christ Church, Newgate Street, London. In 1829 he married Asano, a native girl, who had been taught in the same school with him. Having acquired a competent education, he was placed in charge of the mission school at Regent's Town, Sierra Leone, which post he held for some years. He accompanied the Niger expedition in 1841, organised by Lord John Russell and supported by the Prince Consort. If his knowledge of native languages first attracted notice, his energy during the disasters of the voyage, his tact in dealing with the natives, and the physical vigour which he preserved amid disease and death, marked him out as a pioneer of Christianity. He was summoned to London, and was admitted into the Church Missionary College, Islington. On completing his studies here, he was ordained by the Bishop of London (being made deacon and priest in the same year, 1843), and went out to his native country, where he devoted himself to missionary labour with great zeal and enthusiasm. Here, by way of completing the romance of his life, it is said that he found and recognised his parents, from whom he had been kidnapped in his childhood. In 1854 he accompanied the next Niger expedition, and afterwards wrote an able and interesting account of the expedition. Subsequently he pursued the active life of a clergyman at Akassa, translated the Bible into Yoruba, and undertook various other literary tasks of a religious character for the benefit of his African brethren. He was widely esteemed through the Dark Continent, and had great influence over all the natives with whom he came into contact. On June 29, 1864 (being the festival of S. Peter), the former slave boy was consecrated first Bishop of the Niger Territory, West Africa, by Archbishop Longley and Bishops Sumner of Winchester, Jackson of Lincoln, Ellicot of Gloucester & Bristol, G. Smith of Victoria, and Bishop Nixon; subsequently receiving the degree of D.D. In recognition of the services which the late Bishop rendered to geography, the council of the Royal Geographical Society awarded him a gold watch in May 1880. His son, the Ven. D. O. Crowther is archdeacon of Bonny, in his late father's diocese."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.738, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DEATH OF BISHOP CROWTHER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Rock* says that ""The severe troubles lately on the Niger had cruelly lacerated the old man\'s heart. How old he actually was even he himself seemed scarcely to know. But seeing that he was rescued from a slave ship in the year 1822, he must have been past eighty. He was ordained in 1843. In 1864, in Canterbury Cathedral Church, he was consecrated Bishop, the first and only native Bishop ever consecrated by the Church of England. On that day in the choir of the cathedral was Mrs. Weekes, widow of one of the Bishops of Sierra Leone, who had received him into her house, when he was landed from the cruiser, and had taught him his alphabet. She it was who stood as one of his sponsors at his baptism, and selected for him his name, Samuel Crowther. She chose it in honour of a London clergyman of that name, in whose Sunday-schools she had been formerly a teacher. His native name was Adjai. Crowther\'s first exploit of note was connected with the latest scene of his ministry, for he accompanied the expedition up the Niger, in which the late Prince Consort was much interested. Always that river has been a source of disaster, either physical or moral, for then the members of the expedition suffered acutely from the climate, and lately the Mission has been depressed by the low moral tone of many of the converts, and of some of the African missionary agents. Yet even so pitiless a censor as Mr. Wilmot Brooke has never impeached Bishop Crowther\'s sincerity. He was, indeed, a man of singular spiritual gifts. If sometimes he was disposed to apologise for the lapses of his fellow-countrymen, this was a far nobler trait in him than could have been the Pharisaic stand-offishness of an upstart, who should have been always but too ready to point the finger of scorn at those from whom he had sprung. No story has been more romantic, or more popular with young readers, than the narrative of Bishop Crowther\'s life. There are in it plenty of anecdotes such as that when he was brought on board the man-of-war out of the slaver, his captors had frightened him so with tales about the cruelty of the English, he mistook the pyramid of round cannon balls on deck for decapitated heads of negroes. Cannon balls were globular and not conical in those days.

But whilst we have every desire to bow to his authority, yield to his wishes and follow his advice, we think it due to him and to ourselves, and to the cause which is mutually dear to us also, that he should know our reasons for desiring an independent Native Episcopate like that enjoyed by the Church of England of which the West African Churches are a part, and by its other Colonial and foreign branches.\n\n(a) The Episcopate of the late Bishop Crowther was in our humble opinion a successful one. It covered the space of twenty-seven years, whilst, before it was constituted, the Bishop who, as an ordinary clergyman had founded the Niger Mission in 1857, had always been its leader. The facts of his Mission—e.g., thousands of converts won from the most debasing kind of heathenism and idolatry, and many of them from cannibalism, infanticide and other cruel practices also; Christian congregations, churches and schools here and there in what was before a moral and spiritual wilderness; Niger born native agents among those serving the Mission and Church, and the aggressive character of the profession of Christianity by those converts, especially in the Delta, and all this within the last thirty-two years,—facts testified to by all who know the Niger, and especially by those who, from personal acquaintance with it and its people generally before the introduction of Christian missionary work into it, are able to contrast the present with the past, witness to this success. This success we respectfully submit, supplies a warrant for the continuation of the Native Episcopate.\n\n(b) The elevation of the late Bishop Crowther to the Episcopate in 1864, was declared by the Church Missionary Society—which, under God, was mainly instrumental in bringing it about, and whose servant he was, and which has from the fact of its being the honoured founder of the West African Churches held the patronage of these Churches in its own hands—to be an experiment to prove the capacity of Negroes for evangelising important sections of the African Continent by themselves and without the stimulus of the presence and supervision of Europeans, and for exercising the higher offices in the Church,—an experiment whose success was very generally desired in England, especially on account of the very heavy mortality which had always prevailed among European missionaries in the African Mission all through its long course.

In your last November number we find something respecting our island, Fernando Po. We are much grateful to you for the way you have vindicated the cause of our island as regards missionary affairs; and not only of our island, but of the African race in general. In your paper alluded to, it was said to be desired here that the Primitive Methodist Committee at home should send a European school teacher; but we do not all think thus, and I must say in plain words that the school we have at Fernando Po does not require a European school teacher, because we believe that an African school teacher is preferable to a European school teacher. An African teacher can better understand the ways, manners, and conduct of his country\'s children than a European teacher, especially in our island. Again, great men have said that if Africa should be evangelised, it would be by her own sons. Why should African young men, well qualified to teach their country\'s children in different branches of education, be put aside and a European teacher be sent for? We are confident enough that there are young men better qualified to fill the post of school teachers than such European teachers as would be sent for. Let the Primitive Committee at home observe that all down the Western Coast of Africa all schools are under the government of African young men. Let them look to Sierra Leone. There they will see a grammar-school, under the superintendence of an African clergyman as principal, whose boys are displaying his good tuition in institutions, colleges, and universities in England. The late Lord Brougham said, ""Tell me no more that the African has no mind."" The African has now established before the world that ""he has mind,"" and I feel sure that the Primitive Methodist Society would be able to find a properly-qualified and high-principled teacher in Sierra Leone for their Fernando Po school.

May their work prosper!\n\nBut it was not commendable to see how other people tried to make use of this work. Scarcely did the Rev. Shamfelt read that article than he came to seek the school. Luckily none of the ten or twelve persons whom he asked could give any information about it, and he was thus obliged to go back without having effected his object. And that was well.

But we found it otherwise. There is very much done in these fifty years, especially in the second to the fourth decenary. The missionaries know themselves how many congregations they have, and how many members of whom they cannot say that all are chaff. Besides there are lots of healthy houses built, the whole Bible, and other useful books are translated into these languages, so that our present missionaries need no more ""to pick up the languages word by word from the thick lips of the negro with great difficulty!""

We do under-rate any of their achievements for which we are and hope to be ever grateful. We are not impatient of the presence of Europeans amongst us, as we have unfortunately been too often mistakingly represented by some of our foreign friends to be; but are inviting attention to a state of things which we are persuaded they would like to see changed, and which in our humble judgment the arrangement now proposed would help to perpetuate.\n\n(d) Experience on the African Mission-field has shown that beyond a certain stage friction between European and Native Mission and Church workers is inevitable.\n\nThis may be due to national peculiarities and natural failings on both sides; to circumstances attending our relations to each other in the past; or to differences of training and the like; but whatever the cause, the fact remains, and it has exercised a depressing influence upon the work. The introduction of the European element into the Niger Mission Agency which had been all Native and the position it held towards it—a position which it was thought would be helpful to the work—was the beginning of those misunderstandings and heartburns which have occurred, and which we all deplore, and which some of us had feared would occur. We may be excused, then, if we fear that the arrangement proposed now, especially as the appointment of Native Assistant Bishops seems to be for an indefinite period, will not remove but will rather perpetuate and accentuate the evil.\n\n(e) Though the older Churches of Sierra Leone and Lagos have not yet been favoured with the Independent Native Episcopate which the Niger Delta Native Church has expressed a desire for, a desire with which we sympathise—yet it should be remembered that this Church had known none other than an independent Native Bishop who held the same Ecclesiastical status with the European Bishop of the Sierra Leone Diocese and other Church of England Bishops, and that this position was conceded to the Niger Diocese when the Mission in it was only seven years old and the Church called into existence comparatively very small, and there was no Native Church Organisation proper—an extension of which seems to be considered now by the Archbishop, as we infer from your address, a sine qua non to the renewing of this appointment.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-12-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""BISHOP CROWTHER'S SUCCESSOR."", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""which was often exercised amidst circumstances of peculiar difficulty and trial, were almost always Natives.\n\nBut attempts have been made the last few years—on account of moral weakness discovered in some of the infant Churches that have been gathered in, and serious faults in some of the agents and the like—to pronounce the experiment a failure and the Negro incapable for a responsible trust and for an independent life; and in spite of the century of training and teaching he has had, unfit still to be set free from his pupilage and the leading strings of European superintendence.\n\nWe, on our part, do not find ourselves able to subscribe to this pronouncement with the facts of the Mission to which we have already referred before us, and also the fact that some of the Apostolic Churches of which we read in Scripture were not exempt from serious faults, and that the Churches even in Europe which have been in possession of Christianity many centuries, and those in other parts of the world, do not, many of them, form an exception. In our humble opinion the arrangement proposed, backed as it seems to be with the weight of the Archbishop's position, seems to lend its sanction to this pronouncement. It looks so much like that proposed as a corrective by the Church Missionary Society in 1890, the year of the disconnexions referred to above for the future conduct of the Mission; and which practically subordinated every Native agent, whatever his position and dignity, to the control of any European secretary whom it may employ.\n\n(c) Christianity has seen about a century in West Africa generally, and yet it to this day wears the character of an exotic. It has not succeeded to root itself in the soil; to get the people generally to identify their interest and their lives with its existence and that of its institutions, and exercise towards it that devotion which they or their ancestors had exhibited towards heathenism.\n\nThere is no strong guarantee for permanence and continuity in this exotic character, and Africans who believe in the regenerating power of the religion and wish to see it cover the whole country, who have some knowledge of its fate in North Africa, after many centuries of existence, and of the complete failure of even its Roman Catholic form in comparatively more recent times after over two centuries of existence, and who are not altogether ignorant of the causes of these repeated and signal failures, are naturally anxious to see a repetition of the sad and terrible calamity avoided."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-12-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1893#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""BISHOP CROWTHER'S SUCCESSOR."", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It may be well for us to mention further that even when the late Bishop Crowther held this independent position, the way the relations he held towards the Church Missionary Society whose paid servant he was, were sometimes made to bear on him tended to prejudice the minds of Natives generally to such an extent that, when in 1887 an opportunity was offered to the Lagos and other Yoruba Churches to have a Native Bishop, they declined to avail themselves of it from this, among other reasons, that they did not desire to see another Native Bishop placed in what seemed to them the same humiliating position in which Bishop Crowther was placed, and because they did not find themselves able then to provide by themselves the stipend for such a Bishop.\n\nYou will, we are sure, readily excuse us for and sympathise with us in the fear we have regarding an appointment that would be, as it appears to us, practically inferior to that which Bishop Crowther had held. Besides, there are other considerations in regard to the Niger Episcopacy that cannot, we respectfully submit, be safely overlooked in dealing with the question of arrangements for it—e.g., the uncertain character of European life in Africa; the frequent absence from the Diocese and in Europe which the effect of the climate may necessitate; and the frequent change in the personality of the office of Bishop which this effect may also induce, and the like.\n\nWe further beg leave to mention, that the independent Bishopric which we understand the Niger Delta Native Church to desire is not one which would separate it from its Parent Church, the Church of England, which would disregard the parental interest and sympathy of its honoured founder.

His eyes were opened, and his heart and life were changed. During these long years he has lived a holy life; and you know that he is manly and honourable—universally honoured. And Wilson, too, for twenty-two years has borne the high character of a Christian man, and who, rather than remain with a prosperous business in the land where Catholicism forbids men to worship God, and substitutes the worship of images and dolls, exiled himself and family to the then wilderness of Victoria. Sacrificing all that men of this world hold so dear, can you charge him with wrong-doing? I specify these because you know them. What is to be said of that noble-hearted man, William Smith, who for years maintained the worship in Fernando Po, during my much absence, who journeyed with and for me to mountain tribes. But why further individualise? I could go on to name a hundred converts once worshipping in the Church at Fernando Po, whose Christian life showed they were freed from the disgusting vices of the ""not nice Pagan animal.""\n\n""Not nice,"" you say. No! we found Biso, a chief, at Basipu: his head covered with the ""bosuper,"" that mass of clay and fat with which those animals mat together the hair of their heads. He was painted, too, with earthy pigments, oil and ashes; with sundry snake skins, incisors of the bush-cat, bones and feathers of fowls, as ornaments round his neck, arms, and loins—the ordinary type of the Fernandian gentleman. He heard the tale of human redemption, and animal as he was, he became interested; he heard till he believed in the power and willingness of the Son of God to save him, degraded and debased as he was. He washed his skin. He worked at his farm right manfully to clothe himself and maintain his family. He became a convert, and, in after life, spent much of his time in telling the tale of mercy to his fellows in their mountain homes, and doing this for three years, unpaid, till death laid him low. He was not alone, many of the Fernandians followed him, whose Christian, manly life testified to the falsehood of the slanders heaped on native converts, and although two instances occurred where they returned to their mountain life for a time, yet I defy you, or any other man, visiting or resident at Fernando Po, to point me to a single instance of theft or drunkenness in converts from that wild race up to the time of our expulsion from the island. Wrong-doing did occur among the resident converts at Fernando Po, but it led to their immediate expulsion from the Church.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FOURAH BAY COLLEGE, SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Will you kindly allow me a small space in your valuable paper to explain my views, and satisfy my friends both here and in England with reference to the letter of ""Sierra Leonist,"" which appeared in your last issue, this month.

The letters appeared at a time, Sir, when a misunderstanding existed between the European missionaries and the native pastors, and it would convey an erroneous impression in the minds of people far and near that the native clergy wish to get rid of the European missionaries. I am therefore obliged to state, plainly and unequivocally—especially as my name is mentioned in the communication—that I do not at all participate in the views propounded by ""Sierra Leonist"" in the letter.

Such men will, we are sure, secure the confidence and respect of the native clergy. The native Church and the colony are not so far advanced in education and intelligence as to be independent of foreign aid. The supposition then, for it is nothing more, that the native clergy desire to be disconnected from their European brethren must be utterly abandoned, and cannot be maintained without injury to the native clergy. We have not been able to get a clue to the discovery of the writer. I am told it is a trick played upon the native clergy by someone, to put them in the worst light possible during the unhappy affair.

The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running.

On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Repatriation began in earnest after 1815, however, when a small group of thirty-eight black Americans led by Paul Cuffe returned to Africa. By 1830, Liberia had become the focus for a general colony of repatriated Africans, mostly ex-slaves, sponsored by the American Colonization Society with the financial support of the Federal as well as many State governments.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': 'European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour.

Repatri› ation during the nineteenth century offered few material rewards for Europeans or non-Europeans. But by 1900, the divergence between Africa and the Americas had become too great. Persons of African descent became caught up in the self-consciousness of the age which produced the type of xenophobic nationalism that all but destroyed the appeal of Africa. More› over, the interest in Africa after the end of the slave trade grew from national lusts for power and wealth - and Afro-Americans lacked both political power and the wealth needed to stimulate their own interest, or influence those who were partitioning Africa into colonial spheres. The Afro-American view became focused more on the new developments within their hemisphere. Internal and inter-regional migrations and the quest to establish the good life against new deleterious challenges absorbed their attention. The African connection faded, but did not die.

With the exception of a grant from the Liberian Legislature of 300 dols. a-year, it has been built, and is still supported, by voluntary contributions.

Though the number of patients has not been large, yet it is increasing, as the institution becomes known; and through God\'s help we have accomplished that which we proposed seven years ago—namely, the erection of a house for the sick and suffering, where they may receive help and comfort, both for body and soul. We have a kind Christian lady as the matron, and the colonial physician is the surgeon and physician of the institution. Of all our patients the seamen seem most grateful. Far away from home and friends, to meet with care and kindness, and to find the comforts of a home, with Christian sympathy; these things call out those warm and generous feelings for which seamen are proverbial. We make no extravagant outlay, but we simply desire the means to sustain this Christian home for the sick, on this unhealthy coast. There is a special work for which we now need help. We are erecting a back-building for kitchen, &c. An outlay of 600 or 700 dols. is required. The sum is small, and can easily be provided, if those who read these lines will aid us by an offering.""\n\nThis needs no comment from us.

JOSEPH THOMSON ON EUROPEAN INTERCOURSE WITH AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Joseph Thomson, the African explorer, lectured at Edinburgh, on January 11, on ""The result to the African of European intercourse."" There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND THE JUBILEE FUND OF THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Wesleyan Missionary Society have raised a large Jubilee Fund at Leeds, and other towns.

The following is from the monthly organ of the Society: ""It was deeply felt by the Committee that the hope for the evangelization of Africa must mainly rest on the employment of a native agency. The difficulties of the African languages form a barrier to the free labour of English missionaries among the African nations, and the climate of large portions of that vast continent is very unfavourable to European health and life. At the same time, on every mission in Western and in Southern Africa there have been found native converts who have been deemed suitable to be employed as teachers among their countrymen. Some of these have been honoured of God with great success. It is desired that means may be provided for the training and employment of a much larger number of native African agents; and that at important centres, hereafter to be selected, schools or institutions should be formed for that purpose, to be commenced and sustained by an appropriation from the Jubilee Fund. In contemplation of the vastness of the field of labour in Africa it will be admitted that a large amount may with propriety be consecrated to this service.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support? Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African-Aid Society and the Missionary Societies', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We alluded last month to the intimate connexion which must necessarily exist between the work of the African-Aid Society and that of the various missionary societies which are striving for the introduction and spread of Christianity in native Africa.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN MISSIONS', 'section_title': '', 'content': '[Nov. 1, 1875.\n\nus instead.

A few weeks afterwards two brethren, Grigg and Rodway, were sent out to Sierra Leone, with letters of introduction to a few Baptist friends already there, and united in church fellowship. Mr. Grigg\'s health broke down almost immediately, and he was obliged to leave the field. About two years afterwards the mission was abandoned. The ""White Man\'s Grave"" is now the not insupportable field of the agents of the Church Mission, and their increasing band of helpers. Not again till 1840 was the attempt to evangelize Western Africa seriously made, when brethren John Clarke and Dr. Prince were sent to explore the coast on or near the banks of the Niger. From the chiefs on the banks of the Cameroons they received a hearty welcome, and stations were formed there, and at Fernando Po and Calabar. In 1856 the mission at Fernando Po was ruined by the Jesuits, under the orders of the Spanish Government. A few years ago, however, the Primitive Methodists established a mission there, and it is interesting to note that they found not a few traces of the work of our less fortunate, but not altogether unsuccessful, brethren. Our mission is at present confined to the Cameroons River and the mountainous district beyond. To the Cameroons Mr. Saker went in 1843, and there he is still. His work and his self-denial have been such that when the history of them shall be told, he will rank among the foremost of the Christian heroes of our enterprise. May peace be with him in his latter days! In 1864 our brother Thompson went out, and after several years\' work at different stations on the coast of the river, he, about two years ago, established a station in the Cameroons Mountain, where it is confidently hoped he will soon gain access to the many villages and tribes that inhabit that populous region. At present there are ten stations, with 148 members, seven day-schools, and four Sunday-schools. The difficulties to be overcome in this mission have been very great; not the least being the necessity of providing the people with written languages. Mr. Saker has translated the Word of God in the Dualla, and has compiled a dictionary and hymn-book.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction. He might be disposed to join with such as demanded their withdrawal from Africa if it were not that on all sides he saw signs of hope, signs of the approach of a brighter day and of brighter things for the negro. With missionary enterprise starting forth on a more promising career of Christian conquest, with commerce purging itself of its criminal iniquities and joining with religion in the work of civilisation, what might not be predicted of the future of Africa? Already these remote corners had heard the glad tidings of the coming good—in a still small voice perhaps, and possibly unheeded, uncomprehended, but bound to catch the heathen ear at last, and grow in form, in volume, in harmony till it swelled into one grand paean and Christian hymn, which would be heard in every African forest depth and wild waste of jungle.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Capabilities of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Brother in the cause of God and humanity,—The elevation of Africa is near my heart, and anything that promises to aid in rescuing her from her long and deep degradation meets a warm response in my heart.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

The swarthy races in Africa have not done their part in this great work to which the Creator appointed mankind. It has yet to be accomplished, and the time seems now to be at hand for it to commence. The fringe of the continent has been touched at divers places by the hand of civilization, but only, so far, to show how lamentably inadequate and inoperative were the means hitherto employed. We shall not particularize, because the fact is patent to every one. The agencies now at work seem, however, to promise much more extensive and satisfactory results. We had intended to enter largely on their consideration this month, but although we place before our readers a portion of the public intelligence relating to them, we have determined to postpone that consideration at least until our next number. The spirit of civilized progress now claiming Africa has put forth its claims with so much vigour, at so many points, and in so many diverse ways; the public attention and interest are invited and demanded so persistently and forcibly; the torpor of the African peoples if left to themselves, and their utter inability of themselves, or by the aid of mere trading or missionary effort, to make even the smallest advances towards civilization and Christianity, has become so incontestable,—that we look forward now confidently not only to a continuance of mercantile enterprise and the efforts of Christian philanthropy in its yearning for African souls, but to the speedy operation, also, of Governments and associations in furtherance of those claims.

They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

This developed new productive capacities that made slave labour less profitable and therefore produced new attitudes towards the slave trade.

Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade.

Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions.

After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast.

From the earliest days of the process of presenting Christianity to Africans, some converts had accepted the new faith lock, stock, and barrel. Others, on the other hand, accepted it on the basis of what they already knew, and understood Christianity in terms of the basic underlying concepts of African traditional religion, relating the message of the Church to their enduring religious needs.\nThus Christianity did not come merely to supplant traditional religious beliefs and practices, rather it came to supplement them. In other words, some African Christians used certain aspects of Christianity to strengthen aspects of traditional beliefs that needed strengthening, and at the same time used traditional beliefs to strengthen aspects of Christianity where they were found wanting. Thus they came out with what they sincerely believed to be a meaningful religion, and their Christianity can be seen as an expression of the African way of being religious. This is why we have termed it indigenous Christianity.\nUnderlying indigenous Christianity is an expression of religious crea› tivity and cultural integrity, and not a mere reaction, response or adaptation to outside stimuli, as some scholars are wont to assert. Usually, and with a few exceptions, the explanation for the emergence and proliferation of movements of indigenous Christianity has been derived from factors outside these movements themselves which has given them a functional reasonableness or a dysfunctional aberrant quality. Such interpretations may not be devoid of validity but they tend to overstress the role of outside factors in the emergence of these movements. Thus when they are called 'independent' churches, the underlying suggestion is that there is some more important reference point outside these churches.\nHaving taken the bold step of grafting Christianity on to the African 38.

Like the movements founded by Kimbangu and Mpadi, Ruben Spartas Mukasa in Uganda founded the African Progressive Association, and the Christian Army for the Salvation of Africa. An ex-serviceman in the King's African Rifles, Mukasa gave expression to the unifying purpose of all these movements when he promised to work for the redemption of Africa at whatever personal risks. When he started a branch of the African Orthodox Church in Uganda, the political and social purpose was clear in his declaration that the Church was '... for all right-thinking Africans, men who wish to be free in their own house, not always being thought of as boys'. Mukasa's church spread to Kenya. Of the same stamp was Jordan Msuma's Last Church of God and His Christ in Nyasaland as were the various African and Aladura churches in West Africa.\nIslam represented a counterpoise to colonial ideology as well as a forum for the expression of messianism. The Mahdï is for the Muslim as the Messiah is for the Christian. Mahdism haunted colonial authorities in North and West Africa, in the Sudan and Somaliland. The Sanüsiyya in Italian-dominated Libya, as we have seen already, presented perhaps the clearest example of the expression of African nationalism and anticolonialism through Islam. Pan-Islamism, the religious side of the culturebound pan-Arabism and the idea of the Salafiya, also played a prominent role in the nationalist and colonial politics in Egypt, the Maghrib and northern Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The Sanüsiyya influence as an anticolonial force spread to parts of West Africa. The colonial authorities found Islamic movements like the Hamalliyya, the Tijaniyya, and Mouridiyya a constant threat to the security of the colonial system.\nThese Islamic movements provided a strong link among adherents who found themselves under different colonial regimes.

The djihäd states took a great interest in promoting agriculture, partly through traditional household production, partly also through estates worked by slave or client labour. They also promoted industrial manufacture and trade. They improved trade routes and offered protection to traders and merchants. By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange.

The objects of the Association have been so strangely misconstrued, and its acts so palpably misrepresented, by writers in the British as well as Continental Press, that contradiction on certain heads appears imperative. I select two of the more important charges. First, ""It seems rather difficult to understand,"" we are told, ""how the natives can be civilized, or commerce introduced, at the point of the bayonet."" Now no single station of the Association can be said to have been established by force. The means used have been purely pacific; and if at any time collision has occurred with natives, the occurrence must be held as exceptional, of a local character, and in no way affecting the general principles of action. Secondly, objection has been urged to the stringency of particular treaties made with the native chiefs, because the terms used lead to the belief that territory acquired by the Association will be considered ground on which to levy tolls and customs, and generally impede free trade. In reality, the Association has no intention whatever to enclose its free stations with any line of ""douane."" On the contrary, it is ready to pledge itself, to all Governments requiring the pledge, to do nothing of the kind, as well as to grant any *bonâ fide* trader the same privileges and rights which are enjoyed by the occupants of its stations and free territory. The work is one of philanthropy, and those who have hitherto supplied and continue to supply funds for its performance are thoroughly conscious that they are not creating for themselves any sources of income. They trust that civilization and commerce will follow their footsteps; and should such indeed be the result, they will consider themselves amply repaid for any sacrifice they may have made. I will not now take up your space by referring to other accusations, except the statement that ""duels were not infrequent"" among the *employés* at the Congo. I am not aware of one. There are, however, two or three trifling points in your notice of my mission to which I would ask permission to allude, to prevent misconception.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Tribute to the African-Aid Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'WE have been often rather tauntingly asked what the African-Aid Society is really effecting.

Why are we urging this upon the Government—upon governors, and upon subjects? Because with an increase of the useful power of civilised government in the interior, those roads will also act as a curb to the aggressive instincts of Ashantee—as stimulants to increased production, because affording facilities for increased commerce—as placing the engines of civilization in immediate contact with the hitherto unmitigated barbarous superstitions of Ashantee; and rendering it possible for the missionary society labouring in the protectorate to advance and maintain its outposts, in an efficient state at a considerable distance from the Coast without a ruinous expense, and without that dangerous and weakening isolation which has hitherto almost neutralised the zeal and devotion of its indefatigable agents.\n\nIn such a country as Africa, and among such people as the Africans, the power of Christian civilization must be exhibited wherever there are efforts for inculcating Christianity, if these latter are to have any corresponding success. The creation and maintenance of good roads, where such facilities for intercommunication have hitherto been unknown, would be a great and useful exhibition of the power of Christian civilization. They could not fail surely and more or less rapidly to ameliorate the social condition of a people which, amid tropical luxuriance, suffers most frightful privations.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa.

Is it surprising that we should have echoed the complaint and the appeal of the Archbishop of York—that we, who feel ourselves highly honoured and greatly privileged by God in being permitted to give a portion of our most earnest energies to this ""pioneer"" work for Him, and for those whom He has made of one blood with us (though so differing in colour and other accidents), should lament the apathy which hinders us, and remind our fellow-subjects of that great duty which especially devolves upon them and upon us, as the descendants of those who for so many years perpetrated and permitted the African slave-trade,\nPage 65', 'last_edit_date': '1864-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Africa, anything beyond the mere egotism of surface philanthropy, it will find fresh support.

Error is glittering; nothing is easier than to dazzle and win with it. Truth is the reverse of this; and struggles amid difficulty and hardship into appreciation and favour.

During some years its income fluctuated from three or four hundred to a thousand pounds a-year. People who could not, or did not, care to see, or were unable to grasp the great principle of its existence, sneered at it, no doubt. It was doing nothing, of course. No one could perceive any rich fruit of its exertions; and yet it had sown and gathered something in from the first seed—and yet it was from the first moment gradually advancing toward the great harvest of its present utility—and yet it had securely laid the foundation of its present goodly edifice. The germ of its actual vigorous life was swelling amid the cerements of the national apathy, anon to throw out its roots, to raise high its head and spread wide its branches; to fatten and flourish in the rich soil and sunshine of popular wealth and favour, and cast around the precious leaves of Christian truth appointed for the healing of the nations.\n\nIt would justly be thought presumptuous in us to liken the African-Aid Society, now struggling through the diseases and feebleness of infancy, with that veteran society whose efforts have been crowned with much success.

The swarthy races in Africa have not done their part in this great work to which the Creator appointed mankind. It has yet to be accomplished, and the time seems now to be at hand for it to commence.

Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education. (Not only were some of the 'white church' evangelists black, but some white mission› aries were placed in Afro-American schools to prepare for African service.) But black church organizations of their own volition and in their own right soon became the bellwether in, arguably, the most effective missionary enterprises in Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'It was in West Africa that a relatively large number of members of an educated elite had emerged by 1880 and the country that produced the first significant number was Sierra Leone.

Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

The letter triggered the interest of leaders of the Ethiopianist movement in securing more information about AME; they requested and received copies of the AME Church discipline, hymn books, and liturgy. However, particular interest was shown in possibilities of higher education for Africans in the United States. This fortuitous train of events led to the dispatch of an Ethiopianist delegation, headed by Reverend James Mata Dwane, to the United States in 1896, and culminated in the formal absorption of the 'Ethiopian' Church by the AME and the formal entry of the AME Church into the foreign missionary field.\nSpecifically, Dwane pressed Afro-Americans to come to South Africa and to push the educational mission of the AME Church, arguing that South Africa offered 'educated and consecrated American Negroes their greatest field of usefulness'.$^{30}$ For the time being, however, it would be necessary for the mother Church to help out by training African youth in American educational institutions.

For example, in 1930, in a fit of exuberance, an AME bishop purchased a farm of several thousand acres of land in South Africa with the intention of settling members of the Church on it in an AME colony.

Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Increasing British and French interests in India and the Indian Ocean - in Aden, Mauritius, Madagascar and the new sultanate of Zan› zibar - were soon to have their repercussions on East Africa. It needs to be emphasized, however, that the Euro/American presence was waterborne and coast-centred. It made no appreciable penetration into the interior of the continent before 1850, whereas the major events in Africa in the early nineteenth century - the Ethiopian revival, the Mfecane, the West African djihads - were initiated from the interior of the continent, although Muhammad 'Alfs reforms in Egypt were a notable exception.\nThe missionary factor made a substantial contribution to the spectacular British success in Freetown. Responding to the challenge of the new opportunities, German missionaries, mostly from the Basel Mission but with a few from the Bremen Mission, overcame their pietist hesitation and became involved in the politics of development in a British colony. They and their British colleagues found more opportunities as farm managers, linguists, teachers, builders, and promoters of commercial enterprises than as preachers. A number of mission stations were established, and leading individual missionaries became deeply involved in local political and racial conflicts; nevertheless, nothing like the Freetown success was achieved. Elsewhere, missionary organizations were being founded, and a few pioneer mission stations established in which preliminary educational efforts and linguistic studies were being undertaken that would yield fruit later. However, as a significant factor of change in Africa, Christian missions belonged to the second rather than the first half of the nineteenth century.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'Back-to-Africa movements', 'content': ""While in Liberia, Bishop Turner advised what he called American 'black capitalists' that 'if they would start trading with Liberia they would be worth millions in a few years'. Few responded, although a group did organize the African Development Society in 1899, the chief objective of which was to encourage Afro-Americans to buy land and settle in East Central Africa. The Society would sell shares or land rights offered by African petitioners but only to Afro-American or African purchasers. 4 Bishop Turner also later served as an adviser to the International Migration Society (IMS) of Alabama, which sent about 500 emigrants to Africa before it became defunct in 1900. Some of the 500 remained in Liberia; others returned to the United States. Those who remained fared reasonably well; evidently more than a few of them prospered. On the other hand, those who returned told horror stories of poor land, inadequate food and poor living conditions. These stories reduced the likelihood of any large-scale Afro-American emigration movement, even though prospects for blacks in the United States were declining from 1895 to 1900. Nevertheless, numerous Afro-Americans evidently continued to give serious consider› ation to African emigration, just as others in the United States and the Caribbean simply moved away from overt discriminatory practices into other regions near by.\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, the back-to-Africa baton was picked up by others. For example, one Captain Dean, early in the twentieth century, hoped to engineer the settlement of American blacks in South Africa to fashion a powerful black state there. After the briefest sojourn meant to arrange for this settlement, however, white authorities expelled Dean from the Cape for what were termed 'provocative activities'. And in 1914, Chief Alfred C. Sam, a Gold Coast African, turned up in Oklahoma, persuaded about sixty black farmers that Africa offered them greater oppor› tunities and sailed with them to Saltpond in the Gold Coast. Finding Chief Sam's claims to be exaggerated and encountering restrictions from the Gold Coast officials which inhibited the entry of American immigrants, most of the Oklahomans eventually returned to the United States.

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students.

By far the greatest portion of the traffic on the routes was for local and regional exchange.

The scheme is one for the establishment of an institute for the training of negro girls to be run on lines similar to those followed in the working of the Congo Institute at Colwyn Bay, where young men are educated, trained up in Gospel truths on unsectarian lines, and taught a trade, whereby they can earn their own living by craftsmanship, and impart in their native tongue the knowledge they possess to their benighted fellow countrymen instructing them not only in ethics, but useful trades. Mr. Hughes, the principal, wishes to extend the benefactions to girls, and for this purpose makes an appeal for funds, which it is hoped will be responded to in a manner worthy the cause, not only for the sake of the spiritual leaven, but in the interests of commerce, which such an effort induces and stimulates.\n\nThe scheme of education as carried out at the Colwyn Bay Institute has been found to work most satisfactorily. Among its chief advantages may be pointed out: (1) The boys are taken away from old and injurious surroundings, from old practices, superstitions, temptations, and evil influences; (2) They for four or five years are residents in a Christian country and under new and beneficial influence, and see the benefits of civilisation; (3) They acquire without difficulty the English language, and, indeed, are able to read and study English books and translate them into their native language; (4) The youths are educated to become thorough masters of some handicraft.\n\nIt should perhaps be mentioned that carpentering, printing, tailoring, &c., are taught them free, for the Welsh people have never charged a single apprenticeship fee; and Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., the great African shippers, convey the students to and from Africa free.\n\nMost successfully has the scheme worked; the boys who have returned to Africa have all done well.

Mr. Morris was recommended to Samuel Gurney, Esq. by Mr. Welsh, the United States Minister in London, in terms which we feel compelled to quote: ""Mr. Morris has thrown an enthusiastic energy into the work he has entered upon, which gives the strongest promise of success. His earnest desire is for the Christian education of the sons of the savage chiefs who border on Liberia. They are to be the future rulers of Africa. This is to be his life-work; and his instruments will be schools for the purpose established in Liberia. In such a cause he cannot fail to have the support of many good people."" Mr. Morris has secured an estate of 800 acres in Liberia, where he is about to erect his college, in which he proposes to educate the sons of native kings and chiefs. His admirable plan is to make them at the same time educated men, Christians, and practical coffee planters and general agriculturists. This is surely a work fraught with well-grounded hopes of at present incalculable good to Africa; and as such, Mr. Morris, who seems to us to be peculiarly fitted for it, has our warmest desires and earnest prayers for a full measure of success. Mr. T. A. Denny, of London, has promised 100l. of the 1,000l. required by Mr. Morris, who, in his letter to Joseph Gurney Barclay, Esq., and George Williams, Esq.,—well-known in London business circles—who have accepted the office of Treasurers for the funds which Mr. Morris hopes to collect while in England, says: ""When the school-house shall have been built, the teacher engaged and at his post of duty, and the boys in their seats, THEN will I commence to draw on the funds deposited, and placed in your hands as Treasurers.""', 'last_edit_date': '1879-04-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1879#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Appeal of a Native African Clergyman on behalf of his Fellow-Countrymen.\n\nThe Rev. George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C. Billing, who has for so many years been interested in the Native African Church and its missionary activities, has carefully considered these proposals with Mr. Nicol.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mission Work in Africa, Africans Helping Themselves', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Rev.

Our roof and ceiling were finished and the galleries entered upon, when I found that funds were getting low. I issued handbills on Saturday evening, calling a special meeting for Monday night, not stating for what it was called. Nobody knew about it, and curiosity was excited. The large schoolroom was filled with people, and after opening the meeting I at once told them if they wanted me to go on with the work, I must have more money. I should say that we had already collected over 200l. The people were anxious that the work should go on, of which they there and then gave practical proof. One man got up and said he would give two guineas; another, who had given me seven guineas before, gave 20l; another, who before, had given 6l. 6s., gave twenty-three guineas. This sent some of the people almost off their heads; but when the uproar had ceased promises came thick and fast. Six, five, four, three guineas, and sums ranging from sixpence, soon brought up a grand total promised (and some paid) in that meeting of over 120l. Our people have given altogether about 420l., which for us is very good, we think.\n\nThe Rev. W. J. Elliott writes from Lagos High School: ""At the close of our half-year\'s work in June all the schools were care-\n\nfully examined, the elementary day school by the native ministers, assisted by the head master, and the high school, male and female, myself.

As Ministers, we have just been relieved of a little of the burden which has from the beginning lain upon our shoulders, the Circuit having undertaken the entire responsibility of maintaining the elementary schools, and appointed a school board, or committee, to manage them, of course under our constant supervision as heretofore; but we have no anxiety as to the \'ways and means.\' The attendance is increasing, and we expect a great influx, as the people begin to feel that the schools are their own, and that by supporting them they are helping themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION OF FEMALES IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Church Missionary Record*, giving account of the erection of an edifice, at the cost of 2,500l., for a female boarding-school at Sierra Leone, the money being an anonymous gift of a gentleman in England for that especial purpose, says truly: ""The educational process is going on amongst the men; that of females must keep pace with it, else disastrous consequences must ensue.

It has been a cause of great satisfaction to us to receive the above donations from M'Carthy's Island; and these, too, spontaneously collected by Dr. Horton before our remarks of last month had reached the Gambia. It is an encouraging fact that, with one or two exceptions, such as the Commandant, &c., all the contributors are Africans. We cannot too strongly urge upon the Africans in every part of West Africa to which this journal penetrates, that all our efforts are directed to procuring for them increased facilities and protection—for advancing their interests and the Christian civilization of their native countries. Doctor Horton suggests in his letter that the Africans on the Coast ought to contribute the 200l. a-year which the Society requires in order to give it sufficient freedom of action. If all the native traders down the Coast would make it a personal affair; if every one would for himself determine to be an annual subscriber of, say, only one guinea to the Society, and to send this subscription forward regularly, we should indeed feel stimulated anew, and powerfully stimulated, to increased exertions for them. It will be a proud day for us when we can say to the English friends of Africa, as well as to the revilers of Africa, that the African-Aid Society has an African list of subscribers, whose annual contributions render it independent of lukewarm European sympathies. Such a position would greatly strengthen our hands, both with the British Government and the British public. It will do much for us to be able to show them an educated Africa, keenly alive to its responsibilities towards those from among whom they have been brought out by the education they have received—fully alive to the necessity of those ameliorations of Government system, and those increased facilities for the development of African resources, for which we, in their interest, have ever been contending. We write freely, because we do not want one penny of their money for ourselves—but only for those disbursements necessarily attendant on public action. All we do for them is done gratuitously, in the hope of advancing God's cause in the world—and all we ask from them in return is to evince their sense of the importance and utility of our services—of those services which have really now given to West Africa a voice and a representation in Europe—by relieving us from the painful necessity of having to ask from others the small amount necessary to cover the unavoidable expenses incurred in thus serving them.

It may be regarded as having been formally instituted at a second meeting at Cambridge, on the 1st of November, 1859. The first head of the Mission was Bishop Mackenzie, who established a station at Magomero, on the River Shiri, where a large settlement of slaves, liberated by the Mission party, was formed under the guidance of Dr. Livingstone. The appeal proceeds with a summary of the work that is being done by the Mission at the present time. 1. On the site of the old slave market at Zanzibar, purchased by the liberality of the Rev. A. N. West, of Pembroke College, who died whilst in sole charge of the Mission, Christmas-day, 1874, a fine church which is far advanced towards completion. Adjoining it the Bishop hopes soon to erect houses for the clergy and mission workers, schools, and a hospital. 2. At Mbweni, four miles from Zanzibar, a settlement of adult liberated slaves has been formed, and attached to this station is a girls’ school. 3. At Kiungani, two miles from Zanzibar, is a large boys’ industrial school, which is partly self-supporting. Much of the carpenter’s and other work for the fabric of the Zanzibar church has been done here. 4. A house in Zanzibar was opened as a hospital on Dec. 12, 1875, upon the arrival of Miss Allen and two nurses. It has already done excellent service. 5. Magila, the Mission station on the mainland, is in charge of the Rev. J. P. Farler and Mr. Moss, and has lately been reinforced by Mr. Clarke; the reports are favourable. Bishop Steere has just returned to Zanzibar after five months’ absence on an expedition to the Nyassa country. The details of this interesting journey, begun from Linoi (a point some distance south of Zanzibar, and the nearest part of the coast to Lake Nyassa), at the end of last October, and completed Jan. 21, 1876, will be found in a pamphlet printed at Zanzibar, and now issued under the title of “A Walk to the Nyassa Country.” This suggests the feasibility of extending the operations of the Mission over 300 miles or upwards on the mainland in the direction of the country first occupied under Bishop Mackenzie towards Lake Nyassa. It also affords convincing evidence of the existence still of the slave-trade in the number of caravans which were met. It reveals likewise, incidentally, the self-devotion and perseverance of the Bishop, who when the European members of his party failed him through ill health, started on the journey with native bearers only. The Bishop estimates that by this means some 10,000 slaves were conveyed to the coast. By God’s providence the journey was, notwithstanding difficulties and privations, accomplished safely. In a letter recently addressed by Bishop Steere to the members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, he says: “I have just returned from a walk of some 700 miles, through almost unknown country, undertaken in your name and for your honour. I have agreed with the greatest of the native chiefs (Mataka) near the Lake Nyassa for a site and for countenance in our mission. I find that my appeal for personal help is being nobly responded to. We paid during the year 20 outward passages. I hear of four more, perhaps now on their way, and of others pressing to follow them. . . . There remain 14 of us, mostly young students, out of whom I feel no doubt the most efficient missionaries will ultimately be formed. Not one of my helpers is desiring money profit from his work.

The African-Aid Society acts, therefore, as the pioneer of Christian missions, in its endeavours to remove those exceptional obstacles, which not only add very much to the expense of those missions, and to the privations and dangers of the devoted missionaries, but limit also the extension of those missions, and retard their great work of the proclamation of the glad tidings of salvation, the acceptance of which can alone remove the bleeding woes of Africa. We feel that the African-Aid Society cannot have a more glorious title than that of ""THE PIONEER OF CHRISTIAN MISSIONS AND OF CIVILISING COMMERCE."" It is in this capacity of pioneer that the efforts of the society have been so much directed toward the Gambia and the Sherboro countries, and toward our Gold Coast possessions, Dahomey, and the districts in which the great river Niger presents a path for missionary and commercial action. It is as a ""pioneer"" that it waits, and watches, and acts (so far as circumstances will permit) for the removal or modification of those deep curses to Eastern Africa, the Portuguese rule from Delagoa Bay to the territories of Zanzibar, and the connivance of the Sultan of the latter, for pecuniary considerations, at that devastating slave-trade carried on by the Arabs with the Persian Gulf. What a field of arduous labour is here presented to the Christian view—is here placed before the philanthropist, the statesman, and the merchant. And are we not justified in saying that it is a disgrace to a Christian and enlightened country and people—a country and a people whom God has specially entrusted with the work of the spread of the Gospel of Christ and of true civilization among the nations—that such a work should languish for want of a very moderate degree of encouragement and support?

One of England\'s greatest philanthropists said that, ""If Africa is to be evangelised she must be evangelised by her sons."" Of course, not exclusive of the aid of England\'s sons, but a black ministry with one or two whites at its head will be found more effectual than otherwise. The following fact will be seen to give much force to this suggestion. White missionaries are obliged very frequently to go to Europe to recruit their health, no doubt at a heavy cost to the Society, to say nothing of the disadvantage that their stations must suffer owing to their absence, which sometimes is rather protracted. The two oldest missionaries in the mission now, excepting the superintendent, are blacks. One has been out twenty-five years, and the other twelve years, yet they have not once had occasion to go to Jamaica to recruit their health; whereas the whites, without exception, have found it necessary to go to England, some at rather short intervals. Should the question be asked, ""Why are not some youths taken out of the day-schools at Cameroons and Victoria, and sent to England, or even to the Sierra Leone Grammar School, to be trained up as teachers and native preachers?"" or ""Why cannot a boarding school be established at Victoria?"" the answer, no doubt, will be, ""Oh, it will cost the Society a very large amount of money."" Undoubtedly true; but isn\'t it a generally acknowledged fact, and don\'t we ourselves know it from experience, that it is always best, in the long run, to purchase things at wholesale prices? A wholesale purchase may entail on the purchaser a heavy expense at once, but in the end it will be found far cheaper than purchasing at retail prices. Victoria is a cheap place—food and fish so very plentiful that the missionaries up here send all the way down there very often to buy food, which requires only tobacco and salt to buy it with, and which can be had every day. Victoria being a market town, a boarding school once established there, with competent teachers and a constant supply of books and other requisites to be sold to the pupils of the school, will, in the course of a few years, supply the different stations in the mission with young men capable of taking schools and churches under their own care, and in this way the work of evangelisation will be more surely and steadily carried on, and the Society\'s labours and expenses be more than amply rewarded; also, in course of time, the school will become a self-supporting school.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-07-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1869#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ACTION OF THE AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Africa, anything beyond the mere egotism of surface philanthropy, it will find fresh support.

Every year the missionary schools discharge a number of educated men and women who almost invariably embark in trade. Most of them have some small capital, which they use to trade with the interior natives, and the produce they thus obtain they either ship on consignment to England, to obtain the proceeds in British and other goods and silver coin, or sell it to the large British and foreign mercantile houses on the Coast, receiving goods from them in exchange for a renewal of operations with the producers in the interior. These native traders almost universally prefer to remit their produce to Europe for sale; but in this they labour under the great disadvantage of having their capital locked up until they obtain from Europe the proceeds of the sales, in goods or money. They estimate their loss through such delays at something like 25 per cent., and there can be no doubt that the facilities a bank might safely afford would be productive of great gain, both to the traders and the bank; while, if the limits of our article would permit, we could point out how the European mercantile establishments may also be largely benefited thereby. To every one acquainted with the business of the West Coast, and the mode in which it is conducted, it is patent that the establishment of a well-conducted bank, with adequate capital, will lead to a greatly increased production on the West Coast—in a few years, it may be, to 100 per cent. increase. A bank, moreover, that is capable of offering ample guarantees for the safety of moneys deposited with it, cannot fail of being highly useful to the public service as bankers to the several Administrations, receiving from the Colonial Treasurers the proceeds of the Customs' duties and other sources of revenue, and holding them at the disposal of the Government in the shape most convenient to the latter. Such a bank will link West Africa, now isolated, with the great financial system of the civilized world, giving her a recognized position therein—a fact of enormous importance for the British West African Settlements, when we consider that almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economizing labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will show European capital the way to further profitable investment in those too long neglected countries. We have always steadfastly maintained that ere many years the West Africa Settlements will take rank among the most valuable colonial possessions of Great Britain, and every fresh step towards the realization of this prediction is to us a source of real delight. The bank is such a step, and we shall welcome it with all our heart. We can assure it, too, a welcome all along the West Coast, to which it cannot fail to prove a benefactor. Our only regret at this moment is, that it will not be brought before the public in time for us to advertise it more fully in this number of our journal.

1622,"Religious establishments in Africa, supported by both local communities and colonial authorities, played a significant role in education and charity through collaborative efforts and government grants.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that religious establishments in Africa, backed by local communities and colonial authorities, played a significant role in education and charity through collaborative efforts and government grants. The textbook highlights the role of Christian missions in establishing schools and promoting education as a means of evangelization, with colonial governments providing grants-in-aid, particularly in Southern Africa where missionary activities led to the creation of elementary, secondary, and teacher-training institutions. Local African initiatives, such as those by Gikuyu cultural nationalists and local rulers in Uganda and Southern Nigeria, also contributed to educational expansion. The involvement of black missionaries and Afro-Brazilian communities further illustrates the collaborative nature of these efforts. However, the textbook notes that educational services during colonial times were often inadequate and unevenly distributed, primarily benefiting white settlers and administrators, indicating a disparity between the claim and historical reality. Similarly, The African Times articles mention that Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions received government allowances for education and charity, with religious societies like the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society establishing schools in West Africa. These societies collaborated with local communities, as seen in the efforts of Bishop Crowther in Bonny and Rev. George Nicol in the Gambia, who raised local funds for school chapels and mission houses. The articles also emphasize the need for greater government support, criticizing its inadequacy and suggesting that reliance on missionary efforts was insufficient.

It would appear that the educational activities of the missionaries had been far more successful than their evangelical activities by 1870.$^{18}$ Not only had many elementary or village schools been established but, from as early as the 1840s, teacher-training and secondary institutions were founded. The Glasgow Missionary Society, for instance, established a seminary at Lovedale in Natal in July 1841 to which an industrial department was attached. This taught masonry, carpentry, waggon-making and smithing, and from 1861 on, printing and book-binding.$^{19}$ The Roman Catholics had also established a convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family with a boarding school, primary school and home of refuge in Natal and another one in the Orange Free State by 1877. In 1868, the French missionaries established a teacher training institute at Amanzimtote and a seminary for girls at Inanda in Natal in the mid-i86os, and in 1880 the Anglicans established the St Albans College among the Zulu. 20 Probably even more far-reaching than that of the Islamic revolution was the impact of this Christian religious revolution on African societies. This was most obvious in the manner of life of the converted Africans. Apart from acquiring various technical skills, the Africans gained access to Euro› pean medical ideas, however rudimentary, while the traditional styles of architecture were improved upon and the wearing of Western-type clothing became more common.$^{21}$ Also, by condemning polygamy, belief in ances› tors, traditional gods and witchcraft, the missionaries weakened the tra› ditional basis of African societies as well as family relationships.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.766, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The spread of Christianity, Islam and western education was another important impact of colonialism. There is no doubt that taking advantage of the peace and order as well as the patronage and in some areas the positive encouragement provided by colonialism, Christian missionaries and Muslim clerics pushed their activities further and further inland. As K. Asare Opoku has shown (Chapter 20), Christianity and Islam gained far more ground during the colonial period than had been the case during the previous three or four centuries put together. It was during this period that Christianity gained a firm foothold in East and Central Africa at times following or at times being followed by the flag and trade. Islam also spread rapidly in West and East Africa as a result of the general improvement of communications during the colonial period and the patronage of both the French and the British rulers. It should be emphasized, as Opoku has done, that these gains were not made at the expense of traditional religion. What colonialism did, then, was to strengthen and perpetuate religious pluralism in Africa and thereby enrich her religious life.\nClosely associated with the spread of Christianity was that of western education. As has been shown in many of the chapters above, the Christian missions were mainly responsible for this. It should, however, be borne in mind that they could operate mainly because of the grants they received from the colonial administrations. Certainly, by the end of the colonial regime, there were relatively few areas without at least elementary schools. The spread of western education had far-reaching social effects among which was an increase in the number of the westernized educated African elite, an elite which now constitutes the ruling oligarchy and the backbone of the civil service of African states.\nAnother important colonial impact, a mixed blessing as will be shown later, was of course the provision of a lingua franca for each colony or set of colonies. In all the colonies, the mother tongue of the colonial power, either in its pure or pidgin form, became the official and business language and in many cases the main means of communication between the numerous linguistic groups that constitute the population of each colony.

The importance of schools for the missionary enterprise was expressed by Elias Shrenk as follows: If we had a nation with formal education, able to read and write, my plans for mission work would be different. But now I am convinced that the opening of schools is our main task. I have a low opinion of Christians who are not able to read their Bible. The smallest schoolchild is a missionary and establishes a relationship with the grown-ups, which would not exist without a school. 30 The missionaries played quite an important role in the introduction of a money economy in Africa. Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures.

For example, the Presbyterian Church sponsored black missionaries in French Cameroon as early as 1896. And the Reverend William H. Sheppard, a black graduate of Hampton Institute, Virginia, prodded the Southern Presbyterian Church into undertaking missionary work in the Congo in the 1890s, where he represented the Church and quickly found that his mission was attracting converts by 'the hundreds' and expanding 'until it was one of the most important stations of Christianity'.$^{26}$ Meanwhile, at the turn of the twentieth century, the Seventh-Day Adventists dispatched three black missionaries to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and as a result of a five-year tour sent three young African adherents, including Daniel Sharpe Malekebu, to the American black schools for education.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

There is no doubt that many Africans readily accepted the new faith and that Christianity gained far more ground in Africa during the period under review than it had done in the previous two or three centuries. The first group of Africans to embrace Christianity would appear to be those who were regarded by the Africans as social outcasts, and the downtrodden such as lepers and others who suffered various forms of social disabilities in traditional African societies. Included in this category were those who had broken certain traditional taboos and were fleeing from persecution, and mothers who gave birth to twins in societies where there was a taboo against twin births. Such mothers found refuge for themselves and their children in mission stations. The social outcasts had nothing to lose by embracing Christianity: on the contrary, they gained hope, confidence and inspiration from the missionary teaching of equality and brotherhood, and also 'from the idea that one must not fatalistically accept his or her station in life as beyond human control'. 31 The spread of Christianity during colonial times was not due exclusively to missionary initiative. African converts, catechists and ministers zealously spread Christianity, while some of the traditional rulers such as Lewanika and Lobengula, as we have seen already, gave every assistance to mission› aries. The expansion of Christianity in Africa was largely due to the zeal of African converts, especially in the period after 1914. There were innumerable instances of African evangelists going outside their own ethnic groups to work as missionaries. For example, evangelists from Buganda took Christianity to other peoples like the Banyakare, Bakiga, Batoro, Bagisu and Langi, and Baganda evangelists went as far as Ruanda and the Belgian Congo (see Fig. 7.1). Famous among them was Canon Apolo Kivebulaya (1866-1933), who worked among the Pygmies as a missionary in the Belgian Congo (1896-9 and again 1915-33).$^{32}$ In West Africa, the Yoruba bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, worked in the Niger valley.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi.

'It [Islam] placed more emphasis than Christianity on cohesion and less on competition and individual achievement.'$^{28}$ A further asset in favour of Islam was that with all the disruptions which colonial rule had brought in its wake, there was the need for a new basis for social integration, and Islam provided this basis since it possesses significant resources for those who had lost their traditional roots."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash.

The church was densely crowded with people to hear him. He said that success does not at all times favour a missionary, although every true Christian desires that it should do so. He instanced the Apostles, how they were sometimes persecuted, and at other times were able to rejoice exceedingly at the success which attended their ministry. Missionary experience must necessarily be the same now. He had previously told us in a similar meeting, about a year ago, that the King of Bonny desired him to establish mission stations and schools in that place, for the education of their children. He then told the King he was very glad to learn of his good intentions, but that a missionary station, and the erection of schools, would at the least cost him 300l.; if the King could pay half he would willingly establish a station. The King, to show his earnestness, said that he and his chiefs would do so. The Bishop, therefore, took with him carpenters, and other working men, to commence building, and they have finished a comfortable church and station for Divine worship and a missionary\'s residence. The natives were not backward in sending their children to school, and some of the aged, too, came to know something of the Bible. Each parent promised to pay 2l. per annum for each child\'s education. He held lately an annual examination after a very short notice, at which some of the captains and supercargoes of vessels then laying in Bonny River were present. He read the programme of lessons on which they were examined—and to the astonishment of the audience the Bishop said that their lessons were repeated by heart, without the least mistake, following and pronouncing their proper stops and words so distinctly that the different parents who were there assembled, with the captains and supercargoes, were so perfectly satisfied that they paid down, in hard silver and gold money, 2l. for each child, some having nine, some ten, &c., making a total sum of above 100l. He further added that he had promised to take to Bonny a horse to show them, which they had reminded him not to forget, as none of them ever knew what a horse was, excepting the King."" He bought a horse and took it down, and no sooner was the horse landed than the whole town was in confusion; everyone wanted to see a horse; some persons who came in contact with the animal threw themselves in the bush—(of course this set the audience in a great fit of laughter)—and there were gathered together not less than 500 persons, men, women, and children, asking various questions, as to what sort of food the horse can live upon. He said that, to satisfy their curiosity, he ordered his son to ride on the noble creature saddled, and go about the town, that everyone might be satisfied. He then again called their attention to the construction of roads in their town. He said to them: ""You wanted a church, and station, and school—I have builded them. You wanted to see a horse—I have shown you one. But if you want horses to live here they must have exercise, and how can this be got without making roads in the town."" He consulted with the King, who had a meeting with his chiefs, and, to his great surprise, at midnight the King came to him, and told him that he was just from the meeting of his chiefs, who agreed that the Bishop should open roads and streets; and accordingly he lost no time in asking for the great Fetish bush, which they granted to him, and through which, after some little trouble, he cut a way. The meeting was not a little shocked when the Bishop said that a great way in this bush was a Fetish house, in which were the skulls of human beings whose flesh had been eaten, the people being cannibals. The Bishop deeply deplored the superstitious notions of this people, in destroying the lives of those women who may have been delivered of twins—with the infants. He had used strenuous efforts to save one, but they refused, as it was the custom of their country. He, however, seized an opportunity of having an open-air preaching, which was attended by many of the people, to whom he preached from the words (in Genesis xxv. 23)—""Two nations are in thy womb;"" and he said that they paid every attention to his sermon, which he hopes may take effect in their hearts, and be the means of putting an end to those diabolical practices in which they have so long indulged.'}, {'id': 4804, 'article_title': 'THE CONGO TREATY', 'full_section_title': 'THE CONGO TREATY', 'last_edit_date': '02-26-1884', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1884#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_03_1884', 'content': 'VII.

They are both Protestant Churches; both hold and teach the essential truths of the Gospel, and love to see the Bible in the hands of every member of their communion, and, indeed, of every human being, as containing all that is necessary to human salvation without dependence on priesthood or human inventions. The work of evangelisation has been carried on by both of them in the colony with equal zeal and success, and both ought to receive aid from the revenues of the colony, if that aid can be given in a form which does not create dependence. And we are sure that it may and ought to be thus given. The civil authorities have done next to nothing as regards the education of the people, which has hitherto been the work of the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies and the Native Pastorate. Let this work continue in their hands. If education and religion be dissociate in Sierra Leone, a people will be raised up whose excesses would be ruinous. The education given to the rising generation must be combined with religious teaching; and we cannot conceive any way in which the sum of, say, one or two thousand pounds a year could be applied with so great present and future advantage, as in distributing it, whether in the form of capitation grant or in some other equal and impartial way, among the Church and Wesleyan schools. The time has come when the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies ought to be relieved from some part of the burden they have hitherto cheerfully borne in the hope of raising up a people in Sierra Leone to love and serve God. The time has come when the State, the local Executive, ought to take upon itself boldly the chief part, if not the whole, of the expense hitherto borne by those societies in educating the children of the colony; and we hope to see it perform this duty, which we are certain that it would do if the Legislative Council were such a representation of the people as it ought to be.

One man got up and said he would give two guineas; another, who had given me seven guineas before, gave 20l; another, who before, had given 6l. 6s., gave twenty-three guineas. This sent some of the people almost off their heads; but when the uproar had ceased promises came thick and fast.

George Nicol, Colonial Chaplain of the British Settlements of the River Gambia, who is at present on a visit to this country, desires to draw attention to the following statement: His special work is to minister to the officers of the Colonial Government, the European merchants, and the large and increasing body of Christian traders who are constantly coming into the settlement from Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast. To these he ministers, and superintends an organization similar to that found in any well-worked parish in England. The congregation is occasionally increased by the visit of one of Her Majesty’s ships. He has also the spiritual charge of the convicts in the gaol and the inmates of the Colonial Hospital. In connection with the Colonial Church at Bathurst there is now a congregation of 200 Christian worshippers and about eighty communicants. The church can only accommodate 250. In addition to the work connected with his chaplaincy, Mr. Nicol recognizes the claims of the heathen upon the Christian Church, and has started three missions for those in and around the town of Bathurst; but as yet has been unable to reach the neighbouring tribes—namely, the Jolas, the Sérérés, the Polos, and the Mandingoes. For upwards of 600 miles higher up the River Gambia, on either bank of that noble river, one mercantile firm alone has seventy trading factories. There is not one resident missionary preaching the Gospel to the people trading with these merchants. Merchant clerks and other traders go up and down the country for the purpose of trade, but there is not one Christian teacher, European or native, who has taken up his residence among the people to learn their language and to instruct them. It is this sad state of things Mr. Nicol is anxious to remedy. He has formed at the Gambia a Native Church Missionary Association, and by the aid of his congregation and the merchants on the spot, has raised 50l. and built a small school chapel on the outskirts of Bathurst which is open daily for service and evangelistic meetings, and where a lay-helper is rendering efficient service. He has also been invited to build another chapel at Albreda, eighty miles up the river.\n\nThe present appeal is for funds to build School Chapels and Mission Houses at several of the most important trading stations. To do this satisfactorily, 1,000l. must be raised; and to maintain the necessary mission agents and teachers, at least 500l. per annum is required.\n\nIt may be added that the Church Missionary Society would rejoice to see this work advanced, though unable themselves to undertake the responsibility of any fresh expenditure in this part of the world; and that the Rev. R. C. Billing, who has for so many years been interested in the Native African Church and its missionary activities, has carefully considered these proposals with Mr. Nicol.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I thank you much for your able and well-timed article in your issue of August last on the subject of the Education of the Gold Coast Protectorate, and the responsibility of the British Government in connection with it. Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Too much praise cannot be given you for your unwearied and long-continued efforts on behalf of poor Africa and her unfortunate sons.

It is greatly to be hoped that such an earnest appeal will not be suffered to pass by unheard. It is gratifying to state that the Accra Church of England High-class School has been fairly established and set in proper working order, and since its establishment the number of its pupils has been steadily on the increase. If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

Although not the first among European nations to plant colonies beyond Europe, England had acquired a more extensive dominion of colonies and dependencies than any other nation in the world. She undertook the colonisation of West Africa, not by any means for renown or direct commercial advantage, but entirely with the magnanimous and philanthropic object of the salvation of the sons of Africa, both temporally and spiritually. The Colonies on the West Coast of Africa were annexed to Great Britain, first, for the suppression of that abominable traffic, the slave trade, and, secondly, for the free propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The colonial dependencies of Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, which formed a portion of the 7,500,000 square miles of the British Empire, included Sierra Leone or the West Africa Settlements, the River Gambia, the Gold Coast Colony and the Slave Coast—now Lagos Colony—a total area of some 40,000 square miles. The lecturer briefly described the geographical position and features of each settlement, and then gave an interesting account of the circumstances under which Sierra Leone, the oldest colony in West Africa, became a British settlement, an episode with which those who have studied history are generally familiar. This colony eventually became peopled, and a foundation was laid for the labours of the Church Missionary Society and other Christian bodies in the year 1791. In the year 1799 a few Englishmen established in London ""The Society for Mission to Africa and the East,"" up to which time the Church of England had done nothing to spread Christianity among the heathen. In 1812 this name was changed to ""The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East."" The first missionaries were sent to West Africa, because it had ever been, and it was then, the chief theatre of the inhuman slave trade. The great difficulty was to get missionaries, owing to the fatality of the climate to Europeans, the trying difficulties and experiences of the work, and the prevalent but erroneous idea that all efforts to raise the blacks in the social scale must prove fruitless. Ultimately two German missionaries were prevailed upon to enter upon the great and good work, and others subsequently followed from England, and ever since had been from time to time reinforced. In the first month of 1814 the foundation stone of the first Christian Church in Africa was laid at Bassia, and the committee of the above-mentioned society, now co-operating with the British & Foreign Society, were deeply engaged in carrying out the plan of redeeming as many African children as possible from slavery and attaching them to the missionary settlements. Having gone through the early history of the Church on the West Coast of Africa, the lecturer proceeded to detail a few facts to prove the glorious results of the labours of the religious societies in co-operation with the foundation laid by the goodwill and philanthropic energies of many noble-hearted men, whose efforts and constant ambition were devoted to the abolition of slavery and the slave trade. Amongst many results were the most perfect freedom of the meanest subject; the existence, all over the coast line, of peace and tranquillity as set against the unending civil wars and riots that marked the period of slavery; the ecclesiastical establishment of the West African settlements, and the profuse circulation of the Bible throughout the Colonies.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is quite impossible for us to dismiss the very important subject of a deficiency of public revenue at Sierra Leone with the brief notice taken of it in our last. The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running.

Dr. Blyden says: ""West Africa has been in contact with Christianity for 300 years, and not one single tribe, as a tribe, has yet become Christian. Nor has any influential chief adopted the religion brought by the European missionary."" Of the natives of Cape Palmas he says: ""Upwards of forty years of untiring mission effort . . . has made them to hate rather than to admire Christian civilization."" Again, ""There is not a single spot along the whole coast, except perhaps the little island of Corisco, where Christianity has taken any hold among large numbers of the indigenous tribes. Even in nominally Christian settlements, such as Sierra Leone, Mohammedanism seems to be gaining ground on Christianity. Sierra Leone was a colony of liberated slaves, who from their first landing were subjected to Christian teaching, their children being brought up in Christian schools. When, in 1858, David Livingstone visited Sierra Leone, Islam, he says, was hardly known. Not long after this, we are informed by Mr. Johnson, a native clergyman, Islam was introduced by three zealous Moslem missionaries. In 1873 the Governor, Mr. Pope Hennessy, reported that a large proportion of the people—a majority in his opinion—had become converts to Islam. The number of Mohammedans in Sierra Leone now exceeds the whole number of liberated Africans who were landed from the slave ships. Three-fourths of these Mohammedans are converts from Christianity or Paganism, and not Moslems by birth. While Christianity is exotic, and supported by contributions from England, Dr. Blyden tells us that ""in Sierra Leone the Mohammedans, without any aid from Government, or any contributions from Mecca or Constantinople, erect their mosques, keep up their schools, and contribute to the support of missionaries from Arabia, Morocco, or Futah when they visit them."" In contrast with the self-reliance and independence of the Moslem propaganda, it will suffice to quote the last report of the Church Missionary Society, from which we learn that last year, in the whole of Western Africa, 290 missionaries and native agents, supported by the Society at a cost of £13,703 6s. 7d., baptized only 306 adult converts.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1887#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Progress of Islam in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The available evidence leads to the conclusion that the progress of Islam in Central Africa is more rapid than it is in India.

There is much independent testimony to the same effect. Professor Crummel, in his book on ""The Future of Africa,"" asserts ""Mohammedanism is rapidly and peaceably spreading through all the tribes of Western Africa."" Sir Richard Burton affirms that ""Mohammedans alone make proselytes in Africa."" Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness. In his recent work entitled ""Christianity, Islam, and the Negro Race,"" he says that in Western Africa ""Mohammedanism is rapidly superseding Paganism. The Arab missionaries in the interior go about without purse or scrip, and disseminate their religion by quietly teaching the Koran. In this way, silently and unobtrusively, they are causing princes to become obedient disciples and zealous propagators of Islam."" These Moslem missionaries go from town to town and village to village, simply as the bearers of God\'s truth. They take their mats or their skins and their manuscripts, and are followed by their pupils, who in every new Pagan town form the nucleus of a school and congregation. These preachers are the receivers, not the dispensers, of charity. In the interior missionaries are to be met from Kairwan, Cairo, Morocco, dependent for their food upon those whom they instructed. As to the results of this noiseless propaganda of these devoted men, Professor Blyden tell us that ""between Sierra Leone and Egypt the Mohammedans are the only great intellectual, moral, and commercial power. . . . Islam has taken possession of and shaped the social, political, and religious life of the most intelligent tribes. . . . No one can travel any distance in the interior without finding that Islam is the ruling influence."" ""From Senegal to Lagos, over 2,000 miles, there is scarcely an important town where there are not at least one mosque and active representatives of Islam."" ""Throughout Mohammedan Africa education is compulsory. A man might now travel across the Continent from Sierra Leone to Cairo, or in another direction from Lagos to Tripoli, sleeping in a village every night, except in the Sahara, and in every village he would find a school."" The statements of Mr. Bosworth Smith are to the same effect. He says, ""At this day Mohammedan missionaries are meeting everywhere with a marked success which is denied our own.""
