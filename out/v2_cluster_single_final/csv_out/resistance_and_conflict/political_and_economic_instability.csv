9,"Alliances and hostilities involving the Ashantees and various local groups, such as the Awoonlahs and Akims, significantly disrupted the political stability of the region.","The claim that alliances and hostilities involving the Ashantees and various local groups, such as the Awoonlahs and Akims, significantly disrupted the political stability of the region is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with some differences in details. The General History of Africa provides a broad overview of the Asante's efforts to assert political domination over other Akan peoples, leading to frequent clashes and wars, particularly with the Fante and the Akyem. These conflicts were driven by the Asante's desire for political hegemony and control over trade routes, which indeed disrupted regional political stability. However, the textbook does not specifically mention the Awoonlahs or Akims, focusing instead on the Asante's interactions with various Akan states. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details about the Ashantees' involvement in conflicts with the Aquamoo and Awoonlahs, as well as their alliances with these groups against other local tribes and the British protectorate. The articles highlight the instability caused by marauders from the Aquamoo, aided by the Ashantees, and the Ashantees' influence over the Awoonlahs, who have aligned themselves with the Ashantees. While the articles suggest potential Ashantee involvement in conflicts with the Akims, they do not provide specific details about the Akims' role, which is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, both sources corroborate the general assertion of disrupted political stability due to the Ashantees' significant role in regional conflicts and alliances, though they differ in the specific groups mentioned.","The General History of Africa textbook provides detailed accounts of the political dynamics involving the Asante and various local groups, but it does not specifically mention the Awoonlahs or Akims.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': 'Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance. It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

The great Asante kingdom then comprised three types of territorial unit.\nFirst, there was the central group of Asante chiefdoms, long united under the authority of the Asantehene by the same language, geographical contiguity, a vast network of family ties and affinities, a century of common military activities and pride in their spectacular achievements. In addition, and fundamentally, there was the mystical bond of belief in the protecting power of the Golden Stool of the Asante and the spirits of the Asantehene's ancestors.$^{11}$ Membership in the union took the following tangible forms: participation by chiefs of member states in the enthronement of the head of state of Kumasi, the Asante sovereign, and the swearing of an oath of allegiance to him; attendance at the general assembly (nhyiamu) of chiefs at which major political matters (such as war, peace and treaties) were discussed, and acceptance of the great Asante oath as the supreme instru› ment of justice for all of the Asantehene's territories. 12 These integrative institutions constituted the fundamental bases of the state machinery. They were to be found in all the Akan states as well as in Asante, which meant that the idea of the legitimacy of power through conquest had replaced that of political identity established through kinship and religion. The second category of states in this vast empire was therefore the Akan states bordering Asante territory. The peoples of these states understood the meaning of these institutions. They were expected to live under the Asantehene's authority so as to derive the same benefits from these institutions as the Asante peoples."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': 'Thus, in the centre and the north of the region covered in this chapter, existing political structures went into in a state of increasingly rapid decline in the nineteenth century and in some cases came to be dominated by new forces which had arisen mainly as a result of the Sokoto djihäd. These took advantage of the internal decay of the existing structures to establish themselves, before being swept away in their turn by foreign powers that were even more formidable.\nThere can be no single explanation for this kind of decline, such as might be offered if it were seen solely in terms of external influences, or as part of a predisposition towards colonization. There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest. Although none of them achieved this on any lasting basis, in each case the high point of their power coincided with their maximum north-south extension, even though the nucleus of the Bambara empire of Segu kept more closely to its west-east axis of the- valley of the Niger. However, during the nineteenth century, political instability and popu- lation movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu. Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler. Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The collapse of Old Oyó', 'content': ""The revolt of Afonja, the are-qna-hakanfo, or commander-in-chief of the Oyo army, who with the assistance of the Muslims among the Oyo Yoruba tried to declare himself an independent ruler at llorín, ushered in the last phase.

In the main there was a situation of generalized warfare and attendant insecurity for more or less the whole of the remainder of the century. This had the ultimate effect of disrupting trade on the coast and encouraging the intervention of Europeans in the politics of the interior.

As J. F. A. Ajayi put it, the 'collapse of the Old Oyo empire ... had important consequences for the Aja-speaking peoples to the west as well as for the Benin empire to the east.'$^{13}$ It marked the beginning of a more or less continuous period of warfare and generalized insecurity in the region under review. The inevitable adverse effects on European trade along the coast of the Bight of Benin created local conditions favourable to rival interventions by Britain, France and, eventually, Germany in the politics of the region.\nIt is impossible and perhaps unnecessary$^{14}$ to recount here details of the collapse of the Oyo empire. Suffice it to point out that as in the case of other similarly well-established and long-lived states, this was not a sudden affair. The signs of decline were already visible in the eighteenth century; and they steadily intensified in the first two decades of the nineteenth.\nInternal factors which manifested themselves so clearly in the struggle for power between successive alafins and the lineage chiefs, beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century, became progressively complicated by the effects of externally based stimuli deriving from the decline of the overseas slave trade and, more significantly,the southward extension of the djihäd of 'Uthman dan Fodio.\nAlready m the eighteenth century, paradoxically also the era of Qyo's greatest expansion and the zenith of its power, the empire had begun to show itself to be a deteriorating structure and militarily and territorially vulnerable. The rebellion which the Egba successfully staged under Lisabi, their legendary hero, in c. 1774, was followed by the defeat of the Oyo army by Borgu and Nupe in 1783 and 1791 respectively. The collapse of the empire in c. 1835 followed a period of complete deterioration of the internal political situation featuring a series of short-lived and largely unsuccessful alafins including Aole and Maku and ending in a protracted interregnum of close to two decades."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""The most interesting and most significant of these depositions were those that occurred in 1932, when all the asafo companies in Akyem Abuakwa combined to depose all the main divisional chiefs of the state and went on to prefer deposition charges against the Omanhene himself, Nana Sir Ofori Atta. It is interesting to note that the action of the asafo was precipi› tated by the decision of the Akyem Abuakwa State Council to approve the Native Administration Revenue measure proposed by the Colonial administration which was to give the council power to impose a levy on its subjects. As Simensen has shown, the list of charges preferred against the Omanhene show 'an increased awareness of the commoners that many of their troubles arose from the fact that the chiefs were being integrated into the administrative structure of the Colonial Government, and thereby removed from popular control'.$^{20}$ Thus the action of the asafo was directed as much against the colonial administration as it was against the traditional rulers. It is significant that it was only the timely intervention of the colonial rulers that saved Ofori Atta himself, though he conceded some of the demands by, for instance, admitting three members of the Akyem Abuakwa Scholars Union to the State Council in 1933.\nThe other method that the rural folk adopted was the use of cocoa hold› ups.

Rivals frequently replaced each other in quick succession, ruling alternately or even simultaneously, each with his own clan and capital.

But$^{ c}$Abd al-Djalfl proved too powerful for Ottoman purposes when he initiated contacts with commercial interests in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrating that he had at least the potential to threaten the prosperity of Tripoli. \'All Askar used diplomatic contacts to discredit \'Abd al-Djalfl in the eyes of his allies, who recognized the threat posed by a concentration of power. On three critical occasions when$^{ c}$Abd al-Djalfl faced Ottoman forces on the battlefield in 1840 and 1841, he was ""deserted and turned upon by former allies. In the final fight,$^{ c}$Abd al-Djalfl was killed and his forces nearly wiped out, but the defeated Awläd Sulaymän fled south along the caravan route from the Fezzän to Borno. Previously \'Abd al-Djalfl had formed marriage alliances with important families in Borno as~part of a strategy of building a commercial empire that would have included contacts in the Sudanese kingdom. Capitalizing on these alliances, surviving Awläd Sulaymän took up positions on the nomadic frontier of Borno, where they were of use to the Borno ruler to block the depredations of the Tuareg. But in 1850 the Awläd Sulaymän were soundly defeated by these nomadic foes. Twice in a decade they had nearly been annihilated, but they survived to become the scourge of trade and of neighbouring nomads and agricultural people. They augmented their numbers by assimilating slaves taken in raids and by calling on their former soff allies from the Syrte and the Fezzän. 9', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in the Maghrib and the Sahara, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The prevailing system and mounting opposition > An anticipation of future events: the Rïf Republic', 'content': ""To describe as a 'revolt' the national struggle which the Rïf leader Muhammad ben 'Abd al-Khattâbï ('Abdel Karîm) brought to a resounding climax in 1925-6, and to treat it as a mere episode, is to underrate the significance of facts which we now recognize as the forerunners of much later developments. 25 The Rïf had never given up the struggle.

In this chapter I will, however, outline only the political structures and general developments within the caliphate and Borno in the belief that these largely determined the shape of the region's common history.\nIn the past fifteen years almost every state in the region has been the subject of at least one, more or less detailed, historical study, and almost without exception these studies have been confined to political develop› ments. More recently religious and now economic themes have been taken up, but despite the quantity of material available there are still large gaps both in our data and in our understanding. This chapter does not attempt a synthesis of all these studies; it is meant instead to suggest a framework for understanding the history of the region in the years 1820 to 1880 and for opening some further avenues for research.\nThe emphasis here is put on the period 1820-80, the period when relatively stable government had been re-established following the fighting, the famines and the dislocation of civil society during the period of wars known as the djihad. But by way of introduction, the period c.17751820 will be summarized in three sections: the first, c.1775-95, when the expression of discontent among the Muslim reformist party in such states as Gobir was both peaceful and successful; the second, tr.1795-1810, when the clash of interests and ideas pushed the various parties involved in state affairs into a full-scale war; and the third, c. 1810-20, when the new governments sought to cope with the consequences of war, in some cases trying out new methods of administration, in others trying out new sites for settlement. The real achievement of the administrations after f.1820 was their success in bringing back to the region a stability that was the foundation for an unprecedented economic boom: a period of growth on a scale not seen in the region since perhaps the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Somaliland > Local protest movements', 'content': ""By and large, Somali resistance in the inter-war period in the European colonies and in the Ethiopian-occupied Ogaden was local in nature and at no time involved all Somali people.

The innovation of western education in the Protectorate was interpreted by religious leaders as an instrument for Christian missionary activities and consequently a threat to Islam. The attempts to foster such education in 1920 and 1935 aroused fierce resentment that culminated in two riots: at Burao in 1922 and Baro in 1936. On the latter occasion the newly-appointed British director of education was greeted with a shower of stones. 40 Equally significant were the local risings against French colonialism. Both the Afar, and the Isa Somalis, the two main ethnic groups in French Somaliland, displayed a hostile attitude towards colonial administration. The Afar Sultanates of Tadjüra and Gobaad were particularly active in this respect. The French had in fact summarily deported the Sultan of Gobaad to Madagascar in 1931. 41 The Sultan of Awsa, who had for long opposed French penetration in the area, had his own grievances during the inter-war period. French control of the region between the coast and the Ethiopian frontier deprived him of the revenues he had formerly derived from the local people and the caravan trade. Hence Sultan Yayü ambushed and arrested Lippmann, the newly appointed French governor at Dikhil. His successor, Albert Bernard, and sixteen of his Somali troops were murdered at Morheito in 1935. The activism of the Sultan of Awsa further increased after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 and Rome's backing of Awsa's territorial claims at the expense of France. 42 The arbitrary colonial partition of Somali frontiers was done without consulting the clansmen concerned and with little or no account of clan distribution or grazing needs. The Gadabursi and Isa clans, for example, were divided between Britain and Ethiopia, and, in the case of the Isa, France also.

Conversely the relative relaxation of tension contributed indirectly to the disorders of 1845-55 and their containment.\nIn the second period, when competition was economic rather than political, Borno tended to develop a political system in which clientage and individual advancement were important principles, whereas the Sokoto government developed groups with corporate interests and kept an Islamic, if no longer strongly millenarian, commitment with which to limit those interests and provide a moral yardstick. The relative dynamism and the greater natural wealth of the caliphate tended to drain Borno economically, though the detente may also have opened greater opportunities for Borno farmers and traders to supply the expanding market of the caliphate.

This does not appear to have been long left in doubt, for the advance-guard of King Mensah\'s force was found in possession of a Djuabin village, the people of which had been induced to join the opposite ranks. Assafoo-agay\'s men were fired upon, and one of them shot; they did not return the fire, but attempted to capture some of the Kumasi men, but were not successful. Since then, we learn, that Assafoo-agay has sent to Mensah to complain of this, but instead of obtaining redress, his messengers were treated with contumely. This conduct has led the King of Djuabin to send down messengers to Governor Strahan to acquaint him with all that has occurred, and to inform the Government that if the peace be broken it will not have been brought about by him.\n\n""Information has reached us also that the Gamans, and other former tributaries of Ashanti, inland, have sent to Assafoo-agay to make common cause with them against the Kumasi people, as they are determined to completely break up the power of the King of Ashanti; and if the Djuabins will not join them in the enterprise, they will take the field against Assafoo-agay and the King of Ashanti as their common foes.\n\n""It is rumoured that the Akims will join the Djuabins if Assafoo-agay resolves on fighting; and from all we can learn, fight he will, unless Governor Strahan directs otherwise.\n\n""The interior tributaries of Ashanti are longing to reach the sea-coast; they wish to destroy the power of Ashanti, so that they may be able to come down here to trade in peace, and the road into the interior be opened to commercial enterprise. Edin Kera, the King of Gaman, is exceedingly anxious to have the sole obstacle in the way of his people passing by the direct route to the Coast removed, and knowing, as he does now, that the power of Ashanti has been considerably weakened, he will not fail to take advantage of the favourable opportunity. He awaits the reply of Assafoo-agay, and the latter is now only desirous of learning the views of the Government, before deciding on the course of action to be adopted by him.\n\n""Reports from King Mensah state that two of his villages have been destroyed by the Djuabins.\n\n""We learn also that the Akims and other border tribes are likely to join the Djuabins and others, and that the Government declines to interfere one way or the other in this affair.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-08-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1875#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Revolt in Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""On the 10th inst. a messenger arrived from the King of Ashanti to the Administrator, to inform him that the Kings of Juabin and Becqueh were in revolt, and refused to attend Calcali's summons to view his return to the capital, and, further, that they threatened to attack him if he attempted to use force.

Soon afterwards a messenger from Kumassie arrived at Kyebi in due form (i.e., with a gilt sword, as a sign that he is sent by the King of Ashantee), who said that \'the Ashantees will not fight with Ata—they are not Ata\'s enemies.\' But the Akim do not believe him, and keep a strict watch at the frontiers, as it might be a ruse. The messenger further stated: \'Agyemang (the chief of Soedru, who was in former times under Ashantee rule, but withdrew to Akim, and is therefore not a good friend of Ashantee, but attached to the English Government) has killed an Ashantee man, and has stigmatised others by cutting marks in their faces, as the Donkos have them (which are slaves in our country), and has sent them back to Ashantee. He intended to hint to the King of Ashantee that he considers him not better than a despised Donko. This made Kwako Duah, King of Ashantee, angry, who has sent his warriors to catch Agyemang. But this wicked man has run away to Fantee. Therefore Kwako Duah has sent a messenger to Ata, to tell him that he has nothing to fear.\' This is the message.

At the beginning of the last century the Ashantees, who are supposed to have come from the interior and to have been compelled to move southward by a pressure from thence, attacked and subdued some of the more powerful of the tribes who now form the northern part of the Protectorate. Moving steadily onwards, about 1760 they had extended their conquests so far south as to excite some apprehension in the minds of the European settlers on the coast; and in 1800 had forcibly subdued the whole country from the seaboard of the Assinee River on the west, to the mouth of the Volta on the east, excepting only a small crescent embracing the Fantees, and a few other small tribes situated immediately in rear of the settlements.\n\nEmboldened by the success which had hitherto attended their progress, and encouraged no doubt by the hope of acquiring, or at least sharing the benefits which they soon found resulted from a closer contact with Europeans, the Ashantees, at the commencement of the present century, attacked the Fantees and the remaining unconquered tribes whom the settlers, with a selfish but mistaken regard for their own interest, left to their fate.\n\nIn 1807 the Ashantees were masters of the whole country, and had even attacked and taken one of the European settlements. With the British they came once into collision, but were repulsed, and their further aggressions were averted by an engagement on the part of the authorities not to assist the Fantees. During the next few years so bitter was the yoke imposed on the conquered nations, that several of them combined and revolted against it, but without success; the Ashantees not only maintained their hold over the country, but even threatened Cape Coast, whose safety was only purchased by discreditable concessions. This state of things lasted until 1817, the unhappy Fantees continuing to suffer the greatest oppression at the hands of their conquerors, when it was thought by the authorities at Cape Coast advisable to attempt to negotiate with the Ashantees, with the view of establishing peace on a secure footing, and promoting the prosecution of lawful trade. The mission which was sent was much struck, in passing through Assin and Fantee, with the traces of desolation which the Ashantees had everywhere left behind: ""Not a vestige of cultivation was to be seen, and heaps of ruined villages appeared on every side, round which the miserable natives stalked with the gaunt and sullen aspect of famine and despair.""', 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letter from Kpong', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Alas, dear Mr. Editor!

Mr. Editor is aware of the Tekemans and Gyawomans being portions of the Fantees who remained when a portion made up their minds for the journey towards the South. Tekeman is the root of Fantees and Gyawomans. After the departure of the two portions, Fantes and the Gyawomans, the few remains of Tekeman grew up into a good-sized State and became wealthy; forming in a position a neighbouring tribe of the Inkuransah State. When the Ashantees had gained the power from the Denkerahs, Tekeman attracted their attention very much. Tekeman had accumulated so much riches that a sister of its King, Ammiyow, Djuamanwah by name, expressed a desire to know what poverty was. The avarice of Ashantees grew so high that their King, Opokoowaree, the second on the stool, engaged Baffoo, the King of his allied State, Inkuransah, to contrive a scheme to subjugate Tekeman. Baffoo was known to be full of schemes, and his name is preserved in Ashanti with the reputation that none can beat him in cunning. Baffoo like, his first step, after bargaining with Opokoowaree as to what should be his portion of the booty when he had succeeded, was to seek an intimacy with Ammiyow. This he gained. Seeing that he had fully secured the confidence of Ammiyow, he hinted to him that there was a preparation of war against him in Kumasi, in ambiguous phrase, which moved Ammiyow to inquire what it meant. Baffoo, who knew what he was about, gave Ammiyow the literal meaning of the phrase, and desired him to act in like manner, and that was to bury all the muskets he had in the State just at the outskirt of his capital, or on the way by which the enemies were to enter, and on their approach to these muskets, his crying out ""Muskets arise!"" would be a sufficient charm to kill every one of them. Ammiyow did as he was advised by his friend. Baffoo then acquainted Opokoowaree with his success, and desired an army to be sent to plunder the country. On their approach, Ammiyow and people, inspired with vain confidence, vehemently cried to the dumb muskets; there was, however, no sign of enemies being killed, but of their being rather invigorated to butcher them. Ammiyow and Djuamanwah were taken to Kumasi; and as it was agreed, the capital belonged to Opokoowaree, but all dependent towns were placed in charge of Baffoo.

The absence of specific references to the Mandingo tribes and Mabba's wars is a notable difference, suggesting that while the claim is partially supported by the general themes of instability and religious conflict, it lacks direct corroboration from the textbook regarding these particular events and groups.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding persistent political instability and religiously motivated conflicts impacting West African societies. The articles mention the wars involving the Mandingo tribes and the religiously motivated conflicts led by Mabba, a fanatical Mohammedan, who preached a crusade against unbelievers, causing significant disturbances in the Gambia region. Additionally, the articles describe disputes over resources, such as the conflict between the Karoboe and Aqunoo tribes over the Volta ferry, which led to fighting and required intervention from the Governor. These examples align with the claim that such conflicts significantly affected the stability and development of the region. However, the articles also highlight other factors contributing to instability, such as colonial interventions, trade disruptions, and the slave trade, which are not explicitly mentioned in the claim.

There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone.

Amin is here describing resistances which were directed against an African aristocracy, but which were also a response to French economic aggression.\nAs the nineteenth century developed, Amin goes on to argue, the French ceased to demand slaves and came to demand raw materials and agricultural produce instead. In Waalo they began to experiment with agricultural plantations but these failed because of 'the resistance of the village com› munities'. The French could not succeed in overcoming resistance to proletarianization until they had occupied the whole area and were able to use continuous force. But this colonial conquest came so late in the progression that resistance to it was not very effective.

While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

The Portuguese, for example, exploited their role as suppliers of weapons to pressure the Chikunda bands to recognize Lisbon's limited authority over their territory.$^{62}$ Similarly, the Sena began to rely so heavily on their Arab allies that they jeopardized their sovereign status. 63 Even the powerful Bemba were not totally immune to pressures from Arab and Swahili traders. 64 Moreover, with the abolition of the slave trade, those classes or strata within them who profited from the trade - the aristocracy, merchants, warlords and landlords - searched desperately for new commodities such as wax, coffee, groundnuts, and vegetable oils which they could extract from their subordinates or acquire through commerce in order to ensure a constant supply of European consumer goods and weapons necessary to maintain their privileged position. In some regions this legitimate com› merce offered new opportunities for aspiring itinerant traders to accumulate capital and for the growth of peasant agriculture. To the extent that particular classes or strata successfully made this transition, they merely perpetuated or extended their dependent position in a world economy over which they had no control."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 27, 'article_title': 'The Eastern Gold Coast Districts', 'full_section_title': 'The Eastern Gold Coast Districts', 'last_edit_date': '10-08-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-6', 'issue_date': '22_11_1862', 'content': 'Sir,—This year the river Volta has overflowed its banks. All the towns bordering on it have been swept away, Kpong not excepted. My cotton establishment, including two houses and several huts, have shared in its fate. A part of the Government House has fallen down, and some property belonging to the agricultural society, in cotton, is destroyed. My loss is considerable, but precaution was taken to remove the cotton machinery and my moveable properties to this place. At Aquamu, and beyond Kpong, the lives of eight human beings were lost by the upsetting of canoes.\n\nThe state of affairs with us here is truly deplorable. These eastern districts are in a more disorganised condition than the western. There has been a series of misfortunes and troubles for some years past, but in this year they have been more apparent. The early part of it was inaugurated with a civil fight in Aquapem. Chiefs and people were killed. Government satisfied itself by fining them 400l., but no effective measures were taken to put a stop to the recurrence of such excesses. Every combustible for another civil fight is in preparation, and there is only wanting a little fire to kindle the whole into a flame. Look at Kroboe now. And on the river Volta _the slave-trade is revived and carried on with such vigour_ as has not been witnessed for some time past. Kpong is the depot for it. The authority of the place is usurped by the Addahs and Anwoolas, a set of savage robbers of human beings, kidnapping, panyarring, and oppressing to an incredible extent, _and that within the limits of British jurisdiction_. The other day, in broad daylight, at Kpong, seven poor people, who came from Aquapem to buy salt, were seized by the Anwoolas residing there and carried off in a canoe, probably to be shipped in a slave ship. Now and then we see slaves gagged, or put in log, passing by Kpong to the slave coast. Here and there, at Aquamu or Assuchary, a human being is commanded to shoot himself, or is massacred as a charge of witchcraft. A\n\nMissionary from Odumase, the other day, was the means, at his own expense, of rescuing one from the jaws of a most cruel death at the latter place.\n\nIn April last Kroboe was invaded by the Addahs and Aquamus, on account of the murders committed by them (people stolen and sacrificed to their Fetish). The latter were satisfied with about 300 heads of cowries (150 dollars), and the murderer given up to them, whom they sold to the Anwoolas, and he has since gone to the slave ship. A chief, by name Jaga, and his son, were given up to the former, with about 800 heads of cowries (400 dollars). Even with this they are not satisfied, but want twelve men more, and are now threatening Kroboe with an invasion.'}, {'id': 179, 'article_title': 'GENERAL OBSERVATIONS', 'full_section_title': 'GENERAL OBSERVATIONS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-12', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'We fear the Ashantee war will be a tedious and expensive one.

Unless officers have previously given evidence of great ability, we do not think it ought at all to follow, as a matter of course, that those who may happen to be on the spot whenever and wherever hostilities occur should retain the command in face of the enemy. When the first news of hostilities comes, attended by that of some rapid and able action on their part, giving indication of talent and energy, we should be the last to wish to deprive them of an opportunity of gaining distinction. Otherwise it seems to us to be one of the first duties of the home authorities to send out some superior officer without delay. We think, too, the Governmental staff ought to be complete. The Governor ought to have at his command all necessary assistance. A heavy responsibility rests upon him. And especial care should be taken in such a climate as that of the Gold Coast that he is not left alone. A wise supervision and direction leaves as little as possible to accident. As the rainy season had commenced, we fear we shall hear of great sickness among the officers and West India troops sent up into the bush. Unless for immediate action with the enemy, they ought not to be there. We hope to hear by the next mail that the Fort of Quittah has been reoccupied.

There is a Roman Catholic church, and a small conventual establishment in connexion with it; the Wesleyans have a chapel at Bathurst and another at McCarthy's Island.

The presence of the French traders who declared themselves prisoners, although they were allowed frequent communication with ships of war carrying the French flag, has so entirely tied the hands of the Commodore that the season for action is now rapidly passing away without any decisive steps being taken. The blockade, too, is imperfectly maintained, as the lengthened withdrawal of the greater portion of the ships from other parts of the station merely to maintain a blockade is not considered advisable. Large lines of coast belonging to neutral chiefs are not watched by our men-of-war, the word of the chiefs having been given that they will not supply Dahomey; but while they see us hesitating, and can feel the power of King Gelélé, it is not to be expected that such promises will be faithfully kept. One chief found to his cost that it was unwise to adhere to England while Dahomey was unsubdued, for his refusal to give supplies to the King resulted in a raid upon him and the destruction of a village, the capture of the women, and the slaughter of a number of men. Had we been free to act, a force might have been landed within a very short distance of Abomey early in December, and then Gelélé would in all probability have come to terms.\n\nIntelligence by the British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamship Gambia, arrived 25th February, is to the effect that trade on the Coast generally was dull, but that at Bathurst the ground nut crop had been larger than was expected, and it was believed a good trade would be done during the season. The blockade at Whydah was strictly maintained, but apparently with little effect on the King of Dahomey, as it was currently reported at Lagos that he was getting ready for his annual raid on Abeokuta, and this in the face of a warning to him from the Governor of Lagos that England would not permit him to molest that district. There had been some disturbances near Bonny. A tribe in the oil district captured some of the Ekriko women, and treated them in a most brutal manner, massacring several of them. The Ekriko people asked the Bonny chiefs for assistance, and the latter sent 1,000 armed men to help them. The country of the offending tribe was so little known, however, that not much could be done against it, though a village was burnt, and several plantations destroyed. It was expected that this would settle the matter, as all was quiet when the Gambia left. At New Calabar a large fair was to have been held, but it had been postponed from time to time, partly owing to the Ekriko dispute.

The French authorities have annexed all the territory along the coast-line from Loango to Sette Cama. The residents have sent in copies of their title-deeds to the Governor of Loango. Surveyors are going down to make ground plans of the estates, and notice has been given that Custom-houses are to be established in all the ports, and duties will be imposed.

Some time after this, another steam launch happened to pass by on its way to Brass River, and those on board seeing something wrong, made inquiries, and found out the state of things. On arriving in Brass, the party in charge of the launch immediately communicated with the Europeans trading there, and they at once decided to proceed in a body to the scene of the capture. For this purpose they secured the services of the mission steamer Henry Venn, and, accompanied by Archdeacon Crowther, departed for the Niger.

Five days after he entered Mengo, and established himself on the top of a knoll, 800 yards from the Nile. This position gave him command of the situation. Captain Lugard made it evident that he would stand no nonsense. He had a difficult part to play, for he had made up his mind that Mwanga should sign a treaty acknowledging the supremacy of the Company and give it all commercial rights. On Dec. 26 the treaty was signed, but only for two years.

The treaty gives the Company the command of the situation, practical sense makes several suggestions as to the promotion of British interests, which will, no doubt, be followed. Captain Lugard gives a sad account of the devastation of the country as a result of the civil war. The country, it is evident, is capable of development, but progress is impossible until there is a settled government. With transport at £200 a ton to the coast, there can be no trade, for without exports there can be no imports. As a road to the territories lying towards Albert Nyanza, it must remain an important acquisition. The Company are bound to move on to the other lake, and in time establish themselves on the Upper Nile. Until the establishment of improved means of communication, the country can never be developed, nor the slave trade stopped. Under existing circumstances it costs £8 to send a load of 60lb. weight to the lake. Assuming that salt is being sent, the cost would be over 1s. 7d. per lb., and a trader would look for at least as much again as his profit in estimating the barter value of the salt. A railway would revolutionise all this, and at a 1d. per lb. could earn a fair freight. Thus a railway to Lake Victoria Nyanza need not be a purely benevolent enterprise.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Mandingos, who are the chief owners of the soil, are disposed to labour, but they employ their slaves to some extent in cultivation.

The local Government has carefully abstained from any interference in the civil and religious wars which the tribes in the neighbourhood periodically wage against each other, and whenever it has come into collision with them it has been for the vindication of its rights against their aggression; indeed, inquiry shows that in the greater number of instances in which interference has been called for of late years, the Pagans, and not the Moslems, have been the subject of it. There is no doubt but that Mohammedism is slowly but steadily making its way south, and that it will probably eventually exercise its sway over the whole of the countries in which we have established ourselves; but, although it is impossible not to hope that the day may be far distant, any attempt on our part to impede its progress would be as useless as it would be unjust.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

The disturbance was then quelled, and the ringleaders were captured. Several natives were killed on both sides during the fighting, and many dangerously wounded. In consequence of the disturbances, the mail steamer Senegal was unable to land any of her cargo.\n\nA Reuter\'s telegram, dated Cape Coast Castle, November 17th, states: ""Details of the riot at Winnebah on the 13th inst., which has already been noticed by cable, state that it arose from a dispute between two of the town companies. In the fighting which occurred, some 12 men lost their lives, and many were dangerously wounded. It appears there had been rivalry between No. 1 and No. 2 companies for some time past, and this was fanned to a flame by a fetish priest from Baracoo, a small town near Winnebah. The fight commenced by the throwing of stones, and finished with the use of cutlasses. Some of the dead found after the fight were literally hacked to pieces. As night came on fighting ceased, and about 10 o\'clock the District Commissioner, Captain Barnett, assisted by one of the European residents, entered the town with a small detachment of Houssa police, and captured over 100 prisoners, besides some two or three hundred muskets and all the fetish drums. It is thought that the prompt and decisive measures adopted by Captain Barnett averted a much more disastrous result, and prevented the possible destruction of the trading factories. In the fetish house was found a kind of pie made in a large brass pan, which upon being examined was found to contain portions of two human bodies. The skulls were smashed in, the victims having been killed by a heavy blow. They must have been dead about a week. All is now quiet. The prisoners have been sent to Accra for trial.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

They went up in a straight line north-east, and did not intend to alter their course due east till they had arrived at the ninth parallel of latitude already agreed to by the French and English some time ago. It seems that the French were not requested by the Governor of Lagos to retire from the British territory which they had invaded, but an intimation of the invasion was sent to England from Lagos. From England the French Government were communicated with, and they instantly telegraphed to their officers to retire from any English territory, and it was in obedience to these instructions that the French expedition from Porto Novo avoided the British Colony in their march inland. The Volta left Sierra Leone on Nov. 1. Much dissatisfaction prevailed amongst many of the chiefs of the Colony at what they considered an infraction of their rights by the Colonial Government, and they were still waiting for the arrival of the Governor, who was due on Nov. 15. From their point the grievance was very serious. Several months ago some half-a-dozen Natives were hanged by the Sierra Leone authorities for being members of a ""human leopard"" society and for killing several people. This was in the Imperi country, and the prompt measures adopted had the effect of stamping out the terrible crimes.

Fishermen and boatmen have been enticed from their canoes by the members of the society, who, after murdering them and stealing their belongings, feasted on their bodies. One man who was enticed on to the river bank, when fallen on by the ""human alligators,"" killed one of his assailants and wounded two others, but was eventually himself killed and eaten, excepting one of his legs, which was found in the river and identified by some marks upon it.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river. He will, however, be allowed an annual pension of £800 for life.\n\nThe principle having been laid down that Europeans may trade in the interior, it becomes imperative to assume definite authority over the district. The ""customs"" have been abolished, a uniform export duty of 2s. 6d. per ton being levied instead.

Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest.

Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu.

This move constituted a serious blow to the economic interests of Abomey. In 1889, the heir to the throne, Prince Kondo, informed the governor of the RiviŁres de Sud, Bayol, that the Fon people would never accept such a situation. In February 1890, Bayol ordered the occupa› tion of Cotonou and the arrest of all the Fon notables in the town. Prince Kondo, who had begun his reign in December 1889 under the name of Behanzin, reacted by mobilizing his troops. At the time, Abomey had a permanent army which, in peacetime, numbered 4000 men and women. In wartime military service was compulsory for all males, supported by the Amazons, who were dreaded female warriors.\nThe French garrison was attacked at dusk, at the same time as part of the army dispatched to the region of Porto Novo set about destroying the palm trees. According to Behanzin, those economic counter-measures quickly induced the French to sue for peace. On 3 October, Father DorgŁre presented himself in Abomey with proposals for peace. In return for the recognition of Cotonou as a French possession and the right of the French to levy custom duties and station a garrison of troops there, the French were to pay Behanzin an annuity of 20000 francs. The king accepted these terms and the treaty was signed on 3 October 1890. However, to defend the rest of his state, the king started to modernize his army.

However, the kingdom could not be said to have escaped the destructive influences of the nineteenth century. 30 By c. 1800 the kingdom consisted of the area approximating more or less to the eastern half of the Mono-Niger region east of a line drawn northsouth from Otun in Ekiti to the coast. The area embraced the eastern Yoruba states of Ekiti, Ondo and Qwo, the western Igbo communities west of the Niger delta; the Urhobo, Itsekiri and the Ijo in the south.

Further afield, Benin influence, if not suzerainty, was acknowledged all along the Atlantic coast as far west as Lagos and beyond. As with the Itsekiri, there was a widely acknowledged dynastic relationship between Benin and the ruling elites in most Awori-Yoruba and related Anago chiefdoms where (as in Ekiti, Owo and Ondo) there is still visible evidence of the Benin impact on titles and court ceremonials. 31 Benin is usually portrayed as having been in continuous decline in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, while recent research has shown that this decline was far from being continuous and was often punctuated by periods of revival and territorial expansion, there seems little doubt that in the three or four decades immediately preceding the loss of independence, the Benin kingdom underwent radical contraction because of a three-sided assault on its territory. The Fulbe djihad, which had knocked Old Oyo off its feet, also penetrated the northern and north› eastern part of the Benin kingdom. While the Fulbe, based in Nupe, forced such northern Edo groups as the Esan and Ivbiosakon to pay tribute to the emir of Bida and to be accessible for Islamic proselytization, the Djama'a from llorín raided into the northern Ekiti states.

The Benin kingdom began to feel the embarrassment of this development when its trading privileges in the coastal trade, especially its control over the com¬ merce on the Benin river in the western Niger delta, came to be challenged by European traders, mostly British, and the African middlemen, especially the Itsekiri and the Ijo. The eclipse of the Benin port of Ughoton dem¬ onstrated quite painfully to Benin that the days of its near monopoly of coastal trade had ended.\nThe coastal trade encouraged the spirit of political autonomy among the Itsekiri. This eventually led to a situation of war between the Olu of Warri and the qba of Benin, and the new wealth also nourished political conflicts within the Warri kingdom itself. There was, for example, so much rivalry and acrimony, so many succession disputes, protest migrations and the setting up of autonomous and rival power centres that for the rest of the century no generally acceptable successor could be found for the stool of the Olu of Warri when Akengbua, the incumbent from 1809, died in 1848. As with the Itsekiri kingdom, Agbor, whose monarchy had also been organized on the Benin model and operated as a Benin dependency, grew steadily into an autonomous state again largely under the influence of the new coastal trade. Ovonramwen, the last Oba of independent Benin, was determined to reinvigorate the kingdom and this policy included an expedition against Agbor with a view to re-asserting Benin authority there.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans.

He therefore thought that the best policy open to him was to neutralize the British with signs of friendship and thereby gain a free hand to deal with the imminent Belgian danger. He invited the British to establish a trading post in his kingdom. The invitation was made in the belief that the British would not be able to come, but that if they did he would fight them.

As there has not yet been time to organise the trade between Okeodan and Addo and the interior, and no settlement of difficulties with Abeokuta or discontinuance of war between the Egbas and Ibadans have taken place, trade continues in that depressed state which we have now for so long a time had occasion to lament. The Abeokutans are pursuing that policy which led to the destruction of the Adras and the Whydahs by Dahomey more than a century ago. They then refused to Dahomey all access to the sea coast, as the Abeokutans now desire to prevent the Ibadans from a similar advantage. Unless the Abeokutans take warning, this same spirit of monopoly (to which is allied the old kidnapping spirit which the Egbas have most systematically evinced in their conduct) will lead to the destruction of Abeokuta as anciently it did to that of Adra and Whydah. The Ibadans are too powerful a people to allow their just desires for free access to the sea coast to be continuously opposed with success. And in the interests of civilization, it is indispensable that Ibadan should have the free access she demands. Our letters from Okeodan and Addo fully bear out the contents of the important paper we publish in this present number relative to those places coming under the British protectorate. The late Lieutenant-Governor, Commander Glover, has indeed done good service, not only in preventing the undue extension of French influence towards Abeokuta, but also in establishing a counterpoise to Abeokuta, and destroying its best slave market. And we hope that Governor Freeman will in consequence have less difficulty in bringing about such an arrangement between the Ibadans, and Ijebus and Egbas, as will secure full, independent, and uninterrupted communication between Lagos and Ibadan and the important populous countries beyond.\n\nGovernor Freeman arrived out from England on the 22nd of November, and immediately resumed office. Commander Glover, late Lieutenant-Governor, is expected to return to England by the January mail steamer.\n\nThere has been fighting lately at Iperu, which the Ibadans tried to take. They were repulsed by the Egbas and Ijebus.\n\nWe perceive that some local Government offices held at Lagos by two of the native gentlemen who have been endeavouring to bring about peace between the Egbas and Ibadans, have been filled up by Governor Freeman with other parties, on the ground that the former are ""absent without leave.""

A messenger of the King of Dahomey went to him from Whydah, with special directions to see the Commodore *with his own eyes.* The following is the substance of the message he was charged to deliver: ""The King sends his best regards to the Commodore, and wishes him to come to Abomey. He does not like Captain Burton, and would not make a treaty with him, after having refused his friend the Commodore. The King will tell the Commodore all he wants, if he will come up to Abomey, and will send a message to the Queen of England.""\n\nAs on a previous occasion, the messenger was extremely well received by Commodore Wilmot, who, however, according to our informant, returned a rather severe, though wise and conciliatory, reply. It is understood to have been to this effect:—\n\n""Tell the King that I am glad to hear he is well, and give him my compliments. Tell him further that it is not likely the English Government will send another messenger to Abomey, because the King\'s conduct is not such as to prove that he is sincere. Presents have been made to him, and offers of friendship have been held out to him, with a real desire on the part of England to benefit Dahomey and Africa. We cannot go on in this ridiculous way. The King must give up the slave-trade, or he must prepare to see his ports blockaded, which must very soon have the desired effect, because all those things which are absolutely necessary to him now will be prevented from reaching the shore. He cannot live or feed his people without those things. He will not be able to sell his slaves, because they cannot be shipped. His wars with Abeokuta and others are consuming the strength of his kingdom, because many are killed, many made prisoners, many die—and who can replace them. If I stop his supplies, how can he exist? There is no cultivation and no produce of the soil. He and his people will starve, and his kingdom will be broken up. Tell him that all the kings and tribes round Dahomey are his enemies, and that if once the English blockade his coast they will be glad of the opportunity to rise against him and destroy him. Perhaps Abeokuta will do this. Who can say? Be sure you tell the King truly all that I have said, and that the advice of his best friend is that he should at once send his principal chiefs to Whydah, and make the treaty with me that the Queen of England requires.""\n\nOur correspondent says that the messenger acknowledged that all the Commodore had said was true—and there can be no doubt that he will faithfully report every word of it to the King.

We have reason to believe they have been urged on to these deplorable acts of violence by the instigation of the King of Jebu; and if such counsels continue to prevail with them, and the Bashorun and principal chiefs who act with him cannot control them, we look upon Abeokuta as in a very dangerous position.

There was not any regular pitched battle between them and the Egbas—nothing but skirmishes. It would seem they did not wish to give battle to the Egbas (who in their turn did not force them to one), but that they rather thought so to distress them by ambushes, by a long encampment in their country, by foraging and plundering, as to reduce them by starvation and force them to surrender. The Egbas have not shown much courage this time. They seem to be much afraid of the Dahomans now, and unable to unite and give them a heavy blow. Party spirit is rife. The war chiefs seem generally to forget the public welfare in their own private schemes and ends. Traitors also are said to be in the camp. There is no universally acknowledged Ruler. The elect of the soldiery does not please the Council. Their camps, during the time the Dahomans invaded them, were within their walls. The two or three chiefs who, with small bands of soldiers, showed the Dahomans now and again a little firing outside the walls, were not under the orders of any leader. The Egbas want some such men as Shodeke and other native rulers, whose memory stands high among them, who would make them forget their petty differences and jealousies, and unite their many tribes and townships together. They have numbers and other advantages on their side. United and filled with patriotism and a righteous indignation, they might so chastise their inveterate foes that they would be glad to sit at home and lead a quiet life. It is computed that since the commencement of their periodical attacks on Abeokuta they have laid waste over twenty rising villages which would have by this time become large towns. A considerable number of the inhabitants of these places who were captured were, as is generally the case, sacrificed to their gods. On this last occasion a detachment of them were under orders to attack a village. The village would have been carried but for the timely aid of a Christian war chief with a handful of men, and that of a heathen one with his own. Christian soldiers elect to fight under the leadership of a Christian war chief, because they cannot join their heathen fellows in their supplications to their false gods for success to their arms. Their small number was sufficient to force the enemy to retreat. They were taken by surprise, though the number of Egbas repulsing them was very great, and therefore retreated quickly. This was the last of the Dahoman army. They broke up their camp after this, and left the country. They had encamped long—indeed, longer than they had ever before done. The river Ogun, which they must cross on their way home, was rising fast, and they had sustained some losses. There was nothing to gain, but everything to lose, by a longer stay; therefore they broke up their camp and left the country after the last disadvantageous encounter with Egbas. Some run-away Egba captives say the Dahomans once feigned to have left their camp and gone away, by kindling large fires about it, such as might be kindled by an army in this country when there is a general break-up, whilst many of them were in ambush, waiting for such Egbas as might come to the camp. The Egbas saw the fire from the town, and were suspicious about it; the ruse did not take with them. The number of killed and wounded on both sides is not known, but it could not have been great; but many Egbas are captives today in Dahomey, and if Egbas have Dahoman captives, they must be very few. This Dahoman affair has seriously disturbed the course of progress in every good thing. All is quiet now at Abeokuta, but Dahomey may be in arms again in March next. As a rule, no one at Abeokuta is free from anxiety between that month and May, as that is the time when the King of Dahomey sends out his soldiers, robbers, and spoilers on their mission of ruin and destruction. I hope it will not be long before Abeokuta recovers itself, and is able to prevent him from ever encamping on its soil. The small ships engaged in the Niger trade have recently left this for that river. Bishop Crowther left in one of them for his annual missionary journey.

In Mr. Sketchley's book on Dahomey, or rather his account of his visit to Abomey, and his many months' detention there, we are informed that the promise by the warriors during the customs, to conquer, subdue, slaughter and bring to execution at Abomey the unfortunate people of the Egba countries, and to pillage and destroy the town of Abeokuta, was the most grateful of all tributes that could be paid by them to the Dahoman Nero, Gelélé then, and now, we believe, occupying the royal stool. The checks heretofore received by the Dahomans before Abeokuta, and the great losses sustained by them there in their several efforts to obtain an entry within its detested walls, rankle bitterly in the heart of the baffled despot, and in the hearts of his people. In the last attack, the flower of the Amazon corps, that celebrated band of female warrior demons, were cut off. This has added increased bitterness to the Abeokuta cup; and we are not surprised, though we are grieved, to hear that the ruthless horde of Dahoman murderers are again committing their customary atrocities among the defenceless Egba towns and plantations. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the loss to Abeokuta by the constant menace and repeated inroads of Dahomey. The feeling of insecurity, except within the near neighbourhood of the town, which is thereby created, limits the area of plantations, and consequently diminishes the production of cotton, palm oil, ground-nuts, Benni seed, and other useful and valuable commodities. Nor this alone. For some time before the yearly period at which the Dahomans are wont to make their inroads, all sorts of alarming rumours are circulated. Long before the Dahomans have crossed the river which separates them from Abeokutan territory, the news is spread in the capital that farms and villages have been sacked and destroyed, and such of their inhabitants as had not been killed or escaped had been kidnapped as future victims at future Dahomey customs. Terror everywhere prevails in the open country. The hand of industry is paralyzed. Even the transport of merchandise toward Lagos is stopped; and the note of preparation for resistance to the invasion is heard on every hand, all rushing to the defence of the town of Abeokuta, the capture of which is supposed to be the ultimate object of the Dahomans. If the news which we publish be correct, it would seem that some small bodies of men have gone, or been dispatched, to reconnoitre the invaders, and that one or more of these little expeditions has come to grief in face of the enemy. It is a lamentable condition of affairs that a people who now desire nothing better than to be at peace with their neighbours, and dedicate themselves earnestly and entirely to productive agricultural pursuits and trade, should have to undergo an annual Dahomey scare, and every second or third year a real Dahomey invasion. Some remedy must be found sooner or later for this state of things. We have some suggestions to make on the subject, but have not space for them and the arguments with which they must necessarily be accompanied in our present number. We have no apprehension that the Dahomans can ever succeed in their plans against Abeokuta; but the idea of taking that place so predominates in the minds of both King and people, who consider the former repulses they have sustained as a national disgrace that can only be wiped out by success, that unless some other means yet untried be found to deter them, these menaces and attacks will be continued until Dahomey becomes too weak any more to attack and the Egbas become strong enough to capture and destroy Agbome. We purpose, therefore, recurring to this subject in our July number, before the publication of which we hope to hear of another Dahoman defeat."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1875#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahoman Raid on Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Lagos, April 26, 1875.\n\nDear Sir,—You will be sorry to hear that the Dahomans are out again this year in one of their hunting expeditions against Abeokuta.

But, alas! it seems that with it, as with the possessed maniac whose healing by our Blessed Saviour is recorded in the Scriptures of Divine Truth, Satan will, ere he relinquish his mighty hold (as he will ultimately be compelled to do), first rend and tear it, and make it an object for compassion and pity. His hold over the African countries for ages upon ages past has been an enfeebling and a ruinous one. But the finger of God is now manifestly stretched forth over them, and the glorious work of their deliverance and emancipation will be accomplished. We had great hope at one time from the labours of the Church Missionary Society in Abeokuta, which, under the direction, as we believe, of unerring and infinite Wisdom, it had chosen for the centre of its operations against the kingdom of the Evil One in the Egba countries; and although, as might have been expected, there has been a check in its onward course of success as a divine agent in freeing the victim from the hand of the spoiler, it has, nevertheless, sown the seed from which the harvest of power will one day appear. As shown by the letter of a Lagos correspondent in this our September number, the only small successful effort made by the Egbas during the late Dahoman invasion, was by a Christian war chief with his few Christian soldiers, which had the effect of precipitating the retirement of the cruel invaders to their own country. Abeokuta now breathes again. The public heart pulsates with the regularity which proceeds from a feeling of security. But unless some measures more efficacious than any hitherto, be adopted by or for her, that feeling of security will be only for a few months. The cloud of fear will then again overshadow her; her territory will be again invaded, her farms pillaged and burned, and her children carried away by a cruel and remorseless foe (a sister servant of Satan) to captivity and slaughter at Abomey. Even during those few months of security, the paralyzing influence of a future fear will arrest the hand of willing industry; labour will not be applied, where the results that should reward it may be destined to fall into the possession of the dreaded enemy; and soil which might be made fruitful will remain barren and uncultivated, to the increase of individual poverty and national enfeeblement. All this might be avoided. Security might be obtained, and the signal chastisement of the enemy be made certain. But for this there must be a generally acknowledged supremacy of one man, or of a body of men, in Abeokuta. There must be some authority which commands all the will and the obedience of the community. A house divided against itself is on the verge of ruin. As union is strength, so discord is feebleness; as union would help toward victory and power, so discord must precipitate defeat and ruin. We want to see Abeokuta achieve victory and power. But to achieve an end, means must be used. If Abeokuta be so divided that, of its own volition, it is unable to take the first steps toward that condition of security which is indispensable to the strength that it needs, the educated children of Abeokuta—the children whom God, in His all-wise providence, led to Sierra Leone through the holds of slave-ships—they and their descendants, elevated by education, and in many instances, we hope, by personal Christianity, ought to go in to her aid. We said in our July number that the security and entire delivery of Abeokuta from the cruel pest and terror of Dahomey, ought to be an object near to the heart of all of them. We desire to enforce this upon them. Abeokuta should be the central spot toward which all their desires and affections tend. They should be all apostles and helpers in the work of her deliverance and strength. Their souls should know no peace until Abeokuta become a praise, a joy, and a glory in Western Africa. How? they will ask, or rather we hope they will ask. The first step seems to us to be, by an union among them, with this end, object, and aim—such an union as they have often been accused of in Sierra Leone, for advancing each other's individual interests against the community at large. But this union should be an open and avowed one. All should be members of an Abeokuta club—all, whether at Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, Lagos, or elsewhere—to bring their united strength and influence to bear on the great question of Abeokutan security and pre-eminence. The golden cord to unite them must be Christianity. There can be no deliverance and independence for Abeokuta without this. Heathenism can never accomplish it. We see nothing in the uncontrolled heathenism of Abeokuta to entitle it to any preference over that of Abomey.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Dahoman Raid on Abeokuta', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The constantly recurring raids of the Dahomans in Egba territory, even so far as to the vicinity of the town of Abeokuta, call on us for something more than the mere cursory notice accorded to them in our June number. We then expressed a hope that ere this we should hear of another Dahoman defeat by the Egbas. This hope has not been realized; but we have news of the retirement of the Dahomans, without their having ventured any attack on the town. We presume, therefore, that they have returned to their own blood-stained land with fresh hordes of victims for those cruel annual customs in which both King and people take a childish and savage delight. This confirms our impression that, notwithstanding the vain glorious boasting, and annual threats and promises made during the progress of those customs, they have arrived at a full consciousness of their inability ever to force an entry into the town which they have so often during their orgies devoted to slaughter and destruction. The Dahomans cannot take Abeokuta; that is clear. But, unhappily, another thing is equally clear, and that is, the Egbas have not sufficient dependence on themselves, in conflict with the Dahomans in open country, to induce them to take the offensive against the invaders, in the hope that by inflicting a severe chastisement they might destroy their power and appetite for further devastating and panyaring inroads. This is greatly to be deplored. Many years ago we expressed our sorrow at so unsatisfactory a state of things. When Great Britain annexed Lagos, we entertained the hope that, among the advantages which the Egbas would derive from that annexation, the putting an end to those Dahoman raids within their territory would be one. It ought to have been one. The powerful and the wise ought to have so conciliated the ignorant and the weak, as to bring about such friendly relations that in attacking the one, the Dahomans should have known they were incurring the displeasure of the other. This was one of the results of annexation that we desired and expected. When we saw, at a later period, that not only had this not been effected, but that a disastrous bitterness and distrust marked all their relations, we strongly insisted, with those whom we then believed to have influence in Abeokuta, that the Egbas should steadily and diligently strive, by adopting, to a certain extent, an armament superior to that of the Dahomans, and becoming proficient in their use of the weapons, to raise themselves to a military condition that should enable them, in the event of further Dahoman inroads, to effect the destruction of their bitter and relentless foes. We did not think it at all necessary that the great bulk of the people should have arms of precision, and know how to use them; but only that some two or three thousand of them should be armed with Sniders; and be made so fully to understand and to command the capabilities of the weapon, that it could not fail to beget in them a feeling of invincibility as regards the brave but undisciplined and ill-armed Dahomans. We fully believe that had the advice been followed, the end we had in view would have been attained. The effects produced by the employment of similar arms, even in the hands of native Africans, against the Ashantees during the late war fully confirm us in the belief that we were correct in that view. We repeat the advice we before gave. We feel a great interest in the Egbas. Although there has not been any such spread of Christianity among them as we had once hoped for—although education even has made little or no progress, and although we have been heavy sufferers by that disturbance of relations between them and the British authorities at Lagos which has led to so much loss of British\n**[JULY 1, 1875.]**', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""**April 6.**—In continuation of the account given of the Dahoman invasion, I have to bring a few facts and incidents together connected with it. Several European friends went to visit Ibara and the site of the Dahomey camp on the Tuesday. The impression conveyed to them was that the Dahomans were not so strong as they have been thought to be; one person supposed them to have been not above 10,000 fighting persons, men and women. The camp, seen from Abeokuta, was only a part arranged in three single lines, with a considerable space between the end of one line and the beginning of another, as if to make the best possible appearance, if seen from a distance. The camp behind Ibara was larger, in which the King was present, for whom a superior dwelling was erected, as seen by the remains. One of those who went to see the spot, remarked that they were evidently in great fear, for their huts are everywhere a good gunshot off from Ibara bush, as if afraid it would give cover to an enemy. It was reported in Abeokuta that of some prisoners they had taken one had escaped, stating that the Dahomans pierced their hands or arms just above the wrist, and passed a cord through the wound, to tie them, and ensure their not getting free. One of the gentlemen who visited the site was desirous of testing the truth of this statement. He examined the body of a man, and found on his arm a wound above the wrist as described. Another individual was anxious to know whether the bodies had been otherwise maimed, as described to him, and verified its truth by inspection. One of the native Christians reporting that he had seen many dead bodies, headless corpses, but that they were chiefly old men, was asked how he could tell they were old. He remarked that their scalps were there, and the hair was grey. The Dahomans seek to secure skulls, and after beheading a man have a process of cleaning it, as the skull is the only valuable part. Thus their own friends who fall in battle are beheaded, and their skulls taken home. Who can distinguish between the skull of friend or foe? Several reports are rife as to the doings of the Dahomans after leaving this place. The first was that they had attacked and destroyed Ishala, a town in league with them, but it was not true, and again, that the Okeodan people and others had attacked them on their way home; but this also we believe to have no foundation in truth. Whilst they were at Ibara they destroyed several small towns in its neighbourhood; those named are Illewo, Kesson, and Ijalle. As mentioned before, the Ibara people were attacked by the Abeokuta people. It appears they were going off or coming to Abeokuta, that some of the Abeokuta and Ijaye people heard of it, and thinking to get plunder, went to meet them. They endeavoured to plunder; the Ibara people remonstrated and resisted. A fight ensued, in which many on both sides fell, including the Chief of Ibara, and they were captured. As soon as the chiefs of Abeokuta heard of it they were filled with indignation at the conduct of their people, and have used every means since to give liberty to every one thus taken. Sentence of death was passed on the individual who shot the Chief of Ibara.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'What Caused the Heathen Uprising in Abeokuta on Sunday, Oct. 13, 1867', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In reading the correspondence between the two Governments, I find that the Administrator sent about five or six letters to the Bashorun, Akoda, Asah, Jaguna, &c., but that these were all returned unopened in consequence of their not being sent through the right and usual course (the Secretary); the Bashorun was therefore obliged to order that the churches and chapels in his town should be closed till Administrator Glover chooses to remove the constables off the Egba territories, as he could not see why the missionaries should be preaching in one part and Glover cunningly taking the other part, beginning from Ebute Meta. This happened on the morning of the above date; the churches and chapels were therefore closed, and the hundreds of war-boys (who were but too ready to go after the constables), suspecting both missionaries and merchants to be cognisant of the Administrator\'s proceedings, about twelve and four o\'clock of same day, fell upon missionaries, merchants, traders, and all those whom they thought connected with them, and destroyed almost everything belonging to them.\n\nThese are the true facts, Mr. Editor, and could bear the strictest test.

Now, Mr. ""Anxious Observer,"" this is either most deceptively-written or a base untruth told, as Administrator Glover must own that the constables were placed on the roads, and their dirty work going on, before the Egbas were asked to come to a definitive treaty with the Lagos Government.

Oh, that the true light would shine on those dark lands! Oh, that a nation should there be born in a day! This will, of course, follow the glorious second advent of the Great Messiah, the Crucified of Calvary, yet King of kings and Lord of lords; but we would fain have seen some small approach to it, some faint day-dawn glimmerings of it, in our own time. We hope for it even now, and hoping for, even as earnestly desiring it, our deep interest in the Egbas as a people is unimpaired. We do not regard it as a mere accident, that among the Africans delivered by British cruisers from the power of the foreign slave-trader, and subsequently introduced to the knowledge of the English language by education, and of Christianity by the teaching of zealous missionaries, the Akus should predominate in numbers; or that (so far as our knowledge on this point at present extends) they and the Eboes, their near neighbours in Western Africa, should have afforded superior evidence of the capability of the African to attain to and receive both secular and Christian enlightenment. We believe that God, in His providence, has so overruled events for special results; and shall not therefore be surprised to see some combined efforts, by these instruments thus specially prepared, for bringing such enlightenment to the native mind within the territories peopled by their race, as may prepare the way, among other things, to the adoption by the authorities of Abeokuta of those means of defence and security which the advanced civilization of Europe can and is ready to supply. The security of Abeokuta, its entire delivery from the cruel pest of Dahomey, ought to be an object near to the heart of all of them; and we often feel surprised that they have done so little hitherto, as a body, to bring their education, their enlightenment, their Christianity, to bear in an operatively beneficial way upon those of whom we have been writing. There are two objects that they ought to strive for, constantly and untiringly—and will so strive for, if their education and Christianity be worth anything—beyond those blessed individual influences on character and principle which ought to flow immediately from them. These two things are, the obtaining for Abeokuta, and the territory between it and Dahomey, that delivery and security without which nothing permanently beneficial can be hoped for; and the forming an easy and speedy land communication between Abeokuta and a point on the waters toward Lagos, to which the navigation is at all times open. These two things are intimately allied, for if such easy and rapid communication existed between Abeokuta and Lagos, it would be such an element of power to Abeokuta that the Dahomans would never thereafter think for a single moment of disturbing its industrial activity by their atrocious raids. We urge it as a duty upon all those who are connected with that country by ties of blood and birth, to employ combined as well as individual efforts for the accomplishment of this great end. Every one of those who have received the blessing of education ought to be an apostle of progress, and it will not be creditable to them should they still remain inert as regards great public objects, and only careful and enterprising in matters concerning their own personal advantage.', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1875#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**69**\n\n**FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**\n\nFor generations the existence and independence of the Kingdom of Dahomey has been a standing menace to the peace of West Africa.

Let this conviction sink deep into the heart and mind of every Christian and educated Aku, and create in him the principle of action. It is not for us to point out how this united Christianized influence is to be brought to bear upon Abeokuta. Africans ought best to understand how to deal with Africans, and certainly Akus best how to deal with Akus, to produce any desired result. It is only our duty to reiterate, that if the Christianity they profess be worth anything, they will burn with desire to effect what we have pointed out in Abeokuta. Let them reflect a moment. If British Christians had been satisfied with the mere possession of Christian benefits for themselves—satisfied with the personal and individual good Christianity had bestowed on them, and had not been moved with ardent desire that others should be made partakers of like precious benefits, what would now have been the mental and social condition of those who boast, in the British Settlements on the West Coast, of their education and Christianity? They would have been still under that degrading and debasing dominion of Satan which weighs so heavily for enfeeblement and ruin on their brethren of Abeokuta. They have been freed, emancipated, ennobled through the constraining influences of Christianity in British hearts. Let similar constraining influences impel them to united action in and upon Abeokuta. We do not ask them all to become Christian missionaries to their heathen brethren. What we ask is, that they should unite and actively labour to bring Christian influences to bear on Abeokuta. The little band of Christians under a Christian war chief, that was instrumental in hastening the late departure of the invading Dahomans, suggests a mode of efficacious action. Let them strive to augment that Christian band, and to perfect it in armament, until it shall become a power for the public good. The real home of the Akus is in the Egba and Yoruba countries, not in Sierra Leone and other sea-coast towns. If they have received the gift of educational and Christian enlightenment, they ought to feel that it was not for their mere personal benefit they have so received it, but also as a deposit, a trust, a means, a power for good to others. We call upon them, not in our own name and by our own impulse, but in the name of, and by impulse from Him to whom, if they be indeed Christians, they owe a hearty and active obedience—we call on them, in His name, to get out of their mere selves, out of their all-absorbing individuality. Selfishness is an ignoble principle of action. It may obtain some personal indulgences and gratifications for the man who is under its supreme influence, but these indulgences and gratifications will prove at last to be but as Dead Sea apples to his immortal soul. But let him once embrace and act upon the Godlike principle of doing good to others—let him set before himself some noble work to be undertaken, pursued, and accomplished for the good of others, and he will find a reward which only he who has undertaken such a work can comprehend or enjoy. It is the absence of noble aspirations in the young minds in Sierra Leone, that constitutes the danger to which a nascent civilization is there exposed. Selfishness, which leads to ignoble pursuits and demoralizing indulgences, is the rock on which that civilization is being wrecked. Will not a man—a true man—arise to preach and labour for the deliverance of Abeokuta; as Peter the Hermit preached and laboured to stir up the hearts of men in the Middle Ages throughout Europe, for the deliverance of the supposed Holy Sepulchre from the hands of the infidels? The object in that case, though seemingly noble, was an error, a delusion, and a snare. Such, however, could never be the object of an Aku, striving for the deliverance and ennoblement of the home of his race. It will be a glorious enterprise to stimulate a torpid nationality to life and vigour, to impel a people in the path that leads to empire, to deliver from death and ruin a people otherwise doomed to slaughter and destruction. How is it that the news of these annual Dahoman inroads into Egba territory, with all their attendant and consequent horrors and atrocities—the burning, the devastation, the plunder, the slaughter, the atrocious sacrifices of captives in the horrid customs of Dahomey; the degradation of a people, scared, cowed, crouching behind its city walls, in fear of the enemy—makes our European blood boil with a righteous indignation, and yet seems not to produce any effect on Africans, of the same race, nation, and blood? Is it not a disgrace to the educated and so-called Christian Akus that it should be so? It is a disgrace. Let them hasten to wipe it out. We look to them, that ere there can be a possibility of another Dahoman invasion of Egba territory, there shall be means of resistance there, and of punishment for the aggressor, that do not now exist.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language. The problems of nation-building posed by such a medley of peoples have not proved to be easily soluble.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims. As a result, closely related and sometimes previously politically united peoples at times found themselves on opposite sides of the agreed boundary lines.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > The map of Africa after partition and occupation', 'content': ""The new geopolitical map of Africa that evolved after about a generation of systematic boundary-making and military occupation was quite different from what it had been in 1879 (see Fig. 1.1). The European powers had partitioned the continent into some forty political units. The new boun¬ daries have been regarded by some scholars as unacceptable because they were deemed to be arbitrary, artificial, precipitate and haphazard and to have distorted the national pre-European political order. Others, such as Joseph Anene and Saadia Touval, have regarded them as making more sense than they did by 1879.63\nThere is some truth in both points of view. Some 30% of the total length of the borders were drawn as straight lines, and these and others often cut right across ethnic and linguistic boundaries. On the other hand, the remaining borders did follow national boundaries and cannot therefore be considered as arbitrary or as ill-considered as the criticisms would suggest. Moreover, African political units evolving as a result, for example, of the Oyo-Dahomey conflict, the Fulani djihâds, the Mfecane in Southern Africa, or the internal struggle for power in both Ethiopia and Uganda during the second half of the nineteenth century, testify to the fluidity of African boundaries, frontiers and enclaves prior to the partition. What is not often realized is the extent to which the partition solidified these fluid boundaries, or the extent of the efforts made by the boundary com› missioners to rectify anomalies, where politically possible, during the numerous boundary delimitations. On balance, then, although the map of Africa in 1914 (see Fig. 2.1), compared to what it was in 1879, may have looked very confusing, the delimitation had nevertheless been a remarkably efficient job, thanks to the new advances in cartography. And although the partition must be condemned as illegal and immoral, and it must be recognized that some of the boundaries were indeed artificial and arbitrary, it would be undesirable - indeed dangerous - to continue to advocate a return to the fluid, pre-European international boundaries except after a very close scrutiny - because of the 'mess' said to have been created by the partition."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'Finally, only those historians who are really ignorant of or hold very simplistic views about the political and ethno-cultural situation in Africa on the eve of the European partition and conquest would use that term.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other.

Contrary to general belief, such an approach is no ingenious discovery of the 'new' African historiography. J. S. Keltie's remarkable book, The Partition of Africa,$^{27}$ published in 1893, does note perceptively that the Scramble of the 1880s was the logical consequence of the nibbling at the continent which started some 300 years ago. It also gives a nodding acceptance to the view that the partition was economic› ally motivated although that is not its central argument. In the 1930s, George Hardy, the prolific French colonial historian, also demonstrated the local African dimensions of the partition, and he treated Africa very much as a historical unity. Like Keltie, he argues that although the immediate cause of partition was the economic rivalry of the countries of industrial Europe, it was at the same time an important phase in the longstanding contact between Europe and Africa. He suggests that African resistance to increasing European influence precipitated the actual conquest just as the increasing commercial rivalry of the industrialized nations led to the partition. 28 For a long time such views of the partition were ignored. But with the publication in 1956 of K. Onwuka Dike's classic Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta,$^{29}$ the African dimension of the partition was resurrected. Although Dike's book is limited in its time span and geographical range, it nevertheless encouraged a generation of historians to begin to treat the partition in the context of a long period of contact of different races and cultures. Unfortunately, while Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage demonstrate this extended relationship in their very popular Short History of Africa, 30 they still emphasize the European rather than the African dimension of the partition. It is therefore refreshing that A. G. Hopkins' important study,$^{31}$ although limited in its geographical scope, should attempt an African-oriented reinterpretation of imperialism in West Africa. His con› clusion is worth quoting: At one extreme it is possible to conceive of areas where the transition from the slave trade was made successfully, where incomes were main› tained, and where internal tensions were controlled. In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries.

In these cases an explanation of imperialism will need to place more weight on disintegrative forces on the African side of the frontier, though without neglecting external factors. 32 The present writer agrees with most of the views of members of this school.$^{33}$ Like them, he explains the partition in both African and European terms, and therefore sees the African dimension theory as supplementing the Eurocentric theories already discussed. He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

According to him, the decisive date for the shift towards an extra-European age - an age of imperialism - was 1878. From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

There is not much of the coast-line left unannexed; and the formation of the great Congo State has removed no inconsiderable portion of the interior out of the grasp of one or other of the civilised Powers who have lately developed such an unexpected taste for the formation of Colonies in Africa. The first partition of the Dark Continent was mainly caused through the entry of Germany into the list of colonising Powers; for until that time, Great Britain, France, and Portugal, though they held considerable tracts of country bordering upon the West and East Coasts, showed no tendency to enlarge their borders. And, indeed, the practical results of colonisation as thus carried out were not such as to warrant any great extension of European protection. But now we have changed all that.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TROUBLES IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Bastian, of Berlin, has received the following letter from Dr. Fischer, the German African explorer, dated from Kagei: ""The state of affairs at Uganda is very serious.

At present the hold of France over Madagascar is slender, but she is not likely to let go.\n\nIn 1876 Germany had no claim to a mile of land in Africa, though so long ago as 1866 Von der Decken urged the annexation of the region now included in British East Africa. The remarkable feature about German acquisitions in Africa is that they were virtually obtained within a few months in 1884-85; all else has been mere adjustment of boundaries. On the Gold Coast and in the Cameroons precise delimitations have to be carried out, and in the former region in the meantime Germany is creeping inland. The following may be taken as approximately the areas of the German claims in 1890:—\n\n**German Africa, 1890.**—Togoland, 7,720 square miles; Cameroons, 193,000; South-west Africa, 385,000; East Africa, 450,000; Total, 1,035,720 square miles.\n\nThe Congo Free State did not exist in 1876. Its limits were fixed at the time of the Berlin Congress, and embraced about 800,000 square miles. If the kingdom of Lunda, which has been turned into the Eastern Quango province, be included in the Free State, the total area will be about 1,000,000 square miles.\n\nAlthough an Italian firm had a station at Assab, on the Red Sea, about 1864, it was not till 1880 that it was taken possession of officially. Now Italy claims an area of 360,000 square miles. So far there has been no international arrangement, but there is not likely to be much difficulty in arranging boundaries. Abyssinia, Shoa, and Kaffa alone cover 805,000 square miles; Massowah and Assab, Harrar, and part of Somaliland cover the rest.\n\nTurkey's claim to Tripoli embraces 380,000 square miles. Nor does any one doubt that she is nominally the suzerain of Egypt; but, as a matter of fact, that country is held and administered by England. The total area still held by the Khedive is probably about 400,000 square miles, while the Egyptian Soudan covers about 1,000,000.\n\nComing to Great Britain's share in the scramble, and taking the limits prescribed by the Anglo-Portuguese arrangement, we find the following results:—"", 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PARTITION OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In concluding, he said that he had laid before them what had been done during the past 3,000 years by the various great Powers who had had dealings with Africa for its geography, commerce, and civilisation.

Until the Moslemised Arabs took it in hand there was no evidence that any enterprising peoples had crossed the Sahara, or, indeed, had ever gone beyond hail of the coast, except along the Nile Valley. It was only 460 years ago that Europe set herself to define the contour of the African coast. It was just about a century since Europe seriously set herself to the task of exploring the northern half of that continent and of discovering the course of the great River Niger. The Nile source was only reached some thirty-four years ago, and during the past thirty years more had been done to spread a knowledge of the continent than during the 3,800 years before.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

The lecture was illustrated by maps.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie began by remarking that during the past six years we had seen the bulk of a great continent parcelled out among a few great Powers. That continent was no new discovery. It was not a new world like America or Australia. It entered into the oldest traditions and the most ancient history. Long, indeed, before Greece entered the field, while yet Europe was the home of wandering barbarians, long even before Abraham left his father\'s fields, before the Phœnicians had settled themselves on the Syrian coast, one of the most wonderful civilisations on record had begun to work out its destiny on the banks of that Nile, the mystery of whose source, so long sought for, had been solved only within present memory. It was not the present business to discuss the origin or trace the history of Egypt. It was enough that the continent on which the oldest, or at least one of the oldest, civilisations was born and was developed through thousands of years, was even now less known than a continent discovered only 400 years ago, and had only during the last few years been taken seriously in hand by the peoples who had the making of the world\'s commerce and the world\'s history. It was only just 400 years since Columbus stumbled upon the New World, and yet what was in brief the history of America? It was now the home of 130,000,000 of people of European origin. It was, indeed, another Europe. The first British colonial settlement was planted in Australia little more than a century since, and it was only fifty years since that the continents there had had a free hand.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

They assume that all African countries, like many European countries, are inhabited by the same ethno-cultural group or nation, and therefore that any section of that group that allied with an invader could be termed a collaborator. But no African country or colony or empire was made up of any such single ethnic group. Each country or empire was populated by numerous ethno-cultural groups or nations who were as different from each other as, say, the Italians are from the Germans or the French. More› over, prior to the arrival of the European invaders, relations between these different groups were often hostile while some might even have been sub› jugated by others. To label such subjugated or hostile groups who chose to join the invading European group against their former foreign enemies or rulers as collaborators is to miss the point. Indeed, as will be demon› strated in some of the chapters of this volume, the nature of African reactions and responses to colonialism was determined not only by the ethno-cultural and political situation with which the Africans were con› fronted but also by the very nature of the socio-economic forces at work in the particular society at the time of the confrontation, and the nature of its political organization.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved. Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control. Towards the end of this period, however, the rise of Germany as a major Western power was beginning to increase the competition that already existed.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation.

British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans. We have already drawn attention to the penetration of the Benin kingdom from the Niger delta and the resultant whittling down of Benin's trading hinterland to the extent of the eventual abandonment of Ughoton, Benin's traditional port.

In the first instance they were particularly vulnerable to external pressures, as suggested by the willingness of the Afro-Portuguese and Chikunda to serve as Lisbon's imperial agents.

The same could be said about the relation› ships between the Nguni and their Khoisan neighbours. This is not, however, to suggest that conflicts did not exist between the two groups or, for that matter, between the various Nguni peoples. For instance, NguniKhoisan clashes were frequent, especially in the area between the Upper Kei and the Amathole to the north-west of the Transkei.$^{8}$ Conflicts were usually sparked off by the stock-raiding activities of the San, which pro› voked reprisal raids by the Nguni. It must be said, however, that such conflicts, whether between the Nguni and the Khoisan, or between Nguni chiefdoms, were usually fairly localized and controlled.\nThe so-called eastern frontier of the Cape was, however, a zone of blackwhite tension and often open conflict, and for this several factors were responsible. First, it must be borne in mind that for centuries Ngunispeaking communities had been slowly moving south-westwards from the Natal area. On the other hand white expansion in the opposite direction had been taking place since 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck founded a Dutch settlement at the Cape. The two movements were bound to clash somewhere. They clashed in what South African historiography used to refer to as 'Kaffir Wars'.\nSecondly, the Fish river, although recognized by the Cape government as the boundary, was often violated by the people whom it was meant to separate and keep apart. The colonists, especially cattle-farmers, violated it in search of grazing. The Africans, on the other hand, had never had any intention of recognizing, let alone respecting, this boundary, because when it was proclaimed by the Cape government many Xhosa communities had long been established along the Fish river and to the west of it. The frontier zone was regarded by many Xhosa as part of their ancestral lands of which they had been deprived by the ever-expanding Colony. For this reason, therefore, many Xhosa continued to graze and water their herds across the Fish and in defiance of the Cape government. Xhosa hunters also continued to hunt west of the Fish river."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Balance of power', 'content': ""F.

From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia.

Our builder does not know where he will get the required timber, except at great distances and nearly impossible transport to the place of building. I have proposed to him an iron roof to be covered with slate, to which he replies that he would immediately take to it, if he only could be sure that lightning would not harm the building. In this he is quite right. We have fearful thunderstorms on the mountains, and the large trees, acting as conductors, have nearly all disappeared. Now the question is, will not such a large quantity of iron attract the electric fluid, and act as a conductor to the destruction of the building? Will lightning rods do their work sufficiently to keep the building safe? Will not, if a thunderstorm come during a service, the danger increase that people might be struck? To decide these questions we should have something like statistics, which perhaps those could furnish who are constructing such buildings. Military engineers could, perhaps, give explanation.

Bristol captains who frequented that port were in the habit of supplying me with goods on credit, and as the credit system is general in our place, so I trusted also some of such supplies to people belonging to this town. These people became dilatory and afterwards unwilling to pay me for what I had given them on credit. As I must pay these captains, of course, I tried all means to come at payments, but it was fruitless. Being so pressed, I applied to the king of the place to enforce from the several debtors payments for me, which application the king readily complied with, but he was unsuccessful in obtaining any payments from the debtors for me. The king afterwards gave me permission to seize any oil which those debtors of mine might bring on the sea-coast for sale, till full payments were effected to me. On the strength of this I seized one of my debtor's, by name Ovorcoyrats, oil, which he had transported to the coast for sale. The oil amounted to eighty pots, about $160, which seizure was to be applied as part payment of what he owes me. Ovorcoyrats, therefore, was incited and instigated by all the educated traders, influential persons in that town, and those who cherished hatred against me, to do me harm; even the townspeople desired to kill me or to drive me out from the said place, but the king permitted them not to perform their evil intentions against me.\n\nA time after the seizure above-named, Ovorcoyrats took two women and three men belonging to my family captive and carried them away, and afterwards attempted at night to kill me in my own house, having collected in my yard upwards of 200 men, at the head of which he and his brother were. I caught him and his brother, and therefore the 200 men ran away and escaped.\n\nThe next morning all the educated traders from Accra, Addah, and one white man in particular, Ungar, of the Bremen factory, gave the men forty kegs of gunpowder, and the educated men armed their labourers, slaves, &c., to come in the night-time to attack me whilst I was peaceably at home asleep, and have me killed. Accordingly, one house of mine was set on fire by a certain Nar (trader) by name, and all the things I had in that house were plundered. During this plunder I escaped from my house, about which armed men were encircled, and reached the borders of the Volta, and was brought over on that side the river by a man by name Povoroo. An influential man from Jellicoffee, by name John Tay, sent messengers to me, desiring me to stop and remain on the Volta till he comes up to settle the palaver between me and the Addahs amicably.

Miller Bros\'. steamers plying on that river, and who is now on his way to England in the last steamer. He says, relating to the accident to the Sultan of Sockatoo, which caused her total loss, and unfortunately ten men also, ""We left Andony, one of the stations near to Ebo, about the 24th of May, in company with the Sultan on our downward passage for Brass River, the Sultan leading. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Sultan grounded off Egberi and remained all night. On the 26th got off, and proceeded on our downward passage. In the afternoon, the Sultan grounded again near to Emblama, one of seven hostile villages, and the King Omoru also grounded about a quarter of a mile ahead of her and about one hundred yards off the West African Company\'s S.S. Victoria, which was also aground. The next day the Sultan got off and anchored near us, but as we could not get off, she proceeded for Brass, intending to return and lighten us. However, we managed to get off early next morning, when Captain Wallace, the nominal master of the Sultan, made his appearance in a boat, and informed us of the Sultan having struck a snag near to the village of the Kéama, a hostile village on Sterling Island, and that they were obliged to beach her, as casks in the fore-hold were all afloat in seven feet of water. We proceeded at once and took what cargo out of her we could. She had a deck load of puncheons of palm oil. She was laying on the starboard bilge and heading up the river, and nearly parallel with the bank. The natives rendered us assistance in getting some twenty odd puncheons of oil landed on the shore, and the chief of the place, whose name, I believe, is Kiama, voluntarily came on board the King Omoru with two of his head men, and offered them as hostages as an earnest that no harm should be done to the Sultan or her men; but one of them taking alarm backed out, and the chief most generously stepped forward and took his place, and the three of them proceeded in the Omoru to Brass, leaving Capt. Wallace and the Sultan\'s crew to look after the sunken vessel. The King Omoru returned to the Sultan as soon as possible, when it was found that to keep the vessel from heeling over too far, Captain Wallace had, with the assistance of the natives, landed several puncheons of palm oil. In the meantime, the natives of Emblama—far more numerous than those of Kiama—had collected in great numbers, which could overpower those of Kiama and Ogberi, and sent a hostile message the evening before the arrival of the Omoru, threatening to come down to the Sultan, and anyone interfering with them should be killed. Mr. Hunter, it appears, instead of making any attempt to pacify those who were already come down—and which he might easily have done with a few trifling presents—immediately put the three hostages into irons, the chief amongst the rest, and ordered the Krooboys to go on shore with the two boats to take the oil off the beach by force, when, seeing the natives made some resistance, he (Hunter) fired at and killed one or two of the natives, which caused them immediately to open fire and rush out, cutting down all they encountered. The Kroomen took to the water, and some of them managed to reach the steamers; but I am sorry to say that there are seven of them missing, no doubt killed, besides Abouke, an Accra cook, and our Accra cooper. It was found that the rifles were of no use, there being no ammunition for the brass gun or Gatlin gun, so that I presume, under the circumstances, it was found best to retire. I have since heard that the Sultan was completely stripped of every thing valuable. The hostages were (my informant says) to be taken to Fernando Po, to be dealt with by the British Consul, Mr. Hunter going with them to prosecute, and Captain Wallace and Mr. Dunn, chief engineer of the Sultan, as prosecuting witnesses; but whilst lying off the Mission-house in the S.S. Whydah, two of the hostages managed to slip their irons during the night and jumped overboard, but whether they reached the shore or not it is impossible to say. However, the chief only was left, and was taken to Fernando Po, where there is no doubt Mr. Hunter will tell his own tale before the Consul, and his witnesses will scarcely be able to contradict any of his assertions; at least out here, being in his power, he is able to do them any amount of injury, holding such sway as he does. The poor chief who so generously gave himself as an hostage, and who has been grossly ill-treated on board since being made prisoner, will have all against him, for there will be none that understands his language to interpret for him, and even if there were, the poor fellow will be so frightened and confused that he will not know what to say or what is being said against him. It must be remarked that none of the vessels of the other firms get molested, either going up or down the Niger, even the little steam launches, only Captain Croft\'s ship, the Sultan of Sockatoo, ever since Croft and Stout fired upon the villages to test the range, I suppose, of their Gatlin guns.

A grand meeting of all the chiefs was therefore held; but at this meeting, strange to say, it was arranged that one Cojo Jeyowhy, who is cousin to Pedro Cudjoe, should be crowned. Pedro Cudjoe is against the Lawsons—who are English—so the arrangement to put his cousin on the stool produced universal dissatisfaction among the British residents, including the Lawsons. The latter then persistently refused to acknowledge Cojo Jeyowhy as king, much to the indignation of the other side. The German Captain seeing this, all at once, sent for 100 Marines and blue-jackets to enforce the claims of Cojo Jeyowhy. These were landed, and their presence was the signal for a series of outrages. They surrounded the English houses, killed an English resident, perpetrated certain outrages, and seized the Lawsons, including Mr. W. T. G. Lawson, and sent them on board their man-of-war as prisoners. The greatest consternation prevails. The Germans are seemingly bent on playing a big game at Little Popo. British ships and troops are expected to secure redress for the British residents. A few days later the German ship-of-war, Sophie, left Little Popo for Lagos for coal, with the Lawsons (including Mr. W. T. G. Lawson) on board, with a view, after coaling, of carrying these people on to Germany as political prisoners. Directly the vessel arrived in the roads of Lagos, Mr. Lawson very prudently managed to get the fact of his arrival made known to Mr. Griffiths, the Lieut.-Governor, who, as soon as he got the news, ordered his release, there and then taking care to remonstrate with the German naval officers for the rash step they had taken in daring to sail from neutral waters into waters which were British, with British subjects on board as prisoners, and giving orders simultaneously that, in case of non-compliance, twenty-four hours afterwards, he would certainly enforce his claims. A meeting was then called of all the German officers on board, and it was deemed advisable that the Lawsons, including Mr. W. T. G. Lawson, should be released on shore.'}, {'id': 4912, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN MADAGASCAR', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN MADAGASCAR', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_09_1884', 'content': 'With regard to the alleged outrage on the British flag at Bageida, at present there are so many conflicting accounts that it is difficult to arrive at the truth; the facts, so far as we learn, appear to be that in June last the Gold Coast authorities arranged with the native chiefs for the cession of the Beh territory to the Colony. In July a German gunboat appeared, with Dr. Nachtigal on board, who seems to imagine himself the holder of a roving commission to annex territory wherever he pleases along the African coast. Among the traders in the Beh country were a small number of Germans, who appear to have taken the proposed annexation in rather bad part; and, as soon as Dr. Nachtigal learnt this, he hastened to the British flag-staff and hauled the flag down, and then with a salute of cannon hoisted the German ensign in its place, at the same time proclaiming the Beh territory a German protectorate. Of course, if these facts be true, the British flag has, long ere this, been replaced. But there is no reason to make political capital out of such an incident, of which the grotesqueness more than counterbalances the insult. No doubt Dr. Nachtigal acted very rashly, and in ignorance of the true facts of the case; and we trust we have heard the last of it. It would be well, perhaps, for Germany to bear in mind, now that she has developed a desire for founding colonies, that nothing is likely to so prejudice her efforts in that direction as the adoption of a high-handed policy with regard to the colonies and trading stations of her European neighbours. Upon the West Coast of Africa, Great Britain, France, and Portugal have long established a footing; it depends upon Germany herself whether she will in the future, by her policy abroad, strengthen or weaken her position among the colonising nations of the world. Meanwhile, we have every wish for the success of her mission on the West Coast. England and Germany are too closely allied by affinity and commercial interest to allow such petty incidents as the one alluded to above to disturb their mutual good-will. And we are sure the day is still very far distant when the two great branches of the Teutonic race, who owe so much to each other, will fall to quarrelling over such small matters as the ""protection"" of a particular trading station on the African coast.'}, {'id': 5371, 'article_title': 'Massacres in East Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Massacres in East Africa', 'last_edit_date': '04-25-1886', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1886#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_05_1886', 'content': 'Cairo, April 25.\n\nNews has been received from Aden of the massacre, by the Emir of Harrar, of the members of an expedition sent out by the Geographical Society of Milan.

Barral and his wife, and a brother of the Sultan of Loitah, with nineteen well-armed Abyssinians, set out in search of water. At a short distance from the caravan they saw coming from the brushwood a number of native Assaimaras, who evidently meditated an attack. To intimidate them, M. Barral ordered his Abyssinians to fire a few shots into the air. They did so, and were reloading, when the natives attacked them with their lances. A struggle followed, in which the troop of M. Barral was entirely massacred. The main body of the caravan was next attacked. But the camel-drivers cut the belts binding the loads to the backs of the camels, and took flight towards Harrar.\n\nTwo days afterwards, another caravan came to the spot where the loads had been thrown down, and finding upwards of 2,000 muskets on the ground, and boxes broken open, they understood what had happened.

The proceedings on the part of the Germans was considered as very high-handed, as Old Calabar is a British protectorate, and the German vessel simply entered the river, landed an armed force, and without further ado took the King prisoner. King Eyo belongs to Creektown, Old Calabar, and the circumstances which led to his arrest are said to be as follows: Some trivial dispute taking place between two men belonging to the Bomboko and Rumby tribes, a gun accidentally went off, a woman belonging to the former tribe being killed. The Bombokos then made a descent on the town of the Rumbys, pillaging it. The inhabitants fled to New Wamaso. The Bomboko people then attacked New Wamaso, the inhabitants of which fled to the bush. Both the Rumby and Bomboko people are under German protection. There were two Old Calabar natives traders at New Wamaso, and the Bombokos made them pay redemption money and also carried off six of their servants. The Old Calabar traders for this blamed the New Wamaso people, and took seven of their people to Ikoneto, a town in the Old Calabar river, intending to keep them until their own people were returned to them. This was the circumstance which led to the visit of the German war-vessel to Old Calabar. A force was landed, and a messenger sent to King Eyo telling him that he was wanted by some white men. The King came down from Creek Town to confer with the white people. The German officer then told the King he must get the Rumby men at once, or he would be taken prisoner until they were released. He did not at once comply with the request, and was taken prisoner on board the gunboat. He was kept all night under arrest, and released next morning, when the Rumby men were restored. The two Calabar traders were also arrested and put on board the war-vessel, the Germans requiring a fine of two bullocks and three goats to be paid for their release. The King objected to this, but nevertheless sent the animals to Duke Town next day, when the gunboat had left the river with the traders on board. The affair caused considerable excitement on the river. The British Consul, Mr. E. H. Hewett, was absent at the time, but it was thought that the Germans would never be guilty of such a proceeding without first conferring with Her Majesty’s representative. It was said in the despatch that the natives in Old Calabar had too much confidence in the British protection to believe that such an action as that taken by the Germans would ever be allowed by England; but the strong-handed proceedings of the Germans in this instance and their equally peremptory action in taking Cameroons some time ago have led the natives to moderate their views of the importance of the English protection. Nothing was said of the restoration of the Old Calabar prisoners, so that it is believed that they are still in the hands of the Bombokos. The proceeding of the Germans was at first thought to savour very much of their action in the case of Malietoa, of Samoa, who strange to say is in exile in the adjacent river of Cameroons.'}, {'id': 5963, 'article_title': 'THE PORTUGUESE ON THE SHIRÉ RIVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE PORTUGUESE ON THE SHIRÉ RIVER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_04_1890', 'content': 'The following letter, which serves to throw some light upon the recent action of the Portuguese in Africa, has been sent to several of the London papers:—\n\nSir,—In view of the statements of Major Serpa Pinto, I think it right to hand you for publication the following extract from advices just received from our settlements in the Shiré highlands.

Páiva shook hands with them, and after a little said, \'I see you have the English flag up here. Can you show me a written permit from the Governor of the Shiré to have it flying?\' Mr. Wilson replied that it had been hoisted by the British Consul, and was \'on the ground of the English protectorate—no permit was necessary.

He again said, \'I respectfully request you to take the flag down,\' and after being refused again, said, \'Well, I proceed to do so.\' Mr. Wilson told him that he had might on his side; of course, he could not prevent him. He then hauled down the Red Ensign amid a salute of twenty-one guns and the \'Boo, boo, boo\' of his soldiers, and then in its place hoisted the Portuguese, amid another salute of twenty-one guns.

These arrangements, which are said to extend over the district between the Binue and the Songha, a tributary of the Congo, might block the way to Lake Chad, and consequently to the Hinterland of the Cameroons. The Vossische Zeitung remarks that Germany will always be able to reach Lake Chad from the south-west, if France still continues to look upon the east bank of the river Schari as the boundary of the French sphere of interest. There is reason to believe France will do this from her conduct in colonial matters towards Germany and her respect for the Berlin Agreement of 1885. Nor is it probable any hindrance will come from England, as the most easterly point in the British sphere of interest is Yola on the Binue, and the access to Lake Chad was last year assured to Germany by England. However, says the Vossische Zeitung, if England breaks her promise and attempts to cut off the Germans from Lake Chad, Germany can retaliate by raising claims on Sokoto, on the ground of commercial and friendly agreements formerly made by German travellers in that district.\n\nAt the general meeting of the German East Africa Co., held in Berlin, on June 14, the president stated that the Company was in a position to pay a dividend of 5 per cent. on the preference shares. This is the first pecuniary return yielded by German colonial enterprise.\n\nIn reference to the report from Zanzibar that Baron von Bülow, commander of the German station at Kilima-Njaro, had told the English missionaries to leave the Moschi district, as he was on the point of making an attack upon it, the Reichsanzeiger publishes the following official explanation: ""This information is so far in accordance with the news received here from German East Africa that Herr von Bülow was intending to attack the Moschi district and warned the English missionaries in time.

Five white farmers were charged with tying up natives and cruelly flogging them. Two of the natives were so badly injured that they had to be removed to hospital, and one of them died of blood poisoning resulting from his wounds. The defendants were indicted for culpable homicide in the one case, and assault in respect of the others; and the Solicitor-General, who prosecuted for the Crown, described the narrative as exhibiting ""a monotony of brutality.""\n\nFor the defence it was alleged that nothing more than a ""common assault"" had been committed, and only by one of the farmers, Mr. J. P. T. Hart. Mr. Hart himself gave evidence, in which he said that he had only used a ""reim,"" not a ""sjambok,"" in flogging the natives, who had been killing valuable sheep belonging to him. His anger at his losses had something to do with the severity of the punishment. The jury found the defendants guilty of ""common assault under great provocation,"" but acquitted them altogether on the other indictment.\n\nMr. Justice Jones, while admitting that there was some reason for the merciful view taken by the jury regarding the former charge, characterised the verdict of acquittal on the charge of homicide as ""a disgrace to the community."" For the assault, Hart was fined £125 or fifteen months\' imprisonment, and the other sentences varied from £45 to £100.\n\nThe Judge\'s comments are strongly endorsed by a portion of the colonial Press, and resented by another section. The *Cape Times* says the jury decided that killing was no murder. The effect of the trial on the native mind cannot fail to be mischievous and disquieting. They ""will see that they are liable to punishment without law, without proof of guilt, without fair inquiry of any sort, and that against such violence they are practically left without protection. The only remedy seems to be abandonment of trial by jury, and the establishment of a special Court, as on the diamond fields, or the adjudication of cases subject to the influence of racial prejudice."" The *Eastern Province Herald*, while agreeing that men must not take the law into their own hands, calls upon the Government to suppress the crime which led to the present case. ""Here is an owner of valuable stock losing them day by day, his own herds being in the conspiracy to rob him. He obtains from one of the boys a confession implicating several others, and he finds the skins of slaughtered sheep in the bush. He finds that sheep worth £30 apiece have been slaughtered for a beer-drink, and yet he can get no evidence which will hold water in a Court of law.

Before Prince John Ansah can be accused of forgery, Mr. Harris submits, the Government should ascertain from the King himself the correctness or otherwise of these statements.\n\nIn spite of the plausibility of Mr. Harris\'s statement, most persons will doubt whether it was not the intention, should occasion arise, to repudiate engagements and concessions certified in this way; though it is, of course, conceivable that ignorance of European customs led these envoys into innocently perpetrating what is nothing more nor less than forgery.'}, {'id': 6820, 'article_title': 'Leaders', 'full_section_title': 'Leaders', 'last_edit_date': '02-04-1897', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-12', 'issue_date': '04_02_1897', 'content': ""**THE TREACHEROUS CONDUCT** of the king of Benin towards a peaceful mission from the Niger Coast Protectorate has aroused a feeling of horror throughout the civilized world.

After a most difficult day we came at night to a large camp of the enemy at a place called Cross Roads. After an hour's fighting, in which three or four Hausas were hit, the place was captured.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them.

So far as Great Britain is concerned it would seem, happily, as if the difficulties were in a fair way towards a satisfactory solution. With the successful close of the military operations which have been found necessary in the Gambia, and the ready acceptance of the terms which were placed before the Jebus, we may hope that a more peaceful future lies before British intercourse, commercial and social, with the Natives, than has been the case during the past few years. But the Germans appear to have considerable trouble before them in the administration of the Cameroons. With the exception of Belgium, Germany stands in the position of being the youngest of the European nations as a Colonial Power. Ten years ago the German Colonial policy had no existence, and the great speed with which the resuscitated German Empire set about the task of founding and developing a Colonial Empire has not been without its visible drawbacks, in the lack of experience in government which has, both in the East and West of the Dark Continent, gone a long way towards damping their ardour in forming a vast Teutonic Empire in Africa. Even more difficult than the task before the Germans is that which confronts the French in West Africa. The existence of the uncivilised and independent kingdom of Dahomey has long been regarded as one of the great difficulties in the way of the peaceful development of the West Coast; and the conflict which has been forced upon the French Government is one which in some form or other was inevitable.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Though rather startling in its conclusions, it seems to bear the stamp of genuineness; and is interesting, as affording a possible explanation to other mysterious embroilments than this particular instance. The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago. And the French Ministry knows little more about it than the rest of the world. The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast. Personally they are not likely to win glory thereby; and for the State the consequences of such a contest are both painful and unprofitable. For the ascertainment of the source of this inglorious business attention must be directed to a very different quarter. Arms and commerce are proverbially at strife. Everyone sympathises with the trader's complaint of the confusion which warfare introduces into his affairs. He is the natural advocate and friend of peace, at least when his relations are with communities as advanced and well-regulated as his own.

M. Stanley draws an important deduction from the report of recent fighting between the forces of the Congo State and the slave-traders. First he calls to mind the provisions of Article X of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, which stated that Governments exercising rights of sovereignty in Africa should do their utmost to prevent the exit or entry of fire-arms by their inland frontiers, or their passage to regions where the slave-trade is rife. Next from his own knowledge he remarks upon ""the extravagant waste of ammunition in the slave-traders\' camps"" and then asks how it is that these same slave-traders, who ""for the last three years have been blazing away as though they possessed exhaustless supplies of gunpowder"" could still be so well provided with ammunition as to be able to keep up a heavy fire for several hours upon the Congo State forces. Putting two and two together, the conclusion at which he arrives is that one of the three Governments—Great Britain, Germany, and Portugal—must, in defiance of Article X., have been conniving at the importation of these fire-arms and this ammunition. If this be so, it is easy to see that the march of civilisation in the Dark Continent must be very seriously impeded. Every Government, in fact, can, by winking at the behaviour of its own subjects, very seriously interfere with the well-being of the territories of the other Governments. Unfortunately, it is easier to state the conclusion than to suggest the remedy. England may be able to answer for her subjects, though, considering the difficulties of African administration, it would not be surprising if sometimes she failed to keep all the sheep in check; at any rate, she cannot control the subjects of Germany and Portugal. It is much to be feared that so long as the slave-traders have the commodities wherewith to pay for arms and ammunition there will be found unscrupulous Europeans ready to smuggle them.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1893#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Congo Agreement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The recent agreement between England and the Free State excited in France a universal feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The fall of the Cabinet presided over by M. Casimir-Périer happening on the day this agreement was made known to the French public prevented this feeling finding expression in the French Parliament, as the members of the Chamber had before them nobody to question. The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy. If the Foreign Office wants to prevent so general an opposition from becoming acute it will aim at such an arrangement as may put an end to so dangerous an antagonism, and afford a gratification to the reasonable ambitions of both great nations, whose enormous colonial territories are indeed sufficient.”', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire.

He did not annex Zululand but split the kingdom into thirteen independent chiefdoms. Some of the new chiefs found it almost impossible to govern because of the resistance put up by many leading personalities of the pre-war period who were denied posi› tions in the new political dispensation.

The result was a civil war which raged well into the 1880s. 49 Meanwhile, none of the objectives for which the Zulu war had been fought were realized. It had been fought primarily as a prelude to in› corporating the African states into a federation, but the results went in opposite directions.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest.

But if there are difficulties ahead, it is well that the country should be prepared for them in good time. From the detailed accounts we have lately received of the defeat of Usibepu, the loyal Zulu chief, whose power had been established on the ruins of Cetewayo\'s, it appears that the position of the Reserve and of the British Resident is seriously threatened. The conquerors of Usibepu included not only the Usutus, the tribesmen who had been unshaken in their allegiance to Cetewayo, but a powerful body of Boers from the Transvaal. To the latter, it is said, was due the success of the attack on Usibepu\'s warriors, who, having repulsed the onslaught of their native enemies, were broken by the withering fire of the Dutch riflemen. The flight of Usibepu leaves the ground clear for the ambition of the Boer leaders, and brings the Usutus, intoxicated by victory, face to face with the British forces within the Reserve. It is evident that the former adherents of Cetewayo are, for the moment, merely tools of the adventurers from the Transvaal, who imagine that there is something to be gained by stirring up turmoil among the Zulus. The experiment is, perhaps, not as hopeful as its authors believe, for the Zulus, as South African history shows, are not tools that can always be handled with safety and success by the Boers. In order, however, to rid themselves of Usibepu, and to give a check to the British power, the Usutus are willing to become the close allies of the Transvaal Republic, or, at all events, of its more reckless and aggressive spirits. Dinizulu, the youthful son of Cetewayo, has been set up as a puppet sovereign by the Boers, who have promised him their protection and assistance, and to revive a forgotten treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with Cetewayo\'s father, Panda. The first-fruits of this confederacy are visible in the overthrow of Usibepu. The latter reckoned, apparently, upon English support, though without any well-defined claim, and the Boers will in all probability make use of his ""abandonment"" as a cogent argument addressed to the native mind in favour of the Dutch instead of the British connexion. The Boers, at the same time, if not possessed of much political knowledge, can hardly be ignorant of the serious aspects of an attack upon England, and having enough to occupy them immediately in the absorption of the territories of Usibepu and his adherents, they will hardly encourage their new allies to press their advantage so far as to threaten the Reserve. But the Usutus are savages, and, while ready enough to accept the assistance of the Boers in battle, they may not be equally willing to pay deference to the prudent counsels of their advisers. They have already declared, in menacing language, that they will not spare either the Reserve or Natal itself in their campaign of vengeance. Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, had been forced to retreat even before the recent victory of the Boers and Usutus over Usibepu, and has been standing for some time on the defensive. The Imperial forces in Natal and in the Reserve are, no doubt, strong enough to repel any partial and unorganized raid, but there is now, it is clear, a possibility, at least, of more serious perils, which is causing disquietude at Maritzburg and Durban.'}, {'id': 4882, 'article_title': 'GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MONTH.', 'full_section_title': 'GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MONTH.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-0', 'issue_date': '01_08_1884', 'content': ""The House of Lords having on the 7th thrown out the Franchise Bill, the country has been plunged into the throes of a grave constitutional crisis.

The Queen\'s Speech to ""my Lords"" and ""faithful Commons"" is remarkable, if for nothing else, at least for the prominence with which African affairs are therein treated. Called together ""after a recess unusually short,"" for the express purpose of giving further consideration to the great subject of the representation of the people, Parliament is advised, not as regards the position and prospects of the famous Franchise Bill, but as to the condition of British interests in one or other portion of the ""Dark Continent."" At least three-fourths of the Royal Message is devoted to explanatory references to General Gordon\'s defence of Khartoum; to the advance of an English force to his rescue; to the measures taken for securing better government in Egypt; to the overt action of the authorities in the Transvaal, and to the co-operation of the Cape Colony with the Home Government, in securing the faithful observance of the Convention. And the allusions, moreover, are capped by the statement—long since anticipated by the critics of the Government—that the operations in the Soudan will render further pecuniary provision necessary. When, last month, attention was drawn in these columns to the urgent manner in which African interests were forcing themselves upon public notice, it was scarcely expected that an official confirmation of our views would be so soon forthcoming. Too long the vast material advantages to be derived by this country from a proper cultivation of the opportunities offering in Africa for Commerce and colonization have been neglected. Now, however, that the Government seem at last to realise, if not wholly, yet in a measure, the importance of the grand possibilities possessed by the Continent for development in practically every direction, it behoves every true friend of Africa to encourage and strengthen this newly-awakened enthusiasm. Judged by the past alone, it would be difficult to give the powers that be much credit for the adoption in the future of any better or more enlightened policy in regard to our African possessions than they have pursued hitherto. But, happily for their prestige in the eyes of the nation—and, indeed, of the world at large—Lord Derby, though at the eleventh hour, has summoned up sufficient courage to peremptorily protest against the annexation, by the Boers, of Montsioa\'s territory. This prompt exhibition of British authority at once secured the desired object—the formal withdrawal of the claims and pretensions of the Transvaal Republic, an effect which those who have so long counselled the adoption of a more spirited policy towards our quasi-Dutch neighbours had confidently predicted. Indeed, President Kruger—speaking on behalf of the Volksraad—has even gone so far as to admit the right of the ""Governments acting in this matter to use their influence with the parties concerned, in order to obtain, amicably, an enduring peace."" Now, the only Governments ""acting in this matter"" are those of England and of the Cape Colony; while the Transvaal State is itself one of the ""parties concerned,"" with whom those Governments are expressly invited to ""use their influence."" Thus, events and circumstances have been kinder to the Ministry almost than they deserved, and if they now neglect this golden opportunity—if Lord Derby fails to follow up his verbal protest with active steps for restoring English prestige and influence, not only in Bechuanaland, but in Zululand, and in every other part of the country where the peace has been broken by the Boers, the last state of those portions of the British dominions will be worse than the first, and the fault will lie wholly and solely at the door of the present Government.'}, {'id': 4954, 'article_title': ""THE QUEEN'S SPEECH"", 'full_section_title': ""THE QUEEN'S SPEECH"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1884#article-14', 'issue_date': '01_11_1884', 'content': 'The following is the text of the Queen\'s Speech on the re-assembling of Parliament, for its Autumn Session.

Of all the complications and difficulties that threaten this portion of the Empire, perhaps the most serious are those connected with the Transvaal. While disclaiming any bellicose spirit, it would seem that nothing short of a renewal of hostilities between this country and the Boers will effect any satisfactory settlement of existing problems. It is rumoured that the Government intend concluding a new arrangement with the Transvaal Volksraad concerning the Bechuanas and Baralongs, by which the Boers will assume the protection and government of the native tribes to the north and north-east of them. This policy not only reflects upon our humanity, but upon the utter short-sightedness of the Government in commercial matters, for the result will practically be to close up to British and colonial traders the highway to the interior. As may be readily imagined, the sanction tacitly given by the British Government to the establishment of a Boer Protectorate over the Zulu nation, has led to any amount of ""tall"" talk and no little despotic acts on the part of our late foes. It would almost seem as though Mr. Gladstone\'s Government intended to relieve itself before long of all bother and responsibility connected with the Zulus, their country, and their affairs. It is scarcely necessary to add that many of the Boers have helped themselves pretty freely to large portions of the most fertile land in Zulu territory, and that, as a consequence, the value of farms has been considerably enhanced. Thanks to the firmness, promptitude, and forethought displayed by Sir John Brand in quelling the Baralong difficulty, no opportunity has been afforded the Basutos for a rising, and Colonel Clarke has been enabled to maintain order up to the present.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LACK OF POLICY IN ZULULAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As the opinion of one who speaks from a lengthened and intimate acquaintance with the condition and needs of Zululand, the following (a letter contributed to a contemporary by Mr. F. McKarness) will be read with interest: ""We have been and still are incurring heavy expense in Zululand, but we are not discharging our responsibilities. The two or three thousand British troops who have been stationed for months in Zululand have done little or nothing to restore peace to the country. Their presence has been of little profit to the Zulus, whom we have wronged, or to the colonists of Natal. It is the Boers of the Transvaal who have been the real gainers by our policy, gainers to the extent of nearly three millions of fertile acres of Zululand. To us, as the Reserve Territory becomes every day more crowded by Zulus flying from the misery of their own country, the burden of protecting it becomes heavier. But the Boer appropriation of the country thus denuded of its native owners becomes easier and more extensive. If the policy of our Government is persisted in, there is nothing to prevent them from handing over the whole country to Germany. The effect of this upon the inhabitants of South Africa is notorious. The Swazi King asks: \'What benefit shall we derive from a British Resident in the country? There has been a British Resident in the Zulu country ever since the war, and he has not prevented the Boers from taking the country.\' Mr. Merriman told Lord Derby that among Cape colonists \'nothing gives a worse impression of English policy and of English dealing in South Africa than their action towards the Zulu people.\' The Zulu question is a purely Imperial one. Even if the war of 1879 was partly due to the Natal colonists, the policy ever since has been directed exclusively from home, and in opposition to the authorities of Natal. Mr. Gladstone has said that the war was made originally to conciliate the Boers.

On February 14 Sir Henry wrote: ""After careful consideration of the altered circumstances of Zululand I fear that no arrangement short of the establishment in that country of either our rule or our authority will heal the existing divisions or even restore peace."" And on the 16th of the same month: ""There is reason to believe that the greater portion of the Zulu people will gladly accept our authority, and that notwithstanding the troubles that may at first attend its establishment, it will prove the most permanent arrangement and the one that will best secure their interests and welfare."" As long ago as November 20, 1883, Mr. Pretorius, the Sub-Commissioner in the Reserve, wrote: ""I fear that if matters in Zululand are permitted to take their own course much longer without any active interference, the Reserve will be drawn into the confusion."" On March 1 Lord Derby telegraphed to Sir H. Bulwer: ""If Reserve extended, what initial grant would be needed from Imperial funds?"" Sir Henry answered on the 8th, ""Six thousand for first year; later, possibly next year, territory self-supporting."" On the 10th Lord Derby asked by telegraph, ""Would Umnyamana acquiesce extension Reserve?"" The next day Sir Henry replied, ""Believe he will acquiesce."" Umnyamana, it should be said, is the leading spirit of the Usutus, the party of the late King Cetewayo. On the 31st Sir Henry writes: ""It is certain there can be no peace in the country across the Umhlatusi until some recognized authority is established in it."" On April 12, having before warned Lord Derby that owing to the inaction of the Government, Boers had been gradually occupying portions of Zululand, he writes: ""The present intention of the Usutus, so it is believed, is to attack Usibepu; and, according to native report, they have been promised aid in this purpose by certain Boers."" Usibepu is an independent chief, established by the British Government, in the north of Zululand. On May 2 Sir Henry telegraphed to Lord Derby: ""It is reported that 800 armed Boers are in conference at Hlobane, Zululand. With them is Dinizulu, whom they propose to make king in return for territorial cession. The object of the Boers for a long time has been to obtain the uppermost part of Zululand; they will thus eventually make themselves masters of the country, to the great loss of the Zulu people, who will pay heavily for this Usutu compact."" On the 4th he telegraphed: ""It is said that Boers will join in the Usutu attack on Usibepu. Usibepu well able to hold his own against the Usutu party, but not against this unjustifiable combination, and he will be destroyed, and Zululand, except the Reserve, will fall under Boer domination unless we interfere."" This prophecy has been fulfilled within the last few days, Usibepu having been defeated with great slaughter owing to a flank attack made upon him by hundreds of Boers. On May 8th Sir Henry telegraphed to Lord Derby as follows: ""Situation is very grave, and I would ask your lordship\'s instructions. If we allow Boers to interfere and make Dinizulu King, it will be a most serious blow to British power in South Africa. They will also become masters of Zululand, to the permanent loss of the Zulu people, and to the great injury of Natal, to which will resort refugees for whom there is no room and no future outlet. Native questions will be thereby gravely complicated. In the Reserve, also, we should probably have immediate Usutu contest. For the great interests at stake I submit that we should not leave question to solve itself, and that if action is to be taken, the longer delayed the more difficult it will be. Situation yet possible to save by proclaiming Zululand part of Her Majesty\'s dominions. . . . If the Government of the Transvaal Republic loyally keep the convention, the difficulty will be much lessened, and should Her Majesty\'s Government be willing to proclaim, I could, if necessary, endeavor to make some arrangements with the Boers now in Zululand.""', 'last_edit_date': '1884-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Throughout the month, news of the most disquieting nature has been received by wire from both Cape Town and Natal concerning armed disturbances in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Zululand.

That fighting has taken place on more than one occasion between rival chieftains in the above tribes, is, however, beyond doubt, and according to the latest intelligence telegraphed last week by the *Times'* correspondent at Durban, affairs in Zululand, at least, are in a very critical state. Among the various rumours current, one alleges that the Resident has been driven from his house by twenty of Cetewayo's wives, who threatened his life. It is stated that the King's party in the Inkankhla bush openly refuse to pay the hut tax. This is possibly mere swagger; but all the accounts concur in describing the menacing pretensions of the Usutus in the Reserve. After Cetewayo's body has been buried at Ulundi, the long-pending outbreak will probably take place. The Usutus are said to greatly outnumber Usibepu's followers, whose chances of success depend upon his generalship and luck. Dinizulu is said to have joined the Boers along the border, who are clearly inciting the Usutus in their present action. In Basutoland, Colonel Clarke has held a pitso in connexion with the quarrel between Joel and Jonathan. Lerothodi, the chief paramount's eldest son, insisted on Joel's compliance with the wishes of the Government. Both chiefs have since accepted the boundary awarded.

In some of the earliest numbers of this journal we gave account of the labours of the devoted French missionaries in Basutoland, and of the cheering results being gradually produced, by God's blessing on their labours.

Never, to our mind, were there more unjust aggressions than those upon the Transvaal Boers and the Basuto people, and we cannot acquit Her Majesty's present Government of blame for not having interfered, immediately on their accession to office, to undo the injustice that was perpetrated by order, or with the connivance, of their predecessors in power, whose conduct in the matter of the affairs of South Africa they had so properly and so emphatically condemned.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH INTERESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a large meeting of ladies and gentlemen at the Battersea Town Hall, convened by the South African Association, an address was given by the Hon.

It was thought that the Association was formed to support some particular enterprise, such as the Chartered Company. The association, however, was an absolutely independent body. Its aims and objects were to obtain the removal of the grievances of their fellow-countrymen in the Transvaal, and to uphold British supremacy in South Africa. If England did not look after her interests they had neighbours who would readily take advantage of her apathy. The great difficulty they had to contend with was the want of knowledge of the real facts of the case, and it was one of the objects of the association to remove that ignorance. He was sure that the voice of this country would support a Government which would not neglect British interests, and would assist their fellow countrymen who were doing such good work in South Africa.\n\nMr. Scott-Montagu, M.P., in his address, assisted by a series of capital limelight views, gave a minute description of the principal points of interest in a journey which he had taken from Capetown, through Rhodesia, into the Transvaal and on to Delagoa Bay, in the course of which he advocated a forward policy as the correct policy for the British Government in dealing with South African affairs. He looked to railways to remove a number of the difficulties, and he did not believe that anything was to be feared from the Orange Free State, which, he said, was averse to the retrograde policy of the Transvaal. He did not believe that President Kruger was so hostile to England as was thought, but rather that he was pushed on by a hostile council, headed by Dr. Leyds. If we did not go forward, he said, England would lose her proud position of being the richest and most powerful of nations. That there were grievances in the Transvaal was beyond doubt, and was shown by the fact that the Uitlanders paid 19-20ths of the taxation without representation. There were also educational difficulties, and it was to induce the Transvaal to alter that policy and to obtain redress for their fellow-countrymen that he asked them to support the South African Association. In conclusion, he moved: ""That this meeting hears with regret of the grievances of their fellow-countrymen in Johannesburg, and hopes that effective measures will be devised to secure their alteration.""\n\nThe resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting then closed.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-04-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_04_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The King of the Matabeles is not a person who is entitled to any great sympathy.

The Acting Commissioner at once despatched three columns to operate against the Natives. Fuller information from Blantyre, dated Oct. 25, informs us that a very serious attack had been made on the south-western portion of the British Central Africa Protectorate by the Angoni Zulus under Chikusi. The ruling chiefs of this tribe are related to the Matabele south of the Zambesi, and from time to time Matabele refugees have come to this district from across the Zambesi. By this means reports that the British were being worsted in the south by the Matabele spread to the Angoni, and Chikusi (whose territory lies partly within the British Protectorate and partly within the Portuguese sphere) seemed to think he could attack the British with some prospect of success. The slave raids of this chief were stopped a short time ago by the establishment of forts in the Upper Shire district, and as he thus lost much revenue by no longer being able to sell slaves to Arabs and Yaos he has of late been on very bad terms with the British. On Oct. 8, 600 of Chikusi’s warriors entered the Zambesi Industrial Mission station at Ntonda, on British territory, and, after demanding that the station and villages round should be ransomed they burnt villages and killed a number of people attached to the mission. On the same evening another band of 300 armed men occupied the mission station. Following on this, villages near Fort Liwonde on the Upper Shire were raided by Chikusi, and many people massacred.\n\nAs soon as the news reached Zamba, Mr. Sharpe, Acting Commissioner, took immediate measures for the defence of the protectorate. On Oct. 20 a column under Captain Stewart was despatched to the frontier, via Liwonde. Another force under Lieut. Alston, was sent via Fort Johnston, and Captain Manning and Sergeant-Major Devoy received orders to lead a third force of Sikhs from Central Angoniland. The three were to converge on Chikusi’s country. At the same time the Acting Commissioner sent information to the Portuguese at Tete asking them to co-operate with the British in dealing with such portions of Chikusi’s country as lay within their sphere. It was computed that Chikusi could put into the field 30,000 warriors, but only some 300 of these are armed with guns. In this case, however, it is not so much the guns that are dreaded as the rush of thousands of men armed with spears and knobkerries, and it is felt that the present enemy is only less formidable than the Arab confederation at the north end of Lake Nyassa was a year ago."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment.

At one extreme I have discussed Makana, the Xhosa prophet of the early nineteenth century. At the other extreme I have discussed the Zambezi rising of 1917 and its links with FRELIMO. But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control.

Perhaps the most radical reinterpretation is that of Samir Amin. Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'.

African societies obviously opposed this worsening of their situation, and Islam served as the basis for their resistance ...

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans.

This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

The movement attracted widespread support, but it was immediately suppressed, and more than 400 Pende and one European lost their lives in the process. 42 Other religious-political movements attracted even larger peasant followings, which may be partly due to the fact that the colonial authorities had imposed a strict ban on political organizations.

Often we do not have concrete information about those rebellions that are considered an established fact'. Since then, the job of 'discovering' resistances has gone on apace.

The period we shall deal with cannot be limited to a single theme. Contrary to the common belief, the history of the years 1800-80 is not a matter only or mainly of long-distance trade and links with the outside world (the economy of Central African communities at this period was still based more on production than on trade). Nor can the precolonial nineteenth century be regarded as an era of widespread violence, because of the slave trade, civil strife, etc.: the commonplace belief that Africa was racked by incessant 'tribal warfare' overlooks the basic fact that the bulk of the peoples in the area led peaceful lives as producers, steadily improving their farming methods, bettering their environment and exporting the produce of food-gathering. Finally, the history of the nineteenth century is not to be reduced to purely political history concerned with despotic kingdoms and states: if there is a political feature common to the Central African communities of the period around 1800, it is more likely to be the much disputed quest for equilibrium and accommodation between powers derived from different sources.\nAn historical account of nineteenth-century Central Africa must in fact satisfy several requirements. It must describe the ordinary life and aspirations of the societies in this enormous area at the time. This would bring out the continuity between the 1800s and the more distant past: the changes, although noticeable, were slow.\nAt the same time, the history of Central Africa in the nineteenth century is characterized by breaks with the past.

The impact of the world economic situation, or of some specific sectors of it, was making itself felt: in some areas it influenced social and political history, giving a noticeable impetus to trade and offering new opportunities for stockpiling, while in others it restricted the process.

While denouncing the fraudulent practices we, however, hazarded the opinion that the native trader did not really believe he was buying 30 yards and 2 gallons when thus receiving only 26 yards and 1½ gallons; that the difference in price must reveal this fact to him; and that it is the people of the interior alone who are deceived and suffer.

Two white priests of French nationality were established in the place, and it was with these that M. Viard abode. Previous to entering Abeokuta he had visited Porto Novo and Ilaro, at the latter of which he entered into negotiation with the authorities, as they thought, for the purposes of trade.

The Governor informed the messengers that it was agreeing to their country being placed under France, and purported to be signed by the chiefs of the place. The messengers told the Governor that none of the chiefs had signed the document at all, although they had given M. Viard permission to trade. Ilaro is tributary to Abeokuta, and the latter place was afterwards visited by M. Viard. A report afterwards reached Lagos about a treaty with Abeokuta which handed that country over to French protection. Being so important a trading centre with Lagos, the news of the treaty caused nothing short of consternation amongst the traders of that colony. Meetings were held, and two most influential deputations were sent up to Abeokuta. The authorities there denied all knowledge of a treaty, though it was admitted that M. Viard was given permission to trade. He wanted also to go further into the interior, to Oyo, but this the chiefs refused to grant. There are two parties in Abeokuta—the Ogbonis or civil party, and the Baloguns or war party; but the head of the former is very much influenced at the present time by the latter. The rulers of Abeokuta, when it was alleged they had made a treaty with M. Viard to place their country under France, were indignant. A meeting of the chiefs was held in the ""Ogboni House."" This house is only used when the most solemn subjects are to be discussed. The Ogbonis asked their head chief if he had made a treaty with the Frenchman. He denied it. M. Viard, it is said, promised to return to Abeokuta in September next, and the chiefs at the conclusion of the Ogboni House Conference told their head man that if he had made the treaty he would not be there to meet the Frenchman in September, meaning that he (the head man) would be put to death before that time. The second deputation had returned to Lagos before the despatch was sent off, but they could get no more reliable news about the supposed treaty. The affair caused very much excitement in Lagos, and the action of the Home Government was looked forward to with great interest. When M. Viard left Abeokuta the chief sent messengers to accompany him to the border of their country, but he took them to Porto Novo, but it was not known if he had permission.

F. Herbert, with passengers and mails from the West Coast of Africa and the Canary Islands, has recently arrived.\n\nThe Volta left Sierra Leone on July 29, a few days previous to which the trial of Captain Crawford, the British official, on a charge of murdering a native servant was concluded. The deceased, it seems, stole the sum of £87, and for this he was punished by being flogged. The punishment was administered by instalments, and it is alleged that salt was rubbed on the deceased's back where he had been flogged. It was alleged that the flogging was so severe that the servant died under it. Captain Crawford, who ordered the flogging, was then the head official in the district of Sulymah, where the flogging took place. The trial, which lasted about a fortnight, caused immense excitement at Freetown. The Hon. Samuel Lewis, native barrister, defended the prisoner. The prisoner was found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. It was the general opinion that the accused would have got off. Captain Crawford's health is said to be so bad that the twelve months' imprisonment in such an unhealthy place will probably cause his death.\n\nSeven native policemen were also charged with the death of the servant in conjunction with Captain Crawford; but as it was held that they were simply carrying out the orders of their commander, they were acquitted.\n\nFrom Lagos news was received of the destruction of Iperindo by the Ijeshas. The Ijeshas sent a powerful force, and after killing a number of the people, burnt down the town of Iperindo. No captures were made, as the natives of the destroyed town are of the same kin as the victors. Chief Oloya, of Iperindo, escaped, but the other inhabitants of the town were made to pay a heavy fine.\n\nThe two great war parties, the Ibadans and the Ilorins, of the interior, were according to latest accounts encamped against each other, but no hostilities had actually commenced. Each party was watching the other, but it was said that a peacemaker would be accepted, as they were about tired of the interminable wars that had taken place between them.\n\nThe King of Warsaw, a place near the Gold Coast, who was deported to Lagos by the British Government thirteen years ago, has returned to Accra, his term of exile having expired.""}]","[{'document_title': 'The Quarrel of the Ibadans and the Egbas', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A new correspondent, ""Eni Olorunfe,"" writes to correct the statements of our various correspondents which have appeared from month to month in the African Times, relative to the unhappy dispute and hostilities between Ibadan and Abeokuta.

We regret to believe that matters are as E.O. states; because, under such circumstances, it would appear difficult for the two peoples of themselves to arrive at such permanent settlement, as the material and social interests of both Egbas and Yorubas require.\n\nCommencing with the history of the drawing together of the 145 counties of the Egba into one township at Abeokuta, for mutual protection against the Yorubas, the Ife, and the Jjebus, who were perpetually warring against them, he traces the subsequent proceedings of the people of Ibadan up to the present time; endeavouring to prove, and we think proving, that there is a settled purpose in Ibadan to destroy Abeokuta and enslave the Egbas, if possible. He points to the complicity between Ibadan and Dahomey, the objects of which were happily defeated by the overwhelming repulse of the latter before Abeokuta; and regards the late efforts of Ibadan to form a road to Port Novo through the Egba farms, as evidence of persistence in the same policy. As regards fighting power we think he gives abundant evidence that the Egbas are quite equal to the Ibadans. What then? Is it to be a combat à la mort between the two peoples? Is not some mediatory action—neutral and friendly to both Egbas and Yorubas—possible, on the part of the British authorities at Lagos?

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letter from Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Yorubas and the Egbas in this place are all kings and princes of their countries.

The war that is now pending would have been settled had the two tribes here mutually remonstrated together, and discouraged it, instead of each tribe sending guns and powder to the interior, and with flattering words, such as ""We are here, and ready to spend all we have to see Abbeokuta or Ibadan destroyed.""

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

The natives are determined that the German Government shall derive no advantages from the port. They are paying up all the debts they owe to the white traders, but are doing no fresh business. The people on both sides of the river have joined together, and made common cause against the Government. They do not threaten, nor will they fight, but they will not work. Their houses as well as their plantations were all destroyed when the Germans bombarded the town, so that they have nothing to lose.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers.

Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes.

Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}]",True

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Southern Nigeria', 'content': ""While the Yoruba, by and large, chose the strategy of submission, the rulers of the kingdom of Benin and some of the rulers of the states of the Niger Delta chose that of confrontation.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started.

Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks.

Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white.

They would draw your attention to the fact that disturbances among the natives are likely to take place in the absence of Consul Hewitt. Some time since the chiefs of New Calabar demanded the withdrawal of one of their number, William Braid, from Bakana, where he had gone to obtain unfair control over certain markets. Consul Hewitt decided that he should be removed, but the illness of the Consul prevented the order being carried into effect, and it is feared that the chiefs named will take upon themselves personally to remove the offender, and so cause bloodshed and disturbance to trade. The African Committee are therefore of opinion that if Consul Hewitt is unable through illness to return speedily to his post, a delegate should be sent to perform his functions, and in the case named peace would be maintained by the due recognition by all parties of British authority. In addition, they would venture to say to your lordship that, in the absence of a British representative from those districts, the laws promulgated by the Order in Council dated March 26, 1885, cannot be administered, or treaty obligations be enforced.

The Accra Government should, therefore, anticipate Samory\'s possible action by getting the start of him if he is known to contemplate attacking Coomassie, and hoist the British flag in that country, and in other parts of Ashanti still subject to it.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

By the acquisition which was forced upon us in 1853 of the native territory south of the Island of St. Mary, known as British Combo, and which has since been settled by military pensioners and captured Africans, we have interposed a barrier between the colony and a warlike and troublesome race, and have thus not only diminished the chances of future collisions, but have done much to ensure the peaceful cultivation of a large and valuable tract of country. On the northern side of the river, although we have long been the nominal possessors of a considerable portion of the Barra country, we have never ventured to exercise over it the slightest jurisdiction, and it has now been largely built on by the Marabouts, fanatics with whom it would be impossible to interfere; all thought of obtaining any influence over a country which they inhabit must therefore be abandoned. There is, however, one Sonninkee town, Essow, situated within the ceded mile of Barra, and just opposite St. Mary's Island, which, at the intercession of Governor d'Arcy, was spared by Maba when he burnt all the Pagan towns in the neighbourhood. Conscious of their weakness, the chiefs and people have expressed to the Governor a desire to live under British rule, the simplest mode of effecting which would be by the cession of their country, but this is impracticable, from the fact that they are shareholders. There are also strong objections to their country being made a protectorate, in the sense in which this word is understood in England. It would, however, be a subject of much regret if this small, harmless, and useful community should thus be abandoned to destruction through the fear of our becoming involved in unnecessary responsibilities, and it is to be hoped that the local Government may, without risk to itself, find some means of extending to them the protection they seek. Such a step would further our obtaining that influence on the northern side of the river of which, as has been stated, we are reaping the benefits on the south.\n\nThe natives not being British subjects, with the exception of the few residing permanently in the colony, are not, of course, liable to direct taxation, but the principal part of the revenue being derived from an export duty on ground-nuts, the produce of their labour, they do contribute largely, though indirectly, their share of taxation.\n\nThe export of slaves has been unknown at the Gambia for many years.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position.

Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary.

Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

Towards this end they removed a substantial number of unco› operative 'traditional' rulers, thereby violating the religious and cultural sanctity of kingship. To reinforce their tenuous rule, they dispatched African police, drawn from the ranks of mercenaries and allies, to oversee the activities of 'colonial chiefs' and to intimidate the local population.

In the Congo, Africans were compelled to collect rubber and to work on the railways and in the mines, while in Mozambique a variety of multi-national concessionary companies were the principal beneficiaries of the forced labour. Other Mozambicans were exported to Southern Rhodesia, South Africa and Sao TomØ. In Sao TomØ, on the cocoa plantations, they were joined by thousands of Angolans.

But at least I have so far limited discussion to armed resistance to white invasion or to armed uprisings against colonial rule as it began to 'bite'; the chronological extensions arise from the uneven nature of white advance into Africa and from the still more uneven establish› ment of effective colonial control.

Amin argues that the really crucial West African resistances to Europe came in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and he dismisses the resist› ances of the Scramble period itself as the half-hearted, rearguard actions of an already compromised ruling class. In Amin's eyes what was essentially at stake in the confrontation between Africa and Europe was not formal political control but Europe's attempts at economic manipulation. The truly significant African resistance was directed against such economic manipu› lation.\nAmin argues that the trade across the Sahara had 'strengthened state centralization and stimulated progress'.

Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria.

In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out.

The colonial forces dug in, restructured or destroyed the known social and political institutions, and imposed their own structures over the various communities. It appeared that colonized Africans needed a new spiritual reinvigoration in order to stand up against colonialism in its many forms. This spiritual need was filled in two ways: first by the emergence of a new generation of African prophets, and secondly by the founding of African independent churches alongside the European Christian churches, with a view to providing 'a place to feel at home' for the many Africans who had accepted Christianity but found it intolerable to live under missionary patronage. 5\nAlthough not sufficiently covered in the existing historical writing, substantial initiative was displayed by those African prophets who arose and offered relief from the stresses which colonialism had introduced into the social fabric.

In about two hours 500 of these were consumed, as also the Mohammedan mosque and a small Christian place of worship. The poor people lost nearly all they possessed; two men, three females, and two children lost their lives, and some twelve injured were carried to the hospital. The small fire-engine belonging to Messrs. Banner Brothers was brought to the spot as speedily as possible, but the fire had already obtained the mastery among the crowded habitations. The fire commenced at two p.m. 6th September, and at four p.m. had burnt itself out. The sad condition of the poor houseless people was aggravated by a heavy rain which soon after commenced, and lasted throughout the night and the greater part of the following day. The losses have been serious for the people—furniture, wearing apparel, trade goods, all were destroyed, the flames having spread too rapidly to allow of many things being saved. It is hoped that the Local Government and the well-to-do merchants and traders will assist in mitigating the distress which this fire has produced.\n\nSimilar though smaller fires are but too frequent in Lagos. Our correspondent tells us that three years ago there were no less than six in that one year—seventy or eighty dwellings in one night. Last year there were also six, and this of the 6th September was the fourth of the present year.

Written apropos of frequent fires in Abeokuta, and of the want of some non-inflammable material for the roofs of the air and light-excluding native hut, the writer shows how slowly the system hitherto pursued works for material improvement, and the need of efforts in an industrial direction: ""It is quite a question whether skilled labour should not in good policy take the lead, and reading and writing follow after, if not in point of time, yet in point of importance."" And again: ""Religion would be best promoted in the end by making industrial pursuits the first aim (not before religion, but before head knowledge) in point of importance. It is difficult, as experience proves in the few efforts already made, to communicate hand knowledge, but where the welfare of a country is considered, difficulties should be less thought of."" The African-Aid Society and the African Times have never spoken out more strongly than this. Truth will make its way, in spite of prejudice and jealousy. The ""native who returned from the Brazils,"" and who was sent out to Abeokuta under the auspices of the African-Aid Society, gives a faint foreshadowing of the material advancement in Africa that will some day result from the return of the African race in America to the lands of their forefathers. Had not some of the missionary body in Abeokuta opposed the sending of such people from America by the African-Aid Society, many brick and tile makers, and other valuable artisans, might now have been established there. We are glad to see that a change is coming over the spirit of our friends in that place. America will soon have many choice workmen and agriculturists from among its emancipated slaves, ready to bring their industrial knowledge to the assistance of the land of their forefathers. There are representatives there of every African race on the West, and of many races on the East Coast. Meanwhile we must all, Government and people, do the best we can, wherever British authority is in any way acknowledged, to introduce into the country those improvements in means of intercommunication, in dwellings, in tillage, and in mechanical arts, that civilization in Europe and America has acquired, and by which alone civilization can progress.

The walls of their dwellings are rarely, if ever, whitewashed, and are often crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty. Most of the rooms are miserably small, dark, damp, and badly ventilated, especially those devoted to sleep. In their sleeping places the poorer classes, and many persons in better circumstances, keep all the dirty clothing not in wear either about their beds or hanging from the wall, scraps of food and putrid fish being strewed about or collected in corners. The lower rooms open into inner courts, where, in fine weather, the members of the several families meet, and where they often cook and eat their food. The houses of what may be termed the middling class are well furnished with European articles of cabinet furniture, with crockery, glass, and mirrors, while the walls are decorated with cheap prints. The wealthy native gentlemen (living in the seaboard towns) live in well-built houses, commodiously, and often elegantly, furnished; but few of them have fireplaces in the public rooms or bedrooms—a want which impairs health in a country exposed to heavy night-dews, and in some wet seasons to heavy falls of rain. The general custom on the Gold Coast is to burn charcoal in clay pots in the public rooms and bedrooms when the weather is damp or cold.

Men who are educated consider themselves too good for labour as agriculturists, and only a very few condescend to become carpenters or blacksmiths. To be a clerk or a trader is the one idea of the native who can read and write and has some knowledge of the first three rules of arithmetic. Those who remain Pagan, or rather who do not frequent the schools and chapels, and live according to old habits, have few wants, and those easily supplied. Six weeks' work in the year will supply corn ample for all their wants, whilst capaiva, bananas, and such like, once a plantation is established, continue to produce for years, and oil and peppers may be had for the trouble of collecting them. Tobacco grows in the country, but the people are usually too idle to cultivate it, and it constitutes the main portion of what they buy from the traders. The cloth to cover their nakedness, and beads, powder, guns, wire, &c., they can buy with a lucky find of gold, or by gathering the fruit of the oil palm to make oil, and bartering it. As a native can live luxuriously on 3d. a day, even if he has no plantation and no wife to cook for him, and for another 3d. he can get drink and tobacco, whilst his housing costs him nothing, and 1s. or 1s. 3d. a day is his usual wages, a man who works for a month or two months in the year can afford to be idle for the remainder. The Gold Coast could be one of the greatest of producing countries if only there were some people in its boundaries who would work. There is scarcely a yard of garden except what is called for by the actual necessities of the people, and plantations for the purpose of export do not exist. As one gets more among the natives who are free from the influences of the coast one looks for some improvement, but except that slavery still exists, and that therefore some people are forced to show a certain amount of industry, there is none to be found. To this lack of industry must be added another great blot on the condition of the country; that is the apathy of the Government with regard to public works, and specially with regard to the improvement of communications. The revenues are hoarded in the colonial chest, and necessary repairs to public buildings are begrudged, whilst any expenditure on improvements is unknown. The roads or tracks are under the supervision of the district commissioners, usually officers of the Houssa constabulary, and are made and cleared in a spasmodic manner by a species of forced labour, in which the greater portion of the work is done by those who receive least benefit. The improvement and construction of landing places, and the construction of a tramway for the transport of oil to a good place of shipment, have been spoken of for years, but the powers that be consider it is more advisable to have a good balance in the treasury than to spend a sixpence on the most needed improvements; and as for the Colonial Office, the general feeling there is that our African possessions are a nuisance, and that if we could get rid of them it would be a good job.

In this he is quite right. We have fearful thunderstorms on the mountains, and the large trees, acting as conductors, have nearly all disappeared. Now the question is, will not such a large quantity of iron attract the electric fluid, and act as a conductor to the destruction of the building? Will lightning rods do their work sufficiently to keep the building safe? Will not, if a thunderstorm come during a service, the danger increase that people might be struck? To decide these questions we should have something like statistics, which perhaps those could furnish who are constructing such buildings. Military engineers could, perhaps, give explanation.

The cities were surrounded by walls and ditches, a large proportion of the young men followed the business of war, and all able-bodied men were liable to be called upon to protect their homesteads. In spite of these drawbacks, Yorubaland was well and widely cultivated, thickly inhabited, and full of local commercial activity. The price of food prevailing throughout Yoruba would show how industrious were the people and how rich its soil. Maize in the grain sold in the public market place at 6d. per cwt., large yams at 3d. a dozen, sweet potatoes at 1½d. per cwt., beans at 1s. 6d. a cwt., and eggs at from ¾d. to 2d. a dozen, while the most expensive luxuries of beef and mutton were sold for less than 1d. a pound, goats from 2s. 6d. each, sheep from 7s. to 8s., fowls for 3s. a score, and the small cattle of the country from 30s. to £2 10s. each. For 40 cowries—four-fifths of a halfpenny—his wife were in the habit of receiving a good meal. The city of Ibadan was the capital of Yoruba, the London of Negroland. It was surrounded by 163 farming villages, and was estimated to have a population of 250,000, while within the walls of the city 120,000 people were gathered. Other considerable towns were found at distances of a day\'s journey from one another. The trails throughout the country were kept in order by the farmers and villagers. Yoruba held out good prospects of commercial development, for the natives were not only industrious agriculturists for the purpose of supplying their daily wants in food, but they were also a people whose standard of comfort led them to spend much labour in raising and preparing luxuries which could be more cheaply supplied to them from Europe. Backed by the authority of the leading men in the country, he was able by personal inspection to satisfy himself as to the stock of cloth owned by the people, and the quantity annually consumed. He found that, taking an average of rich and poor, an annual consumption of cotton, silk, grass, and mixture cloths existed amounted to not less than 30 yards for each male adult, 45 yards for each female adult, and 6 yards for each child. The Yorubas were a fully-clad race, who for fashion\'s sake were ashamed to appear in public unless gracefully draped with two or three ample cloths. The price of such goods varied from threepence to half-a-crown per yard. They were made of home grown materials, dyed with native dyes, and woven in narrow looms or frames out of yarn spun by hand. From careful calculation it appeared that 31,000,000 yards of cloth were annually consumed in Yoruba, of which 30,000,000 were of home manufacture. From this they would be able to realise the extent to which the people were engaged in the work of making their own garments. In Yoruba there was an immediate market for European goods worth half a million a year, and in return for those goods the people there had the will and the necessary amount of produce to put at least an equal value of trade into our hands. By opening up the rivers of navigable depth there was no doubt that the trade could at least be doubled. These natural waterways were unfortunately as completely choked by vegetation as the overland trade routes were blocked by a rank growth of middlemen. To the industrious and struggling Yorubas, an opening for their energies in the direction of commerce would be invaluable. The Government of this country had for some time been actively engaged in negotiating the opening of the trade routes to the interior by land and water without infringing upon the liberty of the tribes, who were much better left to manage their own affairs, and without using unwise or arbitrary measures. Could other tribes be persuaded, ""for a consideration,"" to relinquish their commercial blockade, which might or might not be quite within their legal rights, there was no doubt that they would be the first to profit by the access of prosperity which would follow. And the Yorubas would profit in no less a degree. Their warlike young men would find in trade an adventurous life well suited to their training, which at present unfitted them for more peaceful employment; a less limited supply of arms would restore the balance of power in the interior, and insure the safety of the coast, while the terrors of the slave trade would give way to a large extent to the more profitable occupations of commercial enterprise.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-07-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The mail steamer Loanda, of the British & African Steam Navigation Co., arrived at Liverpool on Sept. 27, having left Lagos on Aug. 30, at which date all was quiet in the Colony. A recent strike of the police force was caused by an endeavour being made to compel the police to perform fire brigade duty in addition to their ordinary avocation. Recently, on a fire occurring in the Hausa quarters, great difficulty was experienced in getting the engine out of the Custom House building, and in the interval no fewer than thirty-six houses were burned down. It was then decided to remove the fire engine to the public works, where it could be got at any moment. The authorities also considered that the police ought to perform the fire brigade duty, and for this they agreed to give them extra pay in the shape of overtime. The police objected to the overtime, and as the result refused to perform duty. There was no alternative but to get them arrested by the Hausas. After imprisoning the ringleaders, an arrangement was come to by which the police are to act as a reserve fire brigade. Fifteen men are detailed weekly for the duty, to be succeeded the following week by fifteen others. The fact, however, of the police objecting to obey orders gave the authorities the impression that they could not be relied upon, and on this account the desire for the return of the 300 Hausas sent down to the Gold Coast from Lagos was expressed.—The work of constructing the new railway was stopped when the Loanda passed. This was on account of the rains, but there had also been a number of deaths. It is said that the line is costing more than had been anticipated, and that the money voted for the construction was nearly exhausted, although not much more than one-tenth of the work had been completed. Mr. W. Shalford, M.Inst. C.E., consulting engineer to the Colonial Office for West African Railways, states with regard to the railway being constructed at Lagos: (1) The construction has never been stopped, but during the wet season the rate of construction has necessarily been below the average. (2) During the rainy season, also, there has been the usual increase of sickness, but no death has occurred on the railway staff during the last year and a-half. (3) So far from the line costing more than had been anticipated, it is now certain that the work already constructed has been carried out within the estimate. (4) About one-third of the authorised length has been so far completed that locomotives drawing construction trains are running over it.""

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country.

It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'Finally, only those historians who are really ignorant of or hold very simplistic views about the political and ethno-cultural situation in Africa on the eve of the European partition and conquest would use that term. They assume that all African countries, like many European countries, are inhabited by the same ethno-cultural group or nation, and therefore that any section of that group that allied with an invader could be termed a collaborator. But no African country or colony or empire was made up of any such single ethnic group. Each country or empire was populated by numerous ethno-cultural groups or nations who were as different from each other as, say, the Italians are from the Germans or the French. More› over, prior to the arrival of the European invaders, relations between these different groups were often hostile while some might even have been sub› jugated by others. To label such subjugated or hostile groups who chose to join the invading European group against their former foreign enemies or rulers as collaborators is to miss the point. Indeed, as will be demon› strated in some of the chapters of this volume, the nature of African reactions and responses to colonialism was determined not only by the ethno-cultural and political situation with which the Africans were con› fronted but also by the very nature of the socio-economic forces at work in the particular society at the time of the confrontation, and the nature of its political organization.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again various societies had had different levels of contact with Europeans or Arabs, the two external forces impinging on East Africa at this time.

The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

It was resisted in arms, and much of the support given to the great revolts of the early twentieth century which tried to redefine sovereignty came from men who hated forced labour. It was also resisted by desertion and strikes, by refusal to work underground, by compound riots.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914', 'content': 'Both Liberia and Ethiopia had enjoyed more or less amicable relations with the European powers up to 1879.

Contrary to general belief, such an approach is no ingenious discovery of the 'new' African historiography. J. S. Keltie's remarkable book, The Partition of Africa,$^{27}$ published in 1893, does note perceptively that the Scramble of the 1880s was the logical consequence of the nibbling at the continent which started some 300 years ago. It also gives a nodding acceptance to the view that the partition was economic› ally motivated although that is not its central argument. In the 1930s, George Hardy, the prolific French colonial historian, also demonstrated the local African dimensions of the partition, and he treated Africa very much as a historical unity. Like Keltie, he argues that although the immediate cause of partition was the economic rivalry of the countries of industrial Europe, it was at the same time an important phase in the longstanding contact between Europe and Africa. He suggests that African resistance to increasing European influence precipitated the actual conquest just as the increasing commercial rivalry of the industrialized nations led to the partition. 28 For a long time such views of the partition were ignored. But with the publication in 1956 of K. Onwuka Dike's classic Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta,$^{29}$ the African dimension of the partition was resurrected. Although Dike's book is limited in its time span and geographical range, it nevertheless encouraged a generation of historians to begin to treat the partition in the context of a long period of contact of different races and cultures. Unfortunately, while Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage demonstrate this extended relationship in their very popular Short History of Africa, 30 they still emphasize the European rather than the African dimension of the partition. It is therefore refreshing that A. G. Hopkins' important study,$^{31}$ although limited in its geographical scope, should attempt an African-oriented reinterpretation of imperialism in West Africa. His con› clusion is worth quoting: At one extreme it is possible to conceive of areas where the transition from the slave trade was made successfully, where incomes were main› tained, and where internal tensions were controlled. In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries. At the other extreme, it is possible to envisage cases where the indigenous rulers adopted reactionary attitudes, where"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples. In the case of the Aro, it was the widespread influence of a set of oracles, managed through a network of Aro colonies and local 'secret societies', that provided a judicial and economic basis of integration over a wide section of Igboland.

Societies organized according to descent may resolve internal con› flict without recourse to central authority if the power of segments at an appropriate level in the genealogical structure is in balance, and the history of these societies often exhibits this mechanism in operation. But history also demonstrates that segments may unite to face an outside threat, and that military exigency may even give rise to something resembling central authority. Sedentary or semi-sedentary people have often assimilated nonkin who migrated to their territory, and in these societies residence in the same territory may replace kinship as a principle of association. Even societies that are organized according to descent may have leaders or councils at various levels in the segmentary structure or distributed throughout it; wealthy men may attract followers who are not kin; or alliances may contradict or partially offset the notion of kinship as a determinant of allegiance.\nAnother similarity among Saharan people was hierarchical social struc- ture, a consequence of the power of warriors to concentrate wealth so as to reinforce their own position of dominance.

There is now a new phase in the episode of this war. Owoosookookoo, the General, or Field-Marshal, commanding the Ashantee army, has sent repeatedly to the Fantees, as well as the Government, that this expedition was undertaken for the express purpose of capturing Ajaman, King of Western Akim, formerly a captain of the King of Ashantee, but who had claimed protection from us, and had been comfortably located in Eastern Wassaw, and a woman who had imprudently taken the King's oath.

The regular troops marched on to that place. Here also a detachment of the Gold Coast Artillery and 2nd West India Regiment, under Captain Brownwell, G.C.A., had been despatched from Mankasin to aid the native troops, and before the arrival of the troops Captain Brownwell had made two important sorties. There were four medical officers attached to the troops, and one left at Anamaboe to receive the men who might be disabled by wounds in the field, or whose lives might be in danger from sickness. At the head of this department was Staff-Surgeon Crowe, who took with him all the appliances necessary for the comfort of the wounded. A small native force, under Archeny, King of Arkumfee, of about 5,000 men, left at Bobeecomah, was surrounded and attacked by the Ashantee army. The fighting commenced at 2 P.M., and lasted till 5, leaving the latter masters of the field. The Ashantees burnt down the town and took a number of prisoners. They retreated from the Regulars at the sound of the bugle, asserting as a cause that their master, the King, had instructed them not to fight with the Fantees or the white man. A report is afloat that, after this engagement, the King sent at three different times to recall the army, but Owoosookookoo refused to return. They have now retreated to Soedrue, Ajaman's capital.

On the 22nd February upwards of 400 of the New Calabar nation, with twelve war canoes, armed with cannon of various calibre, opened fire upon the Ecruka country, situated some sixty or seventy miles from the mouth of New Calabar River. This challenge to a pitched battle was not accepted, and King Amachree, not feeling inclined to invade the country, turned his attention to blockading the creeks, so as to intercept any of King Phibia\'s men who were returning from their fishing-stations. Unfortunately, he was in this manoeuvre too successful, as sixteen men and women fell into his hands. Two or three of this number were immediately murdered, cooked, and eaten in the canoes, in sight of the Ecruka tribe, who were afraid or unable to attempt rescue. The remaining prisoners were brought to Calabar on the 25th February, and there, after going through the rites and ceremonies usual on such occasions, were killed by hacking off their heads with hatchets. The bodies were then cut up into small portions and distributed to the different houses in the town to be cooked. In addition to the sixteen prisoners already mentioned, eight others were captured, who are supposed to be natives of Bonny, but as the Calabarites are not at war with the Bonny nation, the lives of these have for the present been spared. From the fact of their being captured while in the company of the Ecruka men, they were very naturally supposed to be in league with them. Moreover, one of the men took a solemn oath that the Bonny men were assisting the Ecrukas by lending canoes and supply them with ammunition. It now remains to be seen what Oko Jumbo and the other Bonny chiefs will say. If they deny all knowledge of the eight men, and can convince King Amachree that they are not his enemies, the palaver will be settled, and the men, of course, \'chopped\' (eaten).

Steps were being taken at Cape Coast Castle to send up a representative to the King; and meanwhile the British authorities, so far from countenancing the rebellion, had given orders for the arrest of the King and Queen of D'Jabin, and both of them were soon to be brought to trial.\n\nThe British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamship Roquelle, which has arrived at Liverpool, reports that the war amongst the natives in the Cameroons River is now over, and the survivors of the Dido town people have returned to their old territory.

Sun-inyun died, and Aho succeeded him. King Aho reigned many years in Gadomi, but was ultimately attacked by Agongoro, of Dahomey, conquered and driven to Kutonu, where he resided, and resisted the Dahomians for some time, until at last he was dislodged and fled to Peh or Ekpe; here he also again for some time withstood the attacks of the Dahomians, Ekpe being naturally fortified by swamps; eventually he was driven from here and took refuge in Ketenu, some of his people inhabiting Peh, Jeva, Chanvi, and Pogi.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

Large numbers of the factories up the river are closed, and the traders are sending their working staffs home.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

With the exception of Belgium, Germany stands in the position of being the youngest of the European nations as a Colonial Power. Ten years ago the German Colonial policy had no existence, and the great speed with which the resuscitated German Empire set about the task of founding and developing a Colonial Empire has not been without its visible drawbacks, in the lack of experience in government which has, both in the East and West of the Dark Continent, gone a long way towards damping their ardour in forming a vast Teutonic Empire in Africa.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country. His father did not die, but he was converted into a rock, which could still be seen. Even the English King can be shown the spot at Ile Ife from whence his ancestors went out.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

The Phoenicians treated the part of Africa which they colonised as the British would, as the foundation of trade and commerce. The Phoenicians were followed, about 650 B.C., by the Greeks, who founded their first African colony Cyrene, on the coast of Tripoli. Then came the Carthaginians. They and the Greeks carried on a busy commerce all along the Mediterranean coast, far down to the Atlantic coast, to the mouth of the Red Sea. These were followed by the Romans, who continued an active career on the African coast until the decay of the Roman Empire.\n\nMr. Scott Keltie showed how little was known of the interior of Africa up to 150 A.D. by Ptolemy\'s map being thrown on to the sheet in the darkened theatre. This map, which was filled up haphazard fashion, gathered up, the lecturer said, all the knowledge of the continent which had accumulated during this long period of commercial activity — a knowledge which amounted to very little beyond the coasts and the Nile Valley. The next important period dealt with was the period of Arab invasion and the spread of the tenets of Mohammedanism — namely, from the seventh to the fifteenth century. In the early part of the fifteenth century commenced the ""glorious"" period of Portuguese activity, which lasted for some sixty years, during which the contour of the coast of Africa was completely laid down. This began the real modern partition of Africa, and the lecturer dwelt upon the effect which could be traced to Portuguese occupation of African territory — that occupation being marked by ruin rather than by enterprise. He rapidly traced the occupation of points of territory by Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, Danish, and Germans, whose commerce was in ivory and slaves. He held that the opening up of the continent of Africa might be said to have begun with Bruce\'s travels in Abyssinia in the latter part of the eighteenth century. From that time until 1850 nearly the whole map of Africa became gradually filled up, and from 1850 down to the present day the southern half of the continent had received increasing attention at the hands of explorers until it also had had its main features laid down.

They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Some interesting particulars of affairs on the Congo have been lately published, showing that, with the development of commerce on the great river, slavery is fast dying out. Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'together ""under a rock,""*, by constructing, with their permission and co-operation, a modern road for them through a tract of country which slave-trade engendered wars so cruelly wasted and destroyed.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1879#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African Native Wars', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We shall return to this subject as soon as possible.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-11-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}]",True

Thus it was that, although unable to unify the territory completely, he set about organizing the government, administration and army. He succeeded after a fashion in consolidating his power and in holding the conquered regions together, in spite of his rivals' plots, and the discontent and, at times, open rebellion of the masses. At the same time, however, colonialist imperialism was growing in Europe, and France again sought to dominate Madagascar. The diplomatic efforts which Rainilaiarivony deployed in an endeavour to steer clear of this danger were unsuccessful and the two wars waged by France - from 1883 to 1885, and from 1894 to 1895 - terminated in the eviction of the prime minister and the dismantling of the royal govern¬ ment. Although they gained control ofAntananarivo, the French very soon encountered armed resistance in some of the rural areas of the Imerina and in its subject provinces. In the independent regions, they found them¬ selves having to contend with kings and military leaders who put up spirited opposition to them.

The attitude of Great Britain, which had been looked upon as a faithful ally, was a disappointment, and is said to have prompted the prime minister to speak, with disillusion, of 'pretending to quarrel, like the French and the British'."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country offering uncoordinated resistance to colonial conquest > Popular opposition in the regions subject to the royal authority', 'content': ""In some regions, the population's reaction to the French conquest stemmed from the influence wielded by the Menalamba. In 1896, in the Mampikony region in the north-west, Rainitavy, a former Merina governor, recruited a motley crew of Merina deserters and Sakalava herdsmen and replenished the Menalamba of Rabozaka with arms purchased in the region. The uprising he organized was the only Menalamba movement in which commercial considerations played a fundamental part: the aim was to take control of regional trade, of which the Indians and Creoles had a virtual monopoly, which is why they were attacked. In the nearby regions of the Imerina, the relations of the Menalamba leaders maintained with local kings and dignitaries were instrumental in the spread of some of their ideas. The Tanala Rainimangoro, for instance, declared that he had received orders from Antananarivo to drive out the French. 19 Elsewhere, such relations were non-existent. In the provinces that were most firmly controlled and hence most heavily exploited, the fall of Antananarivo in September 1895 was the signal for attacks on the Manamboninahitra, who were chiefly officer merchants, and on Merina immigrants and foreigners. In the eastern province, for example,$^{20}$ the revolt of the 'Vorimo', a clan living on the lower Mangoro, triggered off a series of uprisings which created a climate of insecurity in the region throughout 1896. In the first instance, these revolts were directed exclusively against the Merina oligarchy. Until October 1895, when the governor-general of the province, Rainandriamampandry, was recalled to Antananarivo, members of the Betsimisaraka tended to destroy the soldiers' rice fields, refused to feed the royal army, or else merely deserted. From December of the same year, they openly attacked military posts and took the initiative of mounting sorties or organized raids against Merina planta› tions. The insurgents spared the lives of foreigners because they mistakenly thought that the French had come to save them from their oppressors. However, the very harsh measures which detachments of the army of occupation took to put down the revolts came as a surprise to the Betsimisaraka and later inclined them to believe that the French were not so much their friends as the allies of the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country divided in the face of the imperialist threat > The situation on the eve of the first Franco-Merina war 3', 'content': ""All these endeavours would have disarmed people moved by a genuine desire to civilize Madagascar and to spread the Gospel there.

They took advantage of three pretexts to pressure the French government into embarking on military action in Madagascar in 1882.\nIn 1878, Jean Laborde - who had initially been a business partner of the leading dignitaries of the kingdom under Ranavalona I in the manufacture of arms and munitions and landed property, and who subsequently became French consul on the accession of Radama II - died in Antananarivo, leaving real estate which his nephews, Edouard Laborde and Campan, claimed without success. The demand for this inheritance emanating from Paris was founded on the treaty of 1868, which empowered French nationals to acquire landed property in Madagascar, while the refusal of the authorities in Antananarivo to countenance it rested on the law stipulating that land belonged exclusively to the sovereign. The 'Laborde inheritance' case posed a problem of land ownership that was of direct concern to the settlers and traders living on the island. The issue at stake was whether they were entitled to own the land they worked or could at least expect to obtain a long-term leasehold on it. 7\nIn April 1881, relations between France and Madagascar became even more acrimonious over the ToalØ affair. The ToalØ was a dhow whose owner - an Arab but a French subject - together with three other Muslim members of the crew, were murdered by the men of the Sakalava king, Bakary, in the bay of Marambitsy, an area outside the control of the Merina authorities. These people, who were gunrunners, had been verbally challenged and ordered to hand over their cargo; instead, they opened fire on the Sakalava, who fired back and killed them. The French claimed reparation from the Queen of Madagascar for this smuggling incident. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country offering uncoordinated resistance to colonial conquest > The resistance of the independent peoples', 'content': ""At the outset, the French thought that by capturing Antananarivo they had gained control over the entire island.

One by one and in haphazard order, these groups of insurgents clashed with the locally recruited infantrymen led by the French, who never had to contend with two opponents at the same time. On the contrary, they were free to strike whomever and wherever they wished. The bands of resisters were isolated from one another and were incapable of uniting in the face of the common enemy.

These different movements joined forces to recall and defend France's 'historic rights' over Madagascar. That claim, which had its roots in the memory of the annexation proclaimed under Louis XIV and of the fruitless attempts made in the eighteenth century to set up a prosperous France Orientale, based on the trading posts established in the eighteenth century and under the Restoration, was developed throughout the nineteenth century in a large number of written documents before being put to the French parliament officially in 1884. The RØunion lobby demanded the complete conquest of the island, so that the overflow of Reunion's Creole population could be settled there and the abundant resources which the British seemed likely to exploit could be reserved for their own use. French Catholic missionaries in Madagascar, for their part, were reduced to evangelizing the lower social classes since most of the noble families and the rich and powerful commoners had been converted to Protestantism. Consequently they demanded official support from France in their bid to overcome the competition of the Protestants, whom they portrayed as being a product of the innumerable 'underhand dealings' of the British. This 'perfidious Albion' theory found a favourable echo in certain business circles which, in an endeavour to conquer the Malagasy market at the expense of the British and Americans, sought to debar the latter by annexing the island rather than by reducing the prices of their own goods. Colonial propaganda appealed to people's chauvinistic sentiments and the belief in France's humanitarian and civilizing mission. In order to prime public opinion for the conquest, th*; 'Kingdom of Madagascar' was presented, in blatant bad faith, as being a 'barbarous state', headed by a 'foreign tribe' which had exalted 'tyranny as a system of government' and still engaged in the slave trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > Struggles to recover dignity', 'content': ""Having organized, with Ralaimongo and Ravoahangy, the 'PØtition des IndigŁnes de Madagascar', demanding French citizenship, the abolition of the indigØnat judicial regime and the application of the social and cultural benefits introduced under the Third Republic, Dussac arrived in Antananarivo in May 1929 to explain the petition's aims.

The events of 19 May 1929 represented both the culmination of the struggle for equality and the starting-point of the demands for independence. They also marked the beginning of authentic political militancy, in the shape of propaganda campaigns, the creation of political cells and parties, and the emergence of a broad-based and varied press. Ralaimongo, who had been exiled to Port Berge, encouraged the peasants to engage in the type of resistance practised by Gandhi in India. In 1931, he openly mooted the idea of independence in response to a speech by Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Colonies, which rejected the case for wholesale naturalization. In L'Opinion of 20 July 1934, Ravoahangy evoked 'the natural and inalienable right to form a free and independent nation'. From 1935 onwards, other newspapers that were openly nationalistic in outlook began to appear. Both Ny Fierenena malagasy ('The Malagasy Nation') and Ny Rariny ('Justice') constantly urged that Madagascar must become free. The movement was losing momentum, however. In fact, 'the business community had been hard-hit by the economic crisis and withdrew its support... Civil servants were afraid of compromising themselves and of losing their jobs. The Protestant ministers were embarrassed at the political turn taken by developments and retreated into their churches.

This state of things is not unfavourable to the Christians. The hereditary policy of the Hovas is \'Things as they have been;\' \'The wisdom of our ancestors cannot be surpassed.\' But so many innovations have turned out improvements and benefits, that the aim now seems to be to adopt what is good in the new, while retaining what they can of the old.

A more shameful story of arrogance and high-handed wrong-doing on the part of a first-rate European Power has been seldom given to the world. The first dispute, it seems, arose over the sale of land by the heirs of a former French Consul to a Roman Catholic priest. The Hova Government objected to the sale because the Consul in question, by Malagasy law, which prohibits the owning of land by foreigners, was only a life tenant. Moreover, the title-deeds which the Hova Government declare to have been forged, bore the signature of King Radama II., dated several months after that monarch\'s death. The French Consul attempted to explain this unpleasant fact away by different reckonings of the calendar, but the Hovas are able to prove that not a single document of Radama II.\'s reign bears the date of 1864 except the particular one in dispute. The second dispute arose over the death of four French sailors on the coast. These men were, from the Malagasy standpoint, nothing more nor less than smugglers, who were landing weapons of war and ammunition, contrary to treaty. A Malagasy chief endeavoured to stop this traffic, and was fired upon by the French smugglers, whereupon the fire was returned, with the result that four of the French were killed and the goods in question seized. In the end the Hova Government paid an indemnity under protest. The trumped-up claim of the French to a Protectorate over the North-west Coast rests upon an alleged transfer of power by a certain chief to the French; but, apart from the fact that this man, as a vassal, had no right to alienate lands, the treaty which he did sign only allowed the French to settle for agricultural and commercial purposes, and to keep some armed men ""for their own protection."" We regret to find that the tone of the French officials throughout the controversy is to the last degree insolent and provocative. They appear to have acted upon the principle that weak nations have no rights which France is bound to respect; and that every Frenchman who finds himself in the territory of such a nation has a right to whatever he pleases, no matter what may be the law of the country.

And in answer to the inquiry, there went up a shout of derision at the French demands. There was no doubt left that ""the heart of a people beat with one desire."" Then the national indignation broke through the desire for peace, and a torrent of eloquence rushed from the mouths of scores of orators. The ""love of peace that was full of wrongs and shames"" was over and done. But there was no wish for war. Only a determination to face that alternative, should France assail the independence of the Malagasy.\n\nWe British dwelling among this people believe that the British Government will not exercise every resource which diplomacy admits to attain a revision of an Anglo-French Convention.\n\nThe Europeans in the interior are pursuing their usual vocations; indeed, there is no need for a feeling of uneasiness.

Mauritius and Bourbon count ten newspapers which feed the French papers—i.e., about ten millions of readers hear nothing but bad reports about the Hovas. Even the *Merchants\' and Planters\' Gazette* of Mauritius, in its number for May 20, 1884, believes that it is telling the truth when it represents the English and Americans as ""gaining concessions of land which are relentlessly refused to France.""

When the Malagasy Ambassadors went to Europe, even their presence and influence could not withstand the current of false opinions about the Hova people. Then followed the Malagasy official *Gazette*, which now keeps us informed of the truth, but which is hated like a viper because it does publish the truth. The false structure built up by unprincipled agitators is beginning to totter. The idea of impoverishing the Hovas is absurd. Imerina is rich in cattle, its agricultural resources are unbounded; iron, copper, and lead are plentiful for making arms. Cotton is plentiful for weaving. Imerina could supply the London market with eggs and poultry without any appreciable diminution, and as long as the French leave a single creek open, they might just as well...\n\nas well give up blockading altogether, as far as the Hovas are concerned.

The natives will always prefer to work for the English and Americans, who are friendly with the Hovas, for the same wages, and no fear of punishment, than to work for the French under penalty of having their heads cut off. The Hovas have the most powerful weapon against the French as long as they hold Imerina; they have simply to call in foreign capital to start iron works, lead works, sheep-farming on the healthy hills of the interior, and leave the fever-stricken French Creoles with a gun in one hand and a spade in the other to linger out a jeopardised existence.

Those who know anything of Madagascar history know the unpronounceable name of Andrianampoinimerina, who held sway from 1787-1810, and who brought much of the island to be subject to the Hova tribe. He had a favourite sister, Rahety by name, and it was at one time thought that her descendants might ultimately obtain the crown; but she gave birth to twins, and had no other issue. For fear, then, that the descendants of these two children should dispute as to their rights to the crown they were both put aside. In course of time one of these lines became extinct. As the late Queen lay on her death bed, very early in the morning of her death, a young girl of about twenty years was awakened out of her sleep in a house about a mile from the palace and taken at once into the presence of the dying Queen, who there and then named her as her successor, and exhorted her in some parting words to trust in the same God as she had trusted in. This young girl, Rajáfindrahety by name, was great-grand-daughter of the Rahety above spoken of. She was well educated in the schools of the Quakers in this city, and latterly in that of the London Missionary Society, and was, I am told, most promising and intelligent. There is another curious thing connected with it. Some three or four years ago she was married to a nephew of the late Queen. Little over two months ago, on May 7, her husband died. If this had not taken place it may be safely said that the girl would never have been Queen. The present Prime Minister would never have suffered any one to be Queen to whom he could not have had access, whether by night or day, and there is no doubt that very soon, even if it has not, as some say, already taken place, he will become the husband of the present Queen, and, unless prevented by the French, become far more powerful than he has ever yet been. Indeed, this is even now evident. For the first time in the history of Madagascar there has been not only no bloodshed, but not even commotion of any kind. The new Queen, under the title of Ranavalona III., has been accepted by the nation as their Sovereign. There is, indeed, no doubt but that some would have preferred a King but as long as the present Prime Minister has power there is no chance of this.

Yet in 1879 this whole structure began to crumble, and by 1900 it had ceased to exist.' With the imposition of colonial rule, 'the characteristic link between Africans and Europeans was no longer that between trading partners ... The most immediate effect of colonial rule was its impact on African traders by the end of World War I the radical decline of the relative importance of the African, as well as of the Arab, trading class had become an accomplished fact.' 40 But in general recent historians have been unsympathetic to trader resist› ance.

Nancy Hafkin stresses the purely selfish interests of the resistant chiefs of northern Mozambique: 'In no sense', she concludes, 'was their resistance popular or progressive.' 41 The capacity of the great traders to resist, like that of the rulers of the secondary states, was undercut because they had generated too many African grievances. When the British Imperial East Africa Company wanted to break the power of Arab, Swahili and African traders it was able to build a new trade route inland from Malindi 'supported by stockades built by communities of slaves who had run away from their Arab masters on the coastal plantations'.$^{42}$ The 'important entrepreneurs' of the Lagos hinterland found it hard to offer effective resistance to the advance of the British because of the unrest of their 'large labour force consisting mainly of slaves and serfs'.$^{43}$ The conditions of international trade, which had brought about the rise of powerful African traders, had also ensured that their success would have to be brought at the price of much internal tension and resentment."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

Amin is here describing resistances which were directed against an African aristocracy, but which were also a response to French economic aggression.\nAs the nineteenth century developed, Amin goes on to argue, the French ceased to demand slaves and came to demand raw materials and agricultural produce instead. In Waalo they began to experiment with agricultural plantations but these failed because of 'the resistance of the village com› munities'. The French could not succeed in overcoming resistance to proletarianization until they had occupied the whole area and were able to use continuous force. But this colonial conquest came so late in the progression that resistance to it was not very effective. By this time Islam had ceased to be an ideology of resistance and had become the spiritual solace of the defeated aristocracy, who used it to discipline peasant culti› vators and to ensure that they produced whatever the French demanded from them. 39 If Amin argues that the really important resistances came before the Scramble, other historians employing the economic perspective seem to be arguing that the really important resistances to formal colonial rule came only in the twentieth century. Certainly there was plenty of economic resist› ance during the Scramble. In particular, the Europeans broke away from their old alliance with African traders and middlemen and used force to set up a monopoly of commerce. The result was fierce resistance on the part of African traders - whether it was led by chief Nana Olomu of Itsekiri in the Niger delta (Nigeria), whom A. G.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context.

From about 1890 concessionaires were given the whole produce of the land in vast areas of the Free State, while the system was supplemented by the creation of Leopold's Domaine PrivØ from 1892. Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed. Undoubtedly disease and famine followed the break-up of the village organization of labour and the flight of whole villages.$^{70}$ No one kept adequate population records See J.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""But even more important as a factor were the economic conditions of the inter-war period.

For the 'economic revolution' in West Africa not only introduced a mone› tary economy and expanded commerce, it also introduced certain social and economic values among African enterpreneurs and social classes, notably the lawyer-merchant class. Although the position of these classes, particularly the small traders, had begun to change with the development of the colonial economy in the 1890s, it was in reality the First World War and its attendant economic crises which had a more immediate and significant impact on their status. It had been already apparent during the stagnation of the 1880s and the 1890s that the growing sophistication of commerce, expansion of markets, and competition from extra-territorial firms meant that the African businessmen would either have to be more efficient, or play a secondary role in the colonial economy.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

This widespread commercial prosperity came to an end with the drop of rubber prices in 1899-1902. 'The problem was intensified after 1899 in Bailundu by the intrusion of European traders ... When rubber prices plummetted, both Portuguese merchants and a new wave of poor whites ... arrived to establish themselves in commerce.' In the opinion of the most recent study of the Bailundu war of 1902, resentment at this European trade aggression had a great deal to do with the massive popular uprising which broke out against the Portuguese. 44 But in general historians of resistance who work from the economic per› spective associate mass revolt not with resentment at the European attack on trade, but with the more slowly developing realization on the part of African populations that the whites were determined to obtain cheap labour. Many Africans might at first welcome the Europeans as protectors against over-demanding chiefs, or rapacious Swahili traders, or slave-masters. But they very soon discovered that European demands upon them were equally, if not more, intolerable.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy.

The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

At the same time, Natal had a large African population, many of them returnees from exile whence they had been driven during the Mfecane.\nThe initial difficulties facing the weak colonial administration in Natal concerned the government of the Africans. The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected.

All the Africans living in the reserves were placed under chiefs and headmen, and where the latter did not exist, new ones were created. African laws, except those concerning witchcraft, were permitted to operate. To finance his administration, Shepstone imposed a hut tax collectable in cash or cattle (which could be sold to the white farmers for cash). His administration was consistently attacked by the white settlers because, they argued, it made the Africans economically self-sufficient and therefore prevented them from becoming labourers on the farms and plantations. But Shepstone did not lock up the Africans in locations because he loved them. Rather, he clearly saw that coercive measures to produce labourers would only result in resistance, which the comparatively weak Natal colonial administration could not possibly cope with. The settlers who criticized him seem to have ignored the contribution of Africans to the profits of large landowners who subsisted on the rentals of over half the black population living as squatters on white farms, and to the colony's revenues in the form of the hut tax. In fact what Shepstone had done was to produce a cheap administration that afforded the white colonial society opportunities to exploit both the Africans and their natural resources in comparative peace and security. 12 The white society was mostly of British origin. After the drain by Boer emigration the white population increased steadily as a result of immigration by British subjects escaping from the social problems accompanying the economic crisis of 1847-51. Financed by speculators, some 5000 white settlers left Britain for Natal in this period. By 1870 the whites in Natal numbered 18000. The increase in the number of white settlers went hand in hand with constitutional changes. In 1856 Natal was made a separate colony and granted a Legislative Council. The franchise was made colour-blind, so that male British subjects owning at the minimum immovable property worth £50 or renting property worth £50 at an annual rate of £10 could vote.

Efforts to compel Africans to supply the necessary labour came to nothing, because of the poor working conditions and low wages offered by the planters. The Natal planters, assisted by their government, resorted to the importation of Indian labourers. The scheme was arranged in such a way that at the end of a ten-year period of working in Natal, the Indian labourer had the option of either returning to India with his passage paid or exchanging his passage fees for a land grant and remaining in Natal permanently. The first Indians arrived under that scheme in i860 and towards the end of the 1860s there were 6000 of them in Natal; many of these opted to remain in South Africa permanently.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone.

The Kafirs within the colony, now amounting to nearly 200,000, are drawn together in what are called Kafir locations. The Government in the earlier times of the colony sanctioned the authority of certain native chiefs over the Kafirs in these locations. In making over in perpetuity certain lands to the Kafirs, the Governor and the Colonial-office were prepared to apportion these lands to the several *tribes* which has been thus formed; giving, for example, when there are 5,000 males, 125,000 acres of land; and constituting the chief perpetual trustee of this property.\n\nAnything more fatal to the future peace and welfare of the colony could scarcely have been devised.

Several months ago some Kafirs, attracted to the ""Diamond-fields"" by the rush thither of many persons from all parts of South Africa, took occasion to supply themselves with rifles at the diggings. This proceeding coming to the ears of the Natal authorities, who have (and properly enough) forbidden the natives to have in their possession unregistered or concealed arms, an order was forthwith issued that the offending Kafirs should at once register their rifles. It appears that there was either a delay or a refusal to act on this order, and measures were taken to enforce compliance. Three young colonists lost their lives in attempting to arrest the Kafirs. Hereupon a large party of soldiers and colonists set out in pursuit of the offending natives, who fled across the mountains, leaving their wives, children, and cattle behind. Failing in their attempt to seize the males, the colonists made a wholesale sweep of all the female relatives and property of the fugitives, and, it would seem, with little discrimination as to whether they were taking the families of the innocent or the guilty. Not content with stealing from 8,000 to 9,000 head of cattle, and large numbers of sheep, goats, and horses, the Colonial authorities kidnapped (according to successive Reuter\'s telegrams) fifteen hundred of the helpless Kafir women, the wives, sisters, and children of the fugitives and others. And now comes the worst part of this disgraceful business. It is stated in the latest despatches that the wretched creatures thus torn away by wholesale from their homes, are to be ""distributed,"" and ""apprenticed out at a distance from their former homes."" ""Applications have been received for 5,000 of them, if procurable, from persons willing to employ them."" Now what does this mean? All who are acquainted with the relations of colonists and natives (especially as illustrated by the brutalities of the Queensland colonists towards their enslaved and kidnapped Polynesian islanders—slaves under the guise of ""apprenticeship"") will know well that this apportionment of Kafir women and children must naturally result in the grossest cruelties and abuses. These and other evils and crimes have as yet passed without protest from the mother country; especially as the immediate danger of a Kafir war has passed away. But the scandal is so serious—the disgrace, which such proceedings are calculated to cast on the British name, one of so dark a dye, that it is needful that the Parliament and people of Great Britain should insist upon full inquiry, and if these facts be established, emphatically express their abhorrence of such enormities, perpetrated by men assuming the name and character of Englishmen in Natal.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NATAL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The select committee of this last session made a report, which, whilst approving of land being at once set apart adequate for the natives, provided it was invested solely in the Lieutenant-Governor for the time being, as their supreme chief, condemned the Government scheme which contemplated some thirty chiefs to be joint trustees, and urged the granting of individual titles as soon as practicable, under suitable restrictions as regards their alienation.

It is stated that the King's party in the Inkankhla bush openly refuse to pay the hut tax. This is possibly mere swagger; but all the accounts concur in describing the menacing pretensions of the Usutus in the Reserve. After Cetewayo's body has been buried at Ulundi, the long-pending outbreak will probably take place. The Usutus are said to greatly outnumber Usibepu's followers, whose chances of success depend upon his generalship and luck. Dinizulu is said to have joined the Boers along the border, who are clearly inciting the Usutus in their present action. In Basutoland, Colonel Clarke has held a pitso in connexion with the quarrel between Joel and Jonathan. Lerothodi, the chief paramount's eldest son, insisted on Joel's compliance with the wishes of the Government. Both chiefs have since accepted the boundary awarded.

Half of such loss is caused by sheer embezzlement, the other half is divided between reckless trading and gross laziness, wherein a trader sits down at his port and wastes his time, neglects his trade, and merely cares to live an idle existence, eating up a large portion of the goods in his charge, spending on himself and friends. I had a Jollof man one time who in one month spent 100l., feasting and giving presents to, and enjoying himself with, the warriors at Bombally. I brought him down here, brought him before the police court, but he got off on a technical point. The only heavy loss I had from the natives was when a band of marauders from Binto attacked and set fire to some houses and stores I had, in 1879, at Ballingho, in Baddiboo. The place was in charge of three or four of my people; the marauders fired on them and drove them away, then looted and destroyed the place. Had I been there myself they would never have touched it. But a loss like this must be expected where civil war is raging. I have been trying to catch the leaders of this party; when I do the native law shall take its course. Last season I had trouble in two ports: first, at Cutchau. My trader there reported that the warriors bullied him to give them ""presents."" I went there and at once removed him to another port, and sent a message to Biram Ceasey, the Chief, that unless he punished these people I would do no more business at Cutchau, thus he loses a large yearly custom. Second, at Bombally, Goomba Gay, the Chief, went into my house and took a gun from my trader as a ""present."" I went then and inquired into the matter. I could not see Goomba as he had gone up country. However, I had the means of repaying him: up to the present that gun has cost him 15l. It is quite true that the increase of customs duties and ""presents"" at various ports is beyond all reason, and the trade suffers from it; but then all such expenses are credited to the account of the traders, so they do not suffer. The only other time I was troubled by natives was in 1878, at Bondalli, when the Jolahs set on me and tried to kill me, I being unarmed at the time.

Because there alone in Africa we have absolute power over it; because there alone in Africa we are responsible for it; because there alone in Africa it is a reproach to this Christian nation—a reproach that we hope it will not consent any longer to endure. We have shown what Natal is—that it is the colony of a Christian nation, possessing a Christian population of upwards of 15,000 souls—a colony into which Christian emigrants from Great Britain are entering in a continuous, though not very copious stream—a colony into which a refugee Kafir population now numbering 180,000 has been admitted—a colony in which, notwithstanding the presence of this numerous African people, Coolies are obliged to be imported from India to perform the necessary work of the plantations. It is among those Kafirs that polygamy, as an institution belonging to them before they came into the colony, has been not only tolerated, but protected in the colony, to its manifest prejudice and loss, both in a material and moral point of view. For polygamy among those Kafirs, as in all parts of native Africa, is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. We have been told of late by some of our hasty African travellers, in excuse of the slave-trade, that a great number of the victims carried from Africa in the loathsome slave ships are criminals; and we have heard a sort of lament that where the slave-trade has happily been suppressed, the virtuous communities in question, as at Brass, Bonny, Calabar, &c., have no way of getting rid of their criminals. Well, these so-called criminals are so, if so at all, mostly through the operation of polygamy. The chiefs and head men monopolise all the women—they make of them their wives and slaves—and the lower classes of the population and male slaves are left unprovided with wives. This leads to aggressions on their part upon the coveted live property of their superiors, which becomes particeps criminis. It would be difficult to convey to our readers any adequate idea of the enormous evils resulting from that abominable institution of polygamy. In Dahomey, for example, where the sovereign power is absolute, every female child born in the country, or captured in the predatory expeditions, is the property of the king. Every man in the realm, from the highest to the lowest, receives his wife from the king, either as a gift or by purchase. No man can thus obtain a wife until he has become possessor of a certain sum, which being brought to court during the Customs, he receives a wife of some sort in exchange. In order to prevent the too great multiplication of criminals, which could not fail otherwise to take place, where the bulk of the population are precluded from the possession of wives, a number of women are set aside arbitrarily by the king as the common property of the people at large, upon very easy conditions for the latter. Ashantee is as Dahomey in this abomination. And everywhere else in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. All the hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who loathed some old polygamist for whom they were destined, and dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent. We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trustee of these lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change. We look, therefore, to Parliament to bring the power of Christian public opinion to bear upon Her Majesty's Government in this matter, and to insist upon a limitation of polygamy in the colony of Natal."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NATAL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our notice of the current affairs of this interesting and important colony must necessarily be very brief this month, as we have devoted a portion of our space to a subject that affects the most vital and permanent interests of Natal.

J. Mann, ""On the Physical Geography of Natal,"" the author exhibited numerous diagrams and maps in illustration of his subject, which was to show how the peculiar climate and fertility of Natal depended upon its physical configuration. The colony was a portion of the narrow, bevelled rim of the African continent, whose vast interior is an elevated table-land, with its coasts presented to the moist winds of the Indian Ocean, and its interior frontier formed by the Drakenberg mountain ledge 7,000 to 9,000 feet high. From the salient point of the angular line of the Drakenberg a mountain ridge projects into the middle of the colony, forming a high central backbone, from which short lateral spurs jut out. Each deep valley has its stream, and no less than fifty separate rivers find their way to the coast. There is a general slope upwards from the sea towards the interior, the gradient for the first seventy miles being 1 in 70. Up this slope the sea breezes, impelled by the eastern trade-wind, blow almost continually, but most strongly in the summer, owing to the power of the sun on the land, and it is in this season that most rain falls, the moisture-laden air, on reaching the rising land, being no longer able to retain its humidity, and therefore discharging it in almost daily showers. During the winter, on the other hand, when the monsoon agency is at its least, there is almost perpetual sunshine, and the weather is dry. The summer rainfall, as the author had ascertained during eight years\' observation, is about 24 inches; the winter rainfall only 6 inches. The temperature in summer commonly rises to 85 deg. at midday, rarely to 97 deg., and at night very seldom descends to 52 deg. In winter it rises to between 70 deg. and 80 deg., and rarely descends to 40 deg. There were five slight frosts in the eight years. The result of this peculiar climate, dependent on the geographical position and configuration of the land, is that sugar, coffee, arrowroot, pineapples, bananas, and oranges can be grown on the coast, while wheat, potatoes, and other good crops, cattle, horses, and sheep thrive on the uplands, the whole colony being only equal in area to one-third of England.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Occasionally African producers defended their interests collectively through hold-ups (refusals to deliver produce to market).

Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'. He fed, clothed and met social obligations of members; he determined the size of land and the type of crops to be cultivated each year; how much time to spend on the collective household farm (gandu; plur., gandaye), and how much on"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cross river basin', 'content': 'The external agents of change represented by the European traders, consuls, and missionaries exercised greater influence in Calabar.

They tried to exercise some influence through the trusts or credits they gave to Efik traders; and sometimes used economic sanctions by collectively suspending trade with any defaulting Efik merchant. But when, in the nineteenth century, the Efik began to quarrel among themselves, the traders came in as arbitrators and kingmakers.\nMissionaries of the Church of Scotland Mission reached Calabar in 1846. They formed a little self-governing colony of five to six white missionaries, teachers, staff, and converts, at Duke Town and Creek Town. The mission station served as a sanctuary for refugees from the community. But the missionaries also watched the local scene, and reported develop› ments to the British consul, or tried to exercise moral influence and to intervene in other ways.\nSince the Cross river estuary was so accessible to the British Preventive Naval Squadron at Fernando Po, it was comparatively easy to stop the slave trade at Calabar.

To the extent that particular classes or strata successfully made this transition, they merely perpetuated or extended their dependent position in a world economy over which they had no control."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler. Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The Igbo hinterland', 'content': 'The predominantly disruptive character of the slave trade may be shown in different ways. First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

In spite of the efforts of the missionaries and the Consul to abolish the cruelties and barbarous practices of the natives there, there are still many of the old customs in vogue. While the Gaboon was in the river, a petty chief, named Bokko, punished one of his slaves by chaining him to a post and brutally cutting off both his ears. The unfortunate slave, after two or three days\' exposure to the sun, with nothing to eat or drink, expired, and was found dead by some of the natives, a pool of blood marking the place of his murder. Bokko was at once arrested by King Adam Archibong, and after several days\' confinement was fined sixty boxes of brass rods, a fine equal to 120£. of English money. It appeared that the man had misconducted himself with one of Bokko\'s wives. The trial created quite a sensation in Duke Town, all the Europeans being invited to attend by the King, who explained, through his interpreter, his determination to abolish the cruel practices so long the fashion there. The public coronation of the King by the British Consul, which took place some little time ago, gives him a greater power among the people, and being a man of kind and humane disposition, it is confidently expected that an end will now be put to the ""customs"" of the natives.\n\nKing George of Bonny arrived at Bonny per the steamer Ethiopia, and had notified his intention of demanding ""komey"" (commission) on the exports of the river from all chiefs of the town, but as he had not sufficient power to enforce his orders, it was generally supposed that his demands would not be attended to. Advices from Lagos report the town as much more healthy, and the sickness which had proved so fatal to many had quite disappeared. Trade, of course, had not yet assumed its former proportions; but this was mainly owing to continued disputes between the Egbas and the Ibadans, in consequence of which the roads to the interior markets were still closed. An amicable arrangement was, however, shortly anticipated. Owing to heavy rains, and consequently ""bad bars,"" the depth of water on the bar itself was considerably lessened, and a survey was being held by the pilots of the port.\n\nFrom Whydah it was reported on trustworthy authority that Europeans were forbidden by the King of Dahomey to leave without his sanction, and that trade with one of the largest firms there was stopped, in consequence of a native of Dahomey having been put in prison at Quittah for debt.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Official Correspondence on the Affairs of Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'COPY OF LETTER TO THE EARL OF KIMBERLY ON LAGOS AFFAIRS.**\n\n_African Times Office, 121, Fleet-street, Dec. 16, 1871._\n\nMy Lord,—I deeply regret that the contents of letters I have received during the present month, and especially by the Roquelle, to hand this day, should have been such as to place me under the necessity of addressing your lordship on the subject of the state of affairs in Lagos.\n\nAll my correspondents in Lagos, even those who have been among the most staunch supporters of the present Administrator, are unanimous in representing the anxiety and apprehension that exist there at present, caused by a seeming tendency on the part of the Executive to foment troubles in the interior countries, and interfere unjustifiably and dangerously with contiguous territories and peoples.\n\nOn the 11th of September last, the Administrator caused the Legislative Council to pass through all its three stages ""An Ordinance to authorise the Administrator to prohibit the export of arms and other munitions of war from Lagos in certain cases."" Since that time there has been a restlessness on the part of the Executive, which has been unmitigatedly evil in its tendency. He is stated to have allowed a petition to be got up by certain dependents of the Government, calling upon him to annex Porto Novo and its territories. By sundry unnecessary and threatening voyages in the colonial steamer, attended by a force of Houssas, &c., he has given colour to the belief that he has such plans in contemplation; and considering what took place in the years 1864-1867, it is not surprising that merchants and traders, the whole of whose property would be imperilled and destroyed by a renewal of the overt and secret acts of policy then committed, should even give credit to the report of their Administrator having allowed his feelings of hostility against the Egba nations so far to prevail with him over all just, honourable, humane, and politic considerations, as to induce him privately to instigate the Kings of Dahomey and Ibadan conjointly to attack, and if possible destroy Abeokuta during the present dry season.\n\nThe proper policy of Lagos, as a great emporium of trade for extensive inland countries, must manifestly be to cultivate amicable relations with all of them, and scrupulously to abstain from everything that could give rise to suspicions of hostile feelings or intentions as regards any of them.

We cannot defer the preparations for our paper until the day of its publication, and are therefore under the necessity of commenting on what is known to us at the time we write. We hope, and have reason to believe, that before our present number goes to press, we shall have received the long desired intelligence of the difficulties with Egbas, Jebus, and others being all removed; and of the long desolate markets of Lagos overflowing with produce. We have not any such news at present; but what we have, affords additional proof of the heavy responsibility that rests upon all concerned in the Government of a trading British settlement or colony, when they, through ignorance or malice, pursue a course which is calculated to bring on a commercial paralysis. By inexcusable ignorance on the part of a Secretary of State, and the very wantonness of official evil on the part of an Administrator, the trade and commerce of Lagos was arrested in its course on the 18th of March last. The authorities of the native interior countries from which Lagos draws its commercial supplies, had been goaded by repeated and incessant insults and wrongs, into a condition of mind which led them to refuse all further trading intercourse, until the official author of those insults and wrongs should be removed from the office which gave him power thus to outrage them and their people. At the first glance it would have seemed as if trade would be immediately resumed, from the moment such removal were made, and the obnoxious measures repealed and abolished; and we must confess that, although our knowledge of African thought and action is derived from the varied experience of many years, we fell into the error of believing that such would be the case in this instance. We thought the Egba authorities and the King of Jebu, knowing as they did that the grievances of which they had so much reason to complain were the unhealthy spawn of one diseased official mind alone—that the quarrel really was between them and the late Administrator of Lagos only, and not really between them and Great Britain, would have hastened to show their satisfaction at the removal of their official enemy from his post and power, and have at once set free the fettered hands of commerce. It has not been so. Captain Glover was sent away from Lagos by Mr. Pope Hennessey, on the 15th June—and all obnoxious decrees, irritating and injurious to the Egbas and others, were at the same time repealed; but yet, up to the 6th August at least, the Egbas and Jebus had not removed their interdict on trade. The venom was still rankling in the veins of those who had been stung, and a sense of offended dignity prevented the due consideration of the evils resulting to their own subjects and territories, as well as to Lagos and its traders, from the prohibition to export that produce on which the wealth and progress of both the one and the other depend. Lagos and its native traders and merchants especially have been thus doomed to a prolonged continuance of those evils to which we briefly alluded in our last; and in the paralysis of all available means for paying debts and obligations, the law—British law—has handed the unfortunate fish to the greedy cormorants who are ever ready to seek their unjust gains among the necessities of their fellow-men. British officials spear the fish—British magistrates net them—and British cormorants devour them. We feel it to be our duty, therefore, to repeat the protest we made in our last, against the uninterrupted action of commercial law, through British legal authorities and tribunals, at periods when the British governing power has chosen for its own ends, or in its own ignorance or wickedness, to cut off from the trading masses of the community, those means by which alone they could be enabled to meet their commercial engagements. During the perturbation caused by the late French and German war—during the siege of Paris, and the reign of the Commune, and for some time after, no creditor was allowed to put the machinery of law at work in France, for the enforcement of civil contracts, to despoil and ruin his fellow-citizen. And thus it ought to have been in Lagos during this suspension of trade, which resulted entirely from acts of Government, and not from any acts or errors of individual traders, or from any cause which any one individual of the trading community, or the whole body of them combined, could suspend or control. They did what they could by remonstrance, by petition, by communication to the Home authorities, and through the African Times; and having done this, they are none of them morally, however they may be made legally, responsible for the results against which they petitioned and remonstrated. We do not need any spirit to come from the other world to tell us that these remarks of ours will not produce the effects they ought to produce. The duty of a public writer is not limited by the extent of his power to procure the justice to which he may establish a claim. It is his duty to hold aloft the lamp of truth, and leave the results of his so doing to others. It is at least a consolation to victims, if the light thus diffused, shall enable every observer to see that the wheels which are crushing the poor victims of commercial misgovernment, are official ones; that they have not voluntarily thrown themselves under them with suicidal intent, but have been thrust under them by an erring Secretary of State, and the malicious wantonness of official power in his delegate, to whom the victim was bound to yield unresistingly.

Pope Hennessy, Esq., Administrator-in-Chief of the West African Settlement.**\n\nThe merchants and traders of the Settlement of Lagos beg to be allowed to bring to your notice the following facts, which materially affect their interests as a commercial community.\n\nLagos is the natural port for a very large portion of Central and Western Africa, comprising the whole of the thickly-populated and industrious kingdoms of the Jebus, Yorubas, and Egbas, including the many tribes on and beyond the banks of the Niger to the northward of Porto Novo, and Wetu to the westward, and the important commercial districts of Palma and Leckie to the eastward. It is necessary, for the purpose of developing the resources of these countries, that all the roads leading to them should be kept perfectly free and open, and it is their opinion that an end so desirable can only be attained by a policy, on the part of this Government, of non-interference in the politics of the surrounding countries, in which Lagos can have no possible concern. For some time past the policy of non-intervention has been disregarded, and one of an opposite character substituted, which has led to a stoppage of the Abeokuta roads, and threats of immediate closing of others. The policy of intervention above-mentioned is exemplified by following facts.\n\nIn the latter part of 1869 a blockade of Iheri was established by Tywo, who left Lagos openly with an armed expedition for the purpose of recovering his own debts; on his arrival, he seized several persons (about twenty) as hostages, took them to Ikorudu, and kept them until part of his debts were paid.\n\nThe blockade lasted six months, and was detrimental to trade in Lagos, and only beneficial to Tywo himself, all business with Iheri being stopped, and his monopoly complete. One incident occurred as follows: About thirty Lagos traders went to Iheri, but on the way, beyond the jurisdiction of this Government, a Lagos constable challenged the party, which disavowed his authority and proceeded to the market; on their return, they were arrested and taken to Government House, and subsequently imprisoned for one month by the police magistrate.\n\nTywo, who is a native trader of great influence, has been further supported by this Government on many occasions, to the detriment of independent trade here. For instance, about two months ago, he stopped all Egba trade except through Iheri, forcing Egba traders to sell at that market instead of coming themselves to Lagos, and only allowing those canoes to pass down that were directed to his factory here. A new measure of produce was introduced here, which met with great opposition on the part of the natives, but it was enforced by the constable sent from Lagos; some leading merchants here complained to the Government of this interference, and offered direct proof of the facts, but could obtain no satisfaction.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_06_1872#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

Mr. Editor, we ask, what had Captain Glover to do with the internal arrangements of the interior people? The Egbas and Jebus never closed their roads against the Ibadans for goods, rum, hoop-iron, &c., and produce—only for ammunition; and that was at the request of all the interior kings and chiefs, including the King of Oyo, their master, because the Ibadans don\'t care about lawful trade, but only for war, kidnapping, and committing raids—their king being unable to control them. We maintain, then, that, so long as we get produce and sell off our goods, Captain Glover had no right to be a busybody in the internal arrangements of foreign countries. Captain Glover unlawfully - scoured secretly for about two years to break the internal arrangements (although trade in goods and produce was going on), and, not being successful, he tried all he could to separate the Jebus and Egbas under false pretences, for their destruction. Not being successful in this, he, in September, 1871, prohibited the sale of ammunition, knives, hoop-iron, nails, &c., to the Jebus and Egbas, and forced Mr. Goldsworthy to go on April 12th, 1872, through bushes and jungles which he calls the new road, to enable him to plead that because he is opening a new road the Egbas and Jebus got jealous, and closed theirs.

To add to this suspicion and distrust, the first Governor who was sent to rule the newly acquired settlement in 1862 (the late Governor Freeman), set himself up, and acted so loftily in all his communications with Abeokuta, that the Egbas became embittered against him, and he increased this bitter feeling by sending on to Abeokuta in May, 1862) Consul Taylor, whom the British Government sent to reside in Abeokuta, in so unceremonious and off-handed a manner—instead of doing things according to native ideas and customs, by first sending civil and polite messages, and so preparing them to receive him—that the Egbas refused to receive him. They were already made suspicious and distrustful of the English by the Governor's acts towards them, as prior to this Governor Freeman was known to have been sending messages to the Ibadan, with whom they were then at war, by Captain Glover (then commanding Her Majesty's ship Handy in these Lagoons), against whom the Egbas entertained bitter feelings for having, during his travels to and from the Niger in previous years, through the Egba territory, forcibly carried away a large number of Houssas (slaves of the Egbas) to the Niger territory. Instead of trying to remove this feeling by mild and courteous acts and expressions in all his communications, he continued to write imperious, insulting, and threatening letters to the Egbas, telling them in plain language that their country would be taken away from them if they continued to quarrel with the English Government at Lagos. Now I ask, Mr. Editor, were not the Egbas justified in resenting, in the best way possible, expressions such as these? In short, the Egbas remained sour with Lagos. When Governor Freeman left for England, Commodore Wilmot (now Admiral Wilmot), then commanding Her Majesty's naval squadron on the West Coast, came to Lagos, and went up to Abeokuta with the acting Governor, Captain W. R. Mulliner, to try and appease the Egbas, and put matters right again; but immediately on their return to Lagos, and before the good Commodore could do anything, Captain Glover arrived as Lieutenant-Governor; and it is known how much squabbling there was between the Commodore and Captain Glover, because the Commodore could not agree with Captain Glover in his intended policy. Captain Glover's name, for the cause already stated, set the Egbas in fresh rage, as they considered that they were no longer safe. Hence arose all the troubles and annoyances which the Egbas gave to Lagos. Added to this is their having been desired by Captain Glover privately—when he went to their camp at Makun, to treat with them—to come and destroy the town of Ikorodu, to revenge both themselves for Ikorodu having sided with the Ibadans in the war, and Captain Glover for the insolence of the Ikorodus to him when he went to their town in 1862; the Egbas little thinking that it was only a scheme of Captain Glover's to draw them near the Lagoon, and so expose themselves to the fire of rockets and shells which he had prepared for them in aid of the Ikorodus. On that day when he suddenly fired upon them in March, 1865, the Egbas lost over 700 persons killed. Can they be expected ever to forget this act of treachery on Captain Glover's part? This deep wound remained in the minds of the Egbas and continued to rankle in their breasts, so that they determined to drive the white men from their country. This it was that moved them to plunder and drive out the white missionaries from Abeokuta in 1867, when they heard that Captain Glover was placing constables in all the towns along the road from Ebute Metta to Otta. They looked upon it, not as intended to protect the road from lawlessness, which was a pretence, but as an occupying of the country which intervenes between Lagos and the Egba territory, which occupation they looked upon as a preliminary step towards encroaching upon and occupying all their territory; for, said the Egbas, so long as these white men remain among us, so long shall we have endless troubles with Lagos. After this, matters remained quiet, no doubt from some check to further action being sent to Lagos from the Colonial-office. Trade went on, and confidence was beginning to be restored, as many of the old chiefs died in the meantime, and the people began to be interested in lawful commerce; and had Capt. Glover allowed this quietness to continue and not have interfered with the internal policy of the Egbas and Ijebus in their dealings with the Ibadans—their interior and warlike neighbours—the trade of Lagos would have remained undisturbed and flourishing, and all the commercial disasters which have recently taken place would have been unknown. But no! Captain Glover would not have the Egbas and Ijebus do what they think best for their own country's safety. He tried to bully and bribe both Egbas and Ijebus to give open roads to the Ibadans in the beginning of 1871; and because they would not be bribed nor bullied, nor allow him to dictate to them, he prohibited the export from Lagos not only of arms and munitions of war to the Egba and Ijebu territories, but also all sorts of iron, nails, cask-hoops, farming-implements, &c.; at the same time that he got the Ibadans to assist him in frightening the tribes bordering on the eastern side of the Ijebu territory, north-east of Lagos, into opening a road for the Ibadans by which they might obtain supplies of arms and ammunition to strengthen their hands in attacking and fighting the Egbas and Ijebus, and forcibly obtaining the short road to the coast through the Ijebu country. This so irritated the Egbas and Ijebus, that they concluded to stop all trade with Lagos, so that the white man, who was giving them so much trouble and so harassing them, and whose acts were imperilling their safety, should go out of the country. They therefore closed the trade in March, 1872."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-03-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRUE STATEMENTS OF THE CAUSE OF LAGOS DISASTERS.—No. II.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—After perusing the several articles in the English papers (especially the _Manchester Courier_) on the affairs of Lagos, I feel that it is only fair and just to Governor Pope Hennessy that I should relate in your valuable columns a brief history of the cause of differences between the Lagos Government and the Egbas and Ijebus which have caused them to close their trade against Lagos up to this time; and being an African and knowing my countrymen, I think you will agree with me that my statements claim more credence than any which Mr. Charles Leigh Clare (who only wrote from hearsay, and has never been in Lagos) has or can make.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

In fact, even Capt. Glover used to send away wives with their husbands, after he returned from England in 1866, and so things went on smoothly; but later, when he had an object in view, he permitted his ragamuffin Ijayi and Yorubas friends to go and entice wives and slaves away, and took steamers into the rivers and creeks, to annoy the people, and make them the means of domestic slaves escaping from their masters.

Next day, the women were taken to the Governor, and on inquiry they owned, that the two men are their husbands, and that they are their wives.

The French and British declarations of protectorates in the area between 1862 and 1863 did not enjoy official ratification and had to be abandoned in the 1870s. But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'The events that marked the real turning point, however, were the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 and a British naval action against Porto Novo later the same year.$^{34}$ These two British actions naturally sensitized the French, who had considerable commercial interests in Whydah and Porto Novo. Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west.

This was signified by her partici› pation with Britain in the dual control of Egypt (1879), the dispatch of Savorgnan de Brazza into the Congo and the ratification of his treaties with Chief Makoko of the Bateke, and the revival of French colonial initiative in both Tunisia and Madagascar. 36 These moves on the part of these powers between 1876 and 1880 gave a clear indication that they were all now committed to colonial expansion and the establishment of formal control in Africa, and it was this that finally compelled both Britain and Germany to abandon their preference for informal control and influence in favour of a formal policy leading to their annexations in Southern, East and West Africa from the end of 1883 onwards.$^{37}$ The German initiative, for instance, resulted in the annex› ation of South West Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and German East Africa, which in turn further accelerated the pace of the Scramble.\nBy the early 1880s, the Scramble was well under way, and it was out of fear of being pushed out of Africa altogether that Portugal proposed the calling of an international conference to sort out the territorial disputes in the area of Central Africa. It seems evident from the above, then, that it was not the British occupation of Egypt in 1882 that triggered off the Scramble, as has been argued by Robinson and Gallagher,$^{38}$ but rather the events of the period 1876 to 1880 in different parts of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Global strategy', 'content': 'There is a third school which maintains that the European interest in Africa which gave rise to the Scramble was a matter of global strategy, not economics. The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century.

The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era.

They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it.

This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started.

While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone.

On the contrary, I should rather have thought it incumbent upon it to do so in defence of the rights of the British Government, and for the safety and actual preservation of Lagos as a colony (for its commercial welfare had already been seriously jeopardised by Porto Novo being lost to us; and had the French authorities been allowed to continue their course unmolested, the trade of this place, already so seriously injured, must have been completely annihilated); but the fact is, that the acquisitive spirit exhibited by the French, and which they were so insidiously working out, acting in one direction upon this Government, and in another upon the people of Okeodan and Addo, induced the latter to _throw themselves into the arms of the English_, rather than fall under the domination of the King of Porto Novo and his covetously-disposed protectors.

This they have done in more than one instance on the Coast of Africa, and it was not to be believed that they would act differently at Porto Novo. In fact, so early as June last they had hoisted their flag at Appa, only three miles from Badagry; and their claims were daily increasing in the most preposterous and alarming manner; they claimed as belonging to the King of Porto Novo, and consequently to them, Badagry, and some other places much nearer to Lagos, and doubtless as soon as their English neighbours were disposed of they would have turned their attention to the interior, but were luckily forestalled.'}, {'id': 474, 'article_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'full_section_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': '* Vide our September Number.\n\naltogether""!!

It would be well, we think, for the interests of Christian civilization that the whole of the West African countries should be under British government or influence; but this is impossible. There is national pride involved in other quarters. The French, for instance, have theirs; and it seems to us ridiculous to suppose, for even a single moment, that they would so sacrifice their national pride to ours, as to accept a sum of money as an equivalent for their West African settlements and claims, even supposing that Great Britain would make such pecuniary offer. There is, however, no power in any British Government to make such offer. We picture to ourselves a Prime Minister or a Chancellor of the Exchequer announcing such an offer on the part of Her Majesty\'s Government, and asking for the sum required. It would be a political suicide. The suggestion that Great Britain should acquire by other means than the surrender of a territorial equivalent the French possessions and claims in West Africa, does not therefore merit any serious consideration. We admit that it would be in every way advisable if practicable. There we stop. But does it therefore follow that, this being impracticable, the British Government should fold their arms—should say, ""There is a lion in the path""; and so give up all hope of ""carrying forward that process of development or improvement on which they have entered."" With such a prospect as is opening before them at the Gold Coast, this would be simply disgraceful. We now want something that the French have got; we did not in 1869-70, but we do now. Then Assinee and Grand Bassam, with any supposed claims on Porto Novo, were matters of so much indifference to Great Britain, that the Gaboon and withdrawal from all south of the River Cazamansa were not at all an adequate equivalent for the by them so greatly desired River Gambia. The Gambia is a noble river. Having sang its praises aforetime, we shall not depreciate it now. We wish, from African as well as British considerations, that it could be retained, and we shall grieve for it when it is gone from us; but when we estimate the good that has been effected by British Government and influence there—see how small it is and how little hope there is of its being increased without the application of Imperial funds, which there is no chance of obtaining, and contrast these with the prospects of advantage to be gained by the sole possession of the Sierra Leone network of rivers and the whole of the seaboard of the new Gold Coast Colony, together with the Gaboon,—we dare not hesitate in our decision. True, all that we have enumerated and that Great Britain, as we have understood, is to obtain in lieu of the Gambia, are worth really nothing to France; while the Gambia will be of great pecuniary value to her, enabling her, as it will, to control the whole of the countries between the Senegal, where she has so firmly and at so great a cost established her sway, and the Cazamansa—magnificent rivers and rich and extensive territories, rendered more valuable by their proximity to Europe. But what of this? We cannot play among the nations the part of Dog in the Manger. If we cannot eat the hay ourselves, we have no right to deny it to others who can eat it. We have proved by our 200 years\' occupation of the River Gambia that we either do not know how to develop its resources and spread civilization through its countries, or do not care to use the means for effecting it; while the French think they can and will do all this, withdrawing at the same time in our favour from other points where they are even more useless for good than we have been in the River Gambia, but where we, under the impulse and in the carrying out of a new and active policy, believe we can labour with success, while they are indispensable to full success in adjacent countries already under our government or influence. We feel constrained to take this view of the question; and, taking this view, we cannot oppose the desires of Her Majesty\'s Government in the matter, unless reasons can be shown to us which we do not at present perceive. It was our intention, in commencing this article on a subject so important to West African interests, to show how the exchange, if effected between the two Governments, may be made the means of that of Great Britain for the advancement of those great interests of Christian civilization, and material and industrial development of resources, for which we have been unweariedly striving, and which it has now seriously undertaken to promote; but we must reserve this for the present. The letter of Mr. R. B. W. Walker to the Standard, which we elsewhere insert, and to which that of ""Everybody"" is a reply, shows, we think, clearly enough that the Gaboon is not so very insignificant a river, although it would have had but small weight with us against the Gambia. And, in concluding, we have again to remark that not one word of remonstrance has come to us from that river. When the steamship Volta was telegraphed from Madeira, the telegram stated that she was bringing over a deputation from the Gambia to Her Majesty\'s Government to show cause against the projected exchange. The list of passengers does not, however, show us the arrival of any such deputation. Should it hereafter come, we shall be ready to give due weight to its every argument, although we cannot imagine any new one calculated to change our present view,—that although the withdrawal from the Gambia is for many reasons to be deplored, it must be submitted to as a means by which facilities may be obtained for beneficial exertion in other portions of Western Africa.'}, {'id': 4404, 'article_title': 'GAMBIA.—LAW COURTS, JURIES, TRADE.', 'full_section_title': 'GAMBIA.—LAW COURTS, JURIES, TRADE.', 'last_edit_date': '02-17-1882', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_04_1882', 'content': 'The announcement that five chiefs of the Fouta-Jallon country have arrived at Paris, to be introduced to French civilization, bears out what has been rumoured since the return of the Gouldsbury Expedition from the Upper Gambia as to the renewed activity of our Gallic neighbours in that direction, and their success in winning over the natives at the back of the Sierra Leone settlement. When the English expedition penetrated to the Fouta-Jallon country about this time last year, a few French agents had recently visited Timbo for the purpose of establishing a factory there; but the chiefs, who traded mainly with Sierra Leone, were undecided which Power to support, and it is open to inference that if a little more enterprise had been displayed by our lethargic Colonial Office, the five representatives of the Fulah race would have been ""doing"" London now instead of Paris. It may be asked what concern we have with African tribes dwelling outside our settlements, but to this a satisfactory reply is easy. Our colonies along the West Coast of Africa are mainly mere trading ports; the inner region, although well worth governing, being left to the control, or want of control, of the natives. Such an arrangement, under ordinary circumstances, might have been left as it was, but of late years France, having pushed from the coast in the direction of Timbuctoo, has begun to move south, with the object of swallowing up all the native region at the back of our settlements, and reducing the latter to the condition of insignificant oases in the continent of Gallic rule. It is obvious that our interest is most directly concerned in this aggressive movement; since its tendency is to completely ruin the Gambia settlement and Sierra Leone, and render them worthless possessions. On this account, we trust that Lord Lyons will keep an eye upon any negotiations that may take place at Paris between the French authorities and the Fulah chiefs for the annexation of Fouta-Jallon, and that the whole subject of French aggressiveness in Senegambia may be exposed to a thorough discussion in Parliament.'}, {'id': 5148, 'article_title': 'FRANCE AND THE CONGO STATE', 'full_section_title': 'FRANCE AND THE CONGO STATE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1885#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_07_1885', 'content': 'M.

The letter is dated Bonduku, May 6. M. Monnier begins in a complaining mood. He accuses the English commissioners of taking it for granted that the territories of the Sanwi and the Indenie were not legitimately under French authority, and of making the chiefs of these countries accept the English colours instead of the French. ""Captain Lang acted as if he thought the treaty had been carefully arranged. He wished to carry our frontier back to Comoe on the West, thus cutting off communication between Bonduku and the coast, and compromising our relations with the country of Kong. Yet the protocol of June 1891, in complement of the arrangement of August 1889, is sufficiently formal. It stipulates that the frontier shall follow as far as possible the 5° deg. of longitude, and expressly states that Captain Binger\'s chart shall be the basis of the work of delimitation.""\n\nM. Monnier asserts that Captain Lang cannot and does not deny this, but that he has discovered some pretext for postponing further negotiations until he shall have heard from his Government. ""The English, after having pushed their point of vantage as far as Bonduku, and after a stay of three or four days in this town, where they had a more than chilly reception, struck camp. Captain Lang, having learned that Ardjima, King of Labron, our [the French] *protégé*, an old acquaintance of Captain Binger\'s, was very keen about seeing the latter again, hurried off to Zaranou to pay his respects to the native monarch, who could have got on very well without them.

The cablegram says the Governor was stopped by the French and Konnohs at Coongeah, or Loongeah, and that they threatened to kill him. The Governor in question is Colonel F. Cardew, who sailed from Liverpool on February 28 last to take up the administration of the Sierra Leone colony in succession to Sir Francis Fleming. Colonel Cardew appears to have lost no time in going into the interior. The Konnohs are the tribe that attempted to stop the advance of the West India Regiment under the command of the late Colonel Ellis, just prior to the deplorable French and English collision. The West Indians at that time drove the Konnohs before them from place to place, and it was then thought that they had received a lesson that would have lasted them for years. It is therefore feared that they have taken courage at some action of the French, although it is scarcely believed that the French would incite them to oppose the English Governor. It is also not credited here that the threat to kill the Governor was made by the French, but must have been on the part of the Konnohs. Loongeah or Coongeah cannot be located, but there is an important town called Lungay, between Tagreer and Scarciss on the Bullon Shore in the Kaffwee-Bullon district. It is believed that Governor Cardew had not taken troops up with him on this mission, beyond his official staff and carriers, but all of the West India men have returned from Bathurst, and are at present in Sierra Leone, and would be ready for any immediate orders.\n\nIt should be added that up to the time of our going to press, the Foreign Office has received no information in support of the statement made above, that the life of Governor Cardew has been threatened, and it is maintained that if such were really the case the Home authorities would have secured some official confirmation of the report.'}, {'id': 6463, 'article_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY.', 'full_section_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-4', 'issue_date': '02_07_1894', 'content': 'No exception can be taken by England to either the tone or the diction of the circular just addressed by M.

It is unquestionable that France, in spite of many splendid opportunities, has conspicuously failed as a colonising Power, and the thought comes naturally to Frenchmen that this must be the fault of administrative incapacity. M. Delcassé will, therefore, have public opinion with him in his call for a new departure better calculated than the present system to help forward the development of colonial industry and commerce. But the Colonial Minister commits one huge oversight; to be a founder of successful and prosperous colonies, a European nation must systematically pursue peace towards its neighbours. A war policy in Europe and a peace policy outside that area are incompatible; the resources that ought to be devoted to external development are drained by the maintenance of bloated armaments at home. At the present moment, France has every need to husband her resources for the several foreign adventures in which she is engaged. If the *Figaro* may be believed, Siam is still to be kept under the harrow, although the Bangkok Government has complied with every condition of the late treaty.

The fall of the Cabinet presided over by M. Casimir-Périer happening on the day this agreement was made known to the French public prevented this feeling finding expression in the French Parliament, as the members of the Chamber had before them nobody to question. The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy. If the Foreign Office wants to prevent so general an opposition from becoming acute it will aim at such an arrangement as may put an end to so dangerous an antagonism, and afford a gratification to the reasonable ambitions of both great nations, whose enormous colonial territories are indeed sufficient.”'}, {'id': 6488, 'article_title': 'THE FRANCO-BELGIAN DISPUTE IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRANCO-BELGIAN DISPUTE IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'last_edit_date': '08-01-1894', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_08_1894', 'content': '\n\nIt appears—if the organs of the French Ministry may be relied upon—that the force which is to leave France this month for Africa, under the command of Captain Monteil, will number when it has joined the contingent of Captain Decazes, now guarding the Ubanghui, about 600 men and 18 or 20 officers. It must be noted that this force, backed up as it will be by two gunboats, several steam launches and lighters for transport purposes, consists, not of raw, undisciplined Native levies, but for the most part of white soldiers of the Foreign Legion and Senegalese tirailleurs, men who besides being well drilled and armed, are inured to the African climate. The officers, too, who have been chosen, are picked men. Captain Monteil is well known for his remarkable voyage, lasting two years and a half, in the course of which he traversed Africa from west to north, beginning at St. Louis and ending at Tripoli, a voyage of which the result has been to increase tenfold French ambition, and to establish, or at any rate to lay the foundation, of French influence in countries where no Frenchman had set foot before. Over and above this fact several of the officers accompanying him have also seen service in Africa. One of them was for many years an active political agent on the Upper Niger; another was with Captain Binger in his lengthy exploration of the Gold and Ivory Coast ""hinterlands""; all are men of exceptional merit. When we consider all this; when we are very palpably and unpleasantly made aware of the fierce opposition of France to the Anglo-Belgian agreement; when we are plainly informed of the ambitious schemes she nourished with regard to Africa generally; when her Chauvinists bring home to us with praiseworthy frankness that they intend to use every means in their power to prevent this country from monopolising the course of the Nile, surely it becomes imperative that we should be informed of the ultimate destination of this expedition. But even then, even if we receive binding and definite assurances from the French Government that no advance to the Nile is included in the instructions handed to Captain Monteil, we have still much room for doubt as to whether those instructions will not be exceeded. Former experiences have taught us that when French officers embark on some military enterprise in Africa, and think that by making a great coup they can cover themselves with glory, they will do so, instructions or no instructions, knowing well that no French Ministry is strong enough to convict them for breach of discipline in the teeth of popular admiration. It behoves, then, the Government of this country to watch with the greatest attention the developments of the Franco-Belgian dispute. England cannot remain inactive in the face of the feverish activity displayed by other Powers. France must never be allowed to establish herself on the Nile under pretext of protecting the rights of the Ottoman Empire, or under any other pretext. We are willing to meet her in other ways, as far as our national dignity and our national interests will permit us, but she must clearly understand once and for all that the Nile she must not touch. Meanwhile, how do we stand? What guarantees have we? What line of action are we about to adopt? These are questions to which the people of Great Britain expect an answer, and that promptly, before dilatoriness and vacillation shall have had time to work incalculable injury to interests of which the stupendous future magnitude is, even at this day, but imperfectly realised.—*Pall Mall Gazette.*'}, {'id': 6570, 'article_title': 'FRANCE ON THE CONGO', 'full_section_title': 'FRANCE ON THE CONGO', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-15', 'issue_date': '04_05_1895', 'content': 'Perhaps these rumours are entirely groundless.

After cautioning his audience not to give too easy credence to rumours from Africa, he gave his own reasons for disbelieving them in the following remarkable words: ""I cannot think it possible,"" he said—and the words were read from a paper, which showed the deliberate care with which they had been selected—""that these rumours deserve credence, because the advance of a French expedition under secret instructions right from the other side of Africa into a territory over which our claims have been known for so long would be not merely an inconsistent and unexpected act, but it must be perfectly well known to the French Government that it would be an unfriendly act, and would be so viewed by England.""

The members of the deputation seem to have been imperfectly acquainted with the later developments of French activity in the regions under discussion, and not to have realized the force of the successive treaties by which the political spheres of the two countries have been gradually enclosed within geographical limits. Yet the negotiations between the two Governments which led up to the treaty of last year have been from time to time made public in all essential points. That treaty was intended to form the last link of a chain of agreements which should simplify the relations of the two Powers in that part of Africa, and it is now too late to urge the extension of our political influence into a sphere which has been assigned to France. It is impossible, in territories where the frontier is still vague, for one civilised Government to refuse to acknowledge treaties submitted to it by another on the ground that native signatories of the treaty desire to repudiate it. If such a principle were admitted the only result would be a speedy return to the primitive reign of force. Peaceful agreements with native chiefs would have no meaning, and the civilisation of barbarous countries must be preceded by military occupation.

From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia.

In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades.

A section of the German Press is taking an anti-English line in respect to the negotiations as to the Hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony and Togoland. This time, however, no ground exists for any cause of alarm on the part of German patriots, and an appeal to Berlin has elicited the statement that what is being done in those regions is with the consent and with the knowledge of both Governments. It is not only of England's advance in Western Africa that German colonists are jealous; a similar state of feeling is entertained, if not openly expressed, towards France. For many reasons this sentiment of suspicion is to be deplored. It handicaps the progress of civilisation, and causes outbursts of ill-temper that do not harmonise with the friendly relations existing between the different European Powers interested in that part of the globe. The matters in dispute are soon rectified, but a feeling of irritation is set up which is not so quickly forgotten. On the Gulf of Guinea, excluding the Republic of Liberia, are situated the French possessions of Assinie and Dahomey, the Gold Coast Colony, the Colony of Lagos, and the Niger Protectorate belonging to Great Britain, and Togoland under the protection of Germany. Originally the frontiers of these territories were open at the rear, and their boundaries were ill-defined, owing to incorrect surveys, disputed titles, and conflicting tribal claims. But of late a change has taken place in this respect. Various treaties have been entered into between England and France, so that the French frontier difficulties have been considerably modified, and a line of future action agreed upon. In 1890, a further step was taken as regards internal delimitation. The French Government, noting that the progress of the two countries must, if unchecked, lead to conflicting claims, suggested that a point should be selected beyond which neither Power should pass. This suggestion was effected by a declaration providing a basis for negotiations for the demarcation of spheres in the regions which extend to the west and to the south of the Middle and Upper Niger. As regards German frontier questions, the Agreement which ceded Heligoland to Germany defines the boundary line between Togoland and the Gold Coast Colony. North of that boundary lies what is known as the neutral zone, within which both parties to the Agreement have bound themselves not to acquire Protectorate.

The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands. It is the neck of the bottle through which the trade of the colony flows, and this is recognised by the French no less than by the English colonists. France is therefore doing her utmost to obtain such a modification of the Convention above referred to as will give her control over this trade centre. The bait held out to our Government is some concession in that no-man\'s-land, the region around Lake Chad. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are alarmed at the danger which threatens their trade, and have pointed out to Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford that Sierra Leone is of great strategical importance to the Empire, and that the cession of Fararma to France, by enabling the French to deflect the trade to their Senegal and Niger colonies, must result in the destruction of the commerce of Sierra Leone and in its eventually being absorbed into the French colonies, by which it is even now almost entirely hemmed in.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Madeira, Oct. 8.**\n\nIntelligence from the Congo, brought here by the steamer Mandingo, reports that the French have taken possession of El Obey Point, where they are establishing factories, and distributing flags among the natives.

Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent.

To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire.

Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved. Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language. The problems of nation-building posed by such a medley of peoples have not proved to be easily soluble.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The British consuls on the coast tried to use these inter-state wars as a lever to obtain an opening for their own traders and missionaries to move into the hinterland. The consuls served as mediators between the states in the making of peace treaties. Thus, consular-mediated treaties were signed between Bonny and Elem Kalahari (New Calabar) in 1871, Opobo and Bonny in 1873, Bonny and Elem Kalahari in 1879, Elem Kalahari and Okrika in 1871, Nembe and Elem Kalahari in 1871. The inter-state wars did not weaken the resolve of each of the states to keep European traders from encroaching on their spheres of trade or in the maintenance of their sovereignty. The British had clashed with King William Pepple of Bonny as early as 1854, when they exiled him to Fernando Po, Ascension, Sierra Leone and London. They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence. Also in 1898, King Ibanichuka of Okrika was seized by the British consul for his refusal to take orders from the new British Protectorate government of Southern Nigeria. King Koko of Nembe managed to escape capture by hiding in remote villages in his kingdom.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, then, the British had taken over political control of the eastern Niger delta and, for the first two or three decades of the twentieth century, the states could not crown new kings.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""They condemned the right assumed by the European powers of exchanging or partitioning countries between them without reference to, or regard for, the wishes of the people, which they declared to be tanta› mount to a species of slavery.

Finally, the Conference resolved itself into a National Congress of British West Africa, and determined to represent its views to London.\nA delegation in which The Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Nigeria were represented, went to London in 1920 to petition His Majesty's Government to grant elective representation to the four colonies (see Plate 25.2).

In this open opposition the traditional rulers could not join them. Their continued survival depended on the colonial power and this tied their hands. Also for the most part the traditional rulers were not sufficiently educated to participate meaningfully in the highfaluting debates of the new elites. In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place. Because they did not side with the new elites, the latter regarded them as the lackeys of imperialism. They in turn regarded the new elites as revolutionaries who wanted to destroy im› memorial custom and turn the world upside down.\nTo make matters worse the two were driven by imperialist propaganda into engaging in a struggle over who spoke for the people. The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices.

Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 328, 'article_title': 'Abeokuta, Okeodan, and Addo', 'full_section_title': 'Abeokuta, Okeodan, and Addo', 'last_edit_date': '01-01-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': 'We ought, too, it seems, according to them, to have helped them to destroy the Ibadans, that they might have preserved their slave hunting-grounds.

The sale and gift of lands at Ebute Meta by the Lagos Government, constituting as this does an absolute claim and assumption of British authority over that portion of the main land, is a measure of such extreme importance as bearing upon the present and future relations between the British colony of Lagos and the native government of Abeokuta, that nothing short of the most imperious necessity, and the most indisputable and indefeasible claim, can possibly justify such proceedings. There is no portion of the West Coast at which the development of productive resources and the increase of commerce, may be so rapid as in the Abeokuta Territories (with Yoruba generally) and Lagos, provided there be a constantly good and friendly understanding and amicable relations between Lagos and Abeokuta. But for this it is essential that nothing should be done on the part of the Island Government to wound the just susceptibilities, or aggravate the unfortunate distrust of the Abeokutans, as regards British encroachment. The progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Yoruba countries and primarily among the Aku people, and the increase of the trade of Lagos, are desired results necessarily bound up together and inseparably united. It is not for the permanent mercantile interests of Lagos that she should be mixed up with the wars and disputes of the interior, except as a great civilised pacificator—as the representative of British Christian civilisation acting for the amelioration of adjacent heathen lands. But if Lagos holds absolute possession on the main land, she can scarcely fail to be involved in such native wars and disputes; and it must be expected that questions will continually arise to disturb the friendly intercourse of Lagos with the interior. We regard this matter of the present and future relations of Lagos with the main-land people, and especially with Abeokuta, as one of such very great importance, that we feel it to be our duty to solicit for it the prompt and especial attention of the Governor-in-Chief. Among the gross neglects of duty of Governor Blackall we look upon his conduct as regards this important matter, as one of the most serious, and at the same time, most irritating to native susceptibilities and suspicions. We see with pleasure that the Governor of Lagos has been lately invited to Sierra Leone by the Governor-in-Chief; doubtless for those explanations as regards the Lagos Government which could scarcely be fully given without a personal interview; and as the facts, real or supposed, as viewed by the local Lagos Executive, and the views of that Executive, will now have been brought under the keen and impartial mental scrutiny of Sir Arthur Kennedy, we look forward with hope and confidence to some action of the Governor-in-Chief, that shall lead to a speedy placing of the relations of Lagos with Abeokuta, and *vice versa*, on a just and friendly footing, such as will tend to the permanent reciprocal advantage of the inhabitants of the British colony and of the adjacent native territories.'}, {'id': 1410, 'article_title': 'What Caused the Heathen Uprising in Abeokuta on Sunday, Oct. 13, 1867', 'full_section_title': 'What Caused the Heathen Uprising in Abeokuta on Sunday, Oct. 13, 1867', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-28', 'issue_date': '23_09_1868', 'content': 'In reading the correspondence between the two Governments, I find that the Administrator sent about five or six letters to the Bashorun, Akoda, Asah, Jaguna, &c., but that these were all returned unopened in consequence of their not being sent through the right and usual course (the Secretary); the Bashorun was therefore obliged to order that the churches and chapels in his town should be closed till Administrator Glover chooses to remove the constables off the Egba territories, as he could not see why the missionaries should be preaching in one part and Glover cunningly taking the other part, beginning from Ebute Meta. This happened on the morning of the above date; the churches and chapels were therefore closed, and the hundreds of war-boys (who were but too ready to go after the constables), suspecting both missionaries and merchants to be cognisant of the Administrator\'s proceedings, about twelve and four o\'clock of same day, fell upon missionaries, merchants, traders, and all those whom they thought connected with them, and destroyed almost everything belonging to them.\n\nThese are the true facts, Mr. Editor, and could bear the strictest test.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

He urges that he formerly received 2,000l. a-year from the duty on exports, with import duties on tobacco and cowries, besides fines and fees, whilst the presents of the merchants contributed largely to his revenue.

The Franco-German War put an end to them for the time, but they were renewed in 1876, when the proposal that Great Britain should cede the Gambia to France, and that France should in return renounce all claims and influence over the West African Coast from the Rio Pongas to the Gaboon, was rendered abortive by the opposition of the British trading interests concerned. Petitions from the English community of the Gambia against the transfer were so strongly supported in this country that Lord Carnarvon abandoned the scheme, and the field was left open to French and German enterprise. Three years later the seizure of the island of Matacong aroused fresh interest in the subject, and negotiations, which led to the arrangement of 1882, were entered into. By this agreement it was hoped to fix the boundaries between French and English territory to the north of Sierra Leone. A convention was concluded, but the French Chamber refused to ratify it, and though it remained as a basis of agreement between the Governments it was never formally accepted. In August 1889 an agreement was concluded by joint commissioners appointed for the purpose and accepted by the Parliaments of both countries. By this agreement no exchange of territory was made.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Serious Troubles in British Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'News of serious trouble in or near the British Gambia Settlement has lately been received in Liverpool.

This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

More importantly, the reports in both the American and British press and other reports by foreign missionaries and visitors accused the Liberian government and certain influential Americo-Liberians of practising slavery, recruiting forced and indentured labour, and exporting or selling migrant labour to European colonies especially to the Spanish island-colony of Fernando Po. 80 Britain spearheaded the foreign attack, condemning the exports and demanding, as in 1907-9, that to ameliorate the unfavourable conditions in Liberia, her government should be placed under European control. 81 The United States similarly berated Liberia about \'the so-called ""export"" of labour from Liberia to Fernando Po ... which seems hardly distinguish› able from organized slave trade\'.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Liberia', 'content': ""The Americo-Liberians practised an essentially western culture in their life style, political institutions, through the use of the English language, individual ownership and perpetual alienation of land, and their adherence to Christianity and monogamy.

To all this must be added, in the case of Ethiopia, her military strength. On the other hand, Ethiopia gained further territories while Liberia lost part of hers mainly because of the internal conditions - political, economic and military - in each of the states and of course the degree of the interference of the Europeans in these internal affairs.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved. Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

Unlike the Americo-Liberian minority, however, the Amhara-Tigreans were variously estimated at between 33 and 40% of Ethiopia\'s population. 11 Although they constituted a privileged group, actual economic and political power and high status were concentrated in some Ethiopian noble families mostly from whom the holders of high public office or titles like (in order of precedence) negus, betwoded, ras, dajazmach, andfitawrari were recruited. It was largely through these noblemen (and the armies they commanded) that Menelik had expanded Ethiopia by conquest. Thereafter he occupied the conquered territories with \'garrison settlements\' in much the same manner as did colonialists from Europe in other parts of Africa. $^{12}$ Hence many of these noblemen and their descendants, as well as descendants of the garrison settlements, government officials, \'and even Christian clergy not infrequently adopt[ed] the worst possible type of ""colonial"" approach\' or racial attitude towards other Ethiopians \'of slightly different ethnic groupings\'.$^{13}$ They prided themselves, for example, on being Ethiopia\'s empire-builders - the \'men who with their knowledge served the country and the Emperor and who handed Ethiopia down\' through the ages to posterity. \' 4 Much the same \'colonial approach\' was manifested by the AmericoLiberians in perceiving themselves as Liberia\'s nation-builders.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

At her urgent intreaty, commissioners were finally appointed by the British Government, to agree with her commissioners on a north-western boundary. But when the British commissioners came to investigate the Liberian claims, their shadowy nature was at once apparent. They were compelled to declare that she had no real ones; that beyond Cape Mount district she had really no possessions; that the Big River, instead of the coveted Shebar and the Joung, must constitute her northern boundary.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF LIBERIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'How many Englishmen have visited Liberia? Five hundred, perhaps, at the most. It lies far away from the routes pursued by tourists, and the busy world hears little and knows less of the independent negro State which nestles in a corner of the West African Coast and has been the scene of a series of experiments absolutely unique in history. It was from this part of the African coast that some attempt was to be made to develop the Dark Continent. Emancipated slaves from the United States, now citizens of a republic established by themselves in the land of their forefathers, were to be the torchbearers of civilisation and to carry the lamp of learning to their brethren in the interior. Such was the scheme of the large-hearted and liberal philanthropists who, early in the present century, founded the various colonisation societies in the United States with a view of enabling its negro population to found settlements on the West Coast of Africa. These settlements were gradually formed, and, after passing through a series of trials, eventually confederated. In 1822 the republic was declared, and in 1847 Liberia was recognised as an independent State by the sovereigns of Europe and the United States Government. From Washington the new State borrowed its constitution. Although she has enjoyed the advantage of having had at least three Presidents—E. Johnson, Russworm, and Roberts—of high character and executive ability, it would be untrue to say that the hopes of the founders of Liberia have been realised. On the contrary the Liberian Government seems to have entirely failed to win the confidence or even to gain the respect of the native kings and tribes within its supposed ""sphere of influence""; indeed, some of them resist all attempts to enforce authority within the ill-defined boundaries of the State. At the recent inauguration of the new President—the Hon. — Cheeseman—it was a matter of general satisfaction that a gunboat, ordered from a Keil dockyard, was on her way out from Germany. This boat is to be the foundation of the new Liberian Navy, and, strange to say, it is required, not for the defence of the State, but to coerce a British merchant who for three years has declined to pay customs duty on the ground that he receives no protection from Government, that there is no civilised administration in the district in which he resides, and that he is compelled to employ and pay a police force of his own. The Government, urged by German merchants to suppress their independent competitor, has signified its intention of resorting to force, and will probably find itself in a difficulty with our Foreign Office if a single shot is fired on an English factory whose owner is considered to have made out a good case for non-payment of duty. The attempts of Christian missionaries to evangelise the Western districts of Africa have been discouraging. From the year 1481, when some priests from Rome unsuccessfully endeavoured to withstand the climate, the history of Christian labour is one continuous narrative of a futile struggle against disease and death. Protestant societies in the United States have literally poured dollars by thousands into Liberia. Some good work is being done by white ministers who have formed thriving settlements up the country (where the land is fertile and the climate healthy), and have urged upon the natives the importance of cultivating rice, corn, potatoes, ginger, sugar, coffee, and arrowroot, all of which are remunerative crops. As for cotton, indigo, pepper, pineapples, and gumtrees, they grow wild, and the superior knowledge of the missionaries has enabled the natives to gather them profitably. But Christian workers have to reckon with a foe more stubborn than Paganism. Islam is gradually winning its way towards the West Coast from the interior. The sword, it is true, goes hand in hand with the green banner, but the African negro is a ready convert. He finds the precepts of the Prophet easy to understand, and the sanction of polygamy is in entire accord with his present practice. Moreover, where Mahomet gains ground, intemperance—which unhappily follows Christian missions—disappears. I have said that Liberia is fertile. It is certainly the richest district in West Africa, but it is terribly neglected, and can never thrive under its present administration. There is practically no Government. The rule of the negro is marked by selfishness and corruption. The colonisation societies in the United States have almost abandoned in despair sending out more emigrants who, on landing, finding themselves free from control, quickly become lazy and wholly useless as pioneers for opening up fresh country. It must be confessed, therefore, that, after a trial of seventy years, the American negroes have failed to erect a State worthy of the name. They have lost what little credit they had twenty years ago—not even the interest is paid on the loan of 500,000 dols. raised in London in 1870—and Liberia is gradually drifting into the hands of a few wide-awake German merchants, who are understood to have made advances to Government against valuable securities, as well as to have exerted sufficient influence in Berlin to induce General Caprivi to protest in vigorous language against the concession known as the ""indiarubber monopoly,"" granted by President Johnson to an English syndicate of company promoters under circumstances which have been severely criticised. Lord Salisbury was aware of the facts, but it yet remains to be seen whether the British Government will raise its voice against a German protectorate of Liberia.—""E.

We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much.

Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government.

The first independent civilized African State on the West Coast, she occupies a position of great honour and usefulness. With institutions framed on the model of those of the United States of America, she stands out boldly before the world asserting and proving that there is no lack of natural ability in the civilized African to work the machinery of free institutions. Her President, her judges, her learned professors, are Christian Africans; no white man holds any political position in the country; the nation is essentially negro, and is so far from feeling any need of European or American aid in carrying on the various departments of her government, that she does more than discourage, she prohibits the permanent settlement of white men within her borders. They may come there for purposes of trade, but they are not permitted to acquire landed property; African she is, and exclusively African she is determined to remain. The enemies and libellers of the African race not unfrequently point to Liberia with contempt and ridicule, because she has not obtained in infancy the development of manhood; because, having no capital but what has been created by the industry of her own people, she is not able to undertake those works of civilization which are so much needed for the rapid development of her great natural resources; because, amid the abundant elements of wealth existing in her rich tropical fertility, and with her capability of producing so many objects that Europe requires and is compelled to seek even at the opposite side of the world, her Government is poor, and her revenue insufficient, without constant patriotic self-denial on the part of her principal citizens, for the support of those establishments indispensable to a free Christian State, which includes within her borders a native heathen population more than twenty times exceeding in number the civilized population of which the State really consists. But so far from there being anything in her public condition to justify contempt and ridicule such as our ignorantly-learned anthropologists would heap upon her and her people, every impartial man will find cause in her for wonder and felicitation that a mere handful of people brought to the African Coast from the degrading servitude of the late Slave States of the great American Republic should have fallen into so few errors, and have made such rapid progress. For it must be especially borne in mind that no comparison between Liberia and an English colony would be fair. An English colony, however small the number of emigrants and their descendants may be, is constantly and from its very birth receiving assistance from realized British capital. But the African emigrants from the United States to Liberia have not had any such resources at their back. They or their fathers have been slaves; and their only means of reaching Liberia was by the gift of a free passage, with six months free support after arrival, by the Colonization Society which founded this refuge for emancipated slaves on the West Coast of Africa. There have been no African Crusoes to help to build up this African Republic; the wealth, whatever it may be, within her is only the surplus of what her own people have created, over and above what they required for their own support. The progress thus made must necessarily be slow in comparison with that of an English colony anywhere, although it may be, as it has been in reality, rapid when viewed only in connexion with the elements available for promoting it. But we hope and believe that the time is now approaching when that progress will be greatly stimulated. Liberia, formed of American Africans, strongly imbued with the Republican principles so extreme in the American people, is not likely to attract any new elements of wealth and population from any other country than that from which its present civilized population has been derived. Ardently desiring as we do to see a rapid advance in Liberia, we rejoiced when we foresaw, as an inevitable consequence of the civil war in the United States, an increased emigration of emancipated Africans from those states to Liberia. The extreme change in the position of the late slaves in America, who have been so suddenly elevated from a debasing bondage, from a condition in which they were estimated rather as beasts than as men, to the full privileges of citizenship, political as well as social, has, however, retarded that movement toward Africa which would otherwise have impelled large numbers of the emancipated to Liberia. Still, the desire to become citizens of an exclusively African Republic, and that in Africa, has been gradually spreading in America, and the Colonization Society, who sent a shipload of emigrants in November last, and another in May, will despatch their ship again in November next with a further addition of some 800 for the African Republic. From the published statements of the society we have reason to believe that 4,000 or 5,000 emigrants might have been sent to Liberia during the present year, instead of some 1,500, had the society been in possession of the requisite funds. We must express our hope that the Colonization Society will be able to obtain all the money it may require to realize the spontaneous desires of late American slaves to become Liberian citizens. It is only by a large increase in her civilized industrial population that Liberia can make rapid progress in production and wealth. She is limited to this source of increase by the elements of which she is composed, by the nature of her institutions, and the strong peculiarities of her people; and all who are desirous of seeing the West Coast countries and their peoples emerge from their barbarism and degradation and come within the sphere of Christian civilizing influences should assist the Colonization Society of the United States in conveying emigrants to Liberia. We had hoped that before 1870 her civilized population would there be increased to at least 50,000. She could with the assistance rendered by the society for six months after the arrival of the emigrants in Liberia have very well established the requisite number, or even a greater number, within her borders before that period could they have been sent to her; and such an addition to her civilized labourers on her coasts and the rich lands of her navigable rivers would, we are convinced, soon give to the carping libellers of the African race new and forcible evidence of the just claim of the African to the rights and sympathies of a common brotherhood with the hitherto more favoured European.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WAR IN LIBERIA.—DEATH OF THE LATE PRESIDENT, THE HON.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

No foreigner can possess land or houses in Liberia. Consequently, no foreigner can hold land or houses in Liberia as a security for capital advanced.

What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour. For all these accessories, capital realized elsewhere is absolutely necessary. Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets. We are not at all sure that the Liberian authorities have, in the new laws which have been enacted, and which we this month publish, done all that is wanting to induce foreigners with capital to settle among them and undertake the cultivation and improvements that their country so greatly needs; but we feel sure that, having once entered on the right path, as they have now done, they will not be slow in supplementing these new laws by others that may be found to be indispensable for the realization of the important objects they have in view.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization? The Bible contains as good a code for the improvement of mind and manners as any book extant.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of the interest which attaches to the present situation of affairs in West Africa, and the issues which hang upon the campaign undertaken by the Royal Niger Company, it may be well, says *The Times*, to summarise briefly the leading features of the actual position and the steps by which that position has been reached.\n\nIn the first place it is necessary to distinguish between the situation on the coast and that in the interior, and for this purpose it is essential that the geography of the district should be present to the mind. The configuration of the basins of the rivers Niger and Binué as they float to the sea may be represented by the letter Y, of which the tail stands on the Atlantic coast. The distance from the confluence of the rivers to the coast is about 300 miles. The district is traversed from west to east by rising ground from which other rivers running parallel with the main flood of the Lower Niger flow also to the sea. These minor rivers are known under the general name of the Oil Rivers. Their mouths constitute coast ports where African trade has for a very long period been carried on. The names of the seven principal Oil Rivers are Benin, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Quaebo, Opobo, and Old Calabar. The coast district through which they flow to the sea spreads east and west of the mouth of the Lower Niger, and forms one British dependency known as the Niger Coast Protectorate. It stretches from the frontier of Lagos to the Rio del Rey, which is the frontier of the German Cameroons. The mouths of the Niger and the territory lying round and enclosed by the rivers Niger and Binué up to the limits of the British *Hinterland* in the interior, constitute the sphere of influence of the Royal Niger Company, which for purposes of convenience may be spoken of as ""Nigeria."" Thus we get in this portion of British West Africa three separate British dependencies—the colony of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate filling up the space between the French and German frontiers upon the seaboard, with the Royal Niger Company\'s territory of Nigeria spreading Y-shaped into the interior and possessing on the coast only the narrow riverain strip by which it commands access to the sea. The colonies of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate cover together about 3,000 square miles. Nigeria has an extent of about 500,000 square miles. For the administration of affairs upon the coast the Imperial Government is directly responsible. The administration of affairs in the interior is carried on under the charter granted about ten years ago to the Royal Niger Company.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The countries of the Zambezi basin', 'section_title': ""On the eve of the 'Scramble'"", 'content': ""During the first three quarters of the nineteenth century, Central Africa underwent an extensive transformation.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""accumulated from the trade.

In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another.

Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest. It would appear, indeed, that the African dimension theory provides a better rounded, more historically focused theory of the partition than any of the purely Eurocentric theories.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character.

From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia.

In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 339, 'article_title': 'LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': 'We are sorry to learn that the Cavalla River is in a very disturbed state, and that the Liberian Government find it impossible to keep peace among the rival tribes, who are constantly at war with one another.'}, {'id': 773, 'article_title': 'War in the River Gambia.—Rinderpest.', 'full_section_title': 'War in the River Gambia.—Rinderpest.', 'last_edit_date': '12-19-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_01_1866', 'content': ""Affairs in the Upper Rivers have of late been quiet.

In the evening of the 13th, I read a paper on falling stars, and their till now not sufficiently explained frequency at certain times of the year, especially the middle of November, without, however, remembering that it was just the time. After I had slept an hour or so, I was awakened by a cry and a light (it was at one o\'clock a.m. of the 14th), and went out to see the cause of it, when I saw several shining sparks flying through the air. At first, I thought they were glowworms, which are very frequent in the Sierra Leone or Bahama grass we have planted round our place, but they were too large. Then I looked out for a conflagration in the direction where the sparks came from (north-east), and at last I saw that I had tumbled on the very thing I had read of, a shower of flying stars, and called out my people to witness it. It was a beautiful and interesting sight, thousands of flying stars flying through the clear sky, all in the same direction, N.E. to S.W., horizontally, not very high over the earth. Their visible course varied from ten to forty degrees of length; the former only resembling a slight stroke of a match in a dark room, the latter partly attaining a great brightness, far exceeding that of Venus, and gradually dying away, but without any sound. We looked at the phenomenon till about two o\'clock, when it gradually diminished. In the morning I heard that the beginning of it was observed at ten o\'clock, and that some of the people were much frightened. I should like to know whether it was also observed in Europe, and how it was seen. The phenomena in our dark and gloomy political heavens have really got more portentous since I wrote; the roads are still stopped, war seems to be again at hand, nobody moving to avert it and try to make peace, nor any proper preparation, nor unity; on the contrary, the protected tribes do their best to harm each other, to panyare, to quarrel, to cheat, to tear their own bowels and to instigate each other to hatred, jealousy, and mischief. The enemy is nearly openly provided with everything necessary, while they keep the roads shut and will very probably first assault our poor abandoned friends, the Ayigbes or Krepees, and then turn against us, perhaps with our own ammunition and provisions! To-day some runaways from Aquamoo report that there are plenty of Ashantees, and that they have given powder, lead, &c., to the Aquamoos, and that they are preparing themselves for an attack on the Krepees. A missionary and mercantile station is the nearest place towards the river and Aquamoo territory. And here, one day\'s journey from it and five miles from Aquamoo, nothing is doing to prevent it! And all this after the most decided unwillingness on the part of the mass of the people on both sides, as well as the Government, to fight again, and with the most easy way to prevent it, the access to Anglaw and Aquamoo being in the hands of the Government and the ""protected"" tribes! If matters drag on so till war breaks out, I am sure it will be more disastrous for both parties than the first time, and scarcely lead to a better settlement, the country having got into a far worse state than it was then, two of our chiefs dead and not yet replaced, the people intent on making a most shameful and cruel funeral custom, provisions scarce, and the tribes distracted and disturbed.

The reasons are these, Mr. Editor. We the Cape Palmas Town people, the ""Graway,"" and the River Cavalla people, have been in war with the Cavalla and Rocktown people, who took away a piece of land belonging to us on the Cavalla river, which piece of land we had allowed them to plant their rice on, as they had no land to plant upon. The war had been for about seven years, and the last battle we fought was in 1866; since then we never had any actual fight. On the River Cavalla both of us have friends. The Hiddeah people, who are about twenty-five miles from the mouth of the river, are our friends. The ""Tablabo"" people, lower down the river below Hiddeah, are friends to the Cavalla people; so that neither ourselves nor the Cavalla people can go up the river, except we steal by at night. In November, last year, the Tablabo people, who are Cavalla\'s friends, carried war to Hiddeah and killed and wounded four persons. The latter part of January the Hiddeah people carried war to ""Tablabo,"" in return for the war brought to them. When they reached Tablabo Bush-road, going towards the town, they met a man with his war dress on, his war horn, &c. The Hiddeahs asked him in their native tongue who he was; he answered that he was the head war-man (or what we call soldier king) of the Tablabo people. The Hiddeahs fired on him and killed him, after which they returned home, and said, ""We have killed the head war man of Tablabo, our enemy, who brought war against us."" It turned out that this man killed was a Cavalla man, who had gone to Tablabo to assist their friends to fight against the Hiddeahs. The Cavalla people, hearing of the death of this Cavalla man, caught twenty-five of our women and put them in stock; the Rocktown people caught five women and one man, and also put them in stock; these women were passing on the beach going to their daily occupations, when they were caught by the Cavalla people, who said it was us who killed their man. We appealed to the Liberian Government, and the authorities called us and the Hiddeahs, and inquired who of us had killed the man? The Hiddeahs acknowledged they killed the man. The Liberian Government, seeing that we had nothing to do with the death of that man, and that it was done by the Hiddeahs, who were fighting war with the Tablabo, told us they will attend to it, and that in two or three days they would compel the Cavalla people to let our women go. Up to this date three months have passed; our women have not come, but are still in stocks. No doubt the Liberian Government wish to let our women return, but they have no power to enforce it. They are weak and feeble. The Liberian Government make laws, but have no power to enforce them; they speak, but their speech has no effect nor influence whatever.

On this river are several tribes inhabiting both sides of its banks, from the mouth to the falls, which is about one hundred miles; and there is a communication between these and civilised people who trade on the river on a very small scale. There are also several tribes beyond the falls who have little or no communication with the seacoast. Above the falls, on the falls, and a little below the falls, is a tribe called the Webboes, who occupy the right bank of the river for about fourteen miles, and extend a great distance into the bush. It is said that this tribe has from thirty-six to forty towns both in the bush and on the river. On the left bank, opposite the Webboes, is a tribe called the Carboes. Below the Carboe, on the same bank, is a tribe called the Barrawurboes. A little distance below Webbo, on the right bank, is a tribe called the Gerraboes. The Carboes, Barrawurboes, and the Gerraboes are allies, and are in hostilities with the Webboes for a piece of land which they alleged was theirs, and which the Webboes are occupying. This war has existed for many years. Either tribe has always been afraid to pass the towns of the other tribes, except they steal by at night. Some weeks ago about seven Webbo boys came down to the beach. On their return, three were in one canoe and four in another. The canoe containing the three boys passed unseen at night by the Gerraboes and Barrawurboes, though these tribes were on the river watching, as they heard that some Webbo boys were expected up. The other canoe, which had the four boys, as they were about to pass, were hailed by the Barrawurbo people. This was on the night of the 12th inst. The poor Webbo boys got so bewildered that they jumped out of the canoe and ran into the bush. In their attempt to get away one of the boys was caught, and cut so unmercifully across the forehead that his brains protruded. The other three succeeded in hiding themselves in the bush during that night. Early the next morning the Barrawurbo people went in search of them, and unfortunately found two of them. The other boy, who was not found, had been a schoolboy educated at the mission station at Webbo, called Bohlen Station. This school was established by the Right Rev. Bishop Payne, and is connected with the American Protestant Episcopal Church. This boy had left the school for some time; and he himself relates that the Barrawurbo people walked over the place were he had hid himself. When he saw them he said that he prayed to God in his heart as he had been taught by the missionaries, that if God would hide him from his enemies this time he would return to school and be a good boy. God heard this poor boy's prayer and hid him from the eyes of his enemies. After they had gone he made his escape to Beerbo, a tribe below Gerrabo, to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Thornton. Of the three boys who were captured, the one who was cut across the forehead, died during the night, and was cooked and eaten on the morning of the 13th. The other two were cruelly tied both hands and feet. The Barrawurboes invited the Carboes and Gerraboes to come over and help to kill the two remaining boys. They accordingly hastened over with shouting, dancing, beating of drums, and blowing war horns. No entreaties nor cries of the Webbo boys could move the hearts of these heathen tribes. Every man went up to the poor Webbo boys and gave them a chop with his cutlass and laughed at their cries and entreaties; and then they cut off their heads and divided the meat, each tribe taking their portion, cooked it and eat it. They also cooked rice, and put it in the skulls, mixed it up with the brains and eat it out of the skulls, which they say will make them brave in time of war. The Barrawurboes have now determined to prevent all traders from going to Webbo, as they have to pass their towns in going up.

In an interview with a representative of Reuter\'s agency, Dr. Moloney said: ""Although the territories to the west of Nyassa are perfectly peaceful at present, there are certain political conditions that will have to be treated from a diplomatic standpoint. The territory visited by me is divided into two parts—Northern and Southern Angoniland. Although recent operations in Nyassaland have subjugated the Arab slave traders in the Protectorate, there are four chiefs in this territory who will have to be reckoned with in the future. These men are Mpseni, Chekusi, Chewire, and Ongonomo. Three of them exercise certain power within the Protectorate itself. When I left, Major Forbes, who\n**69**\n\nadministers Northern Rhodesia, had not come into contact with these men. As a result of treaties concluded by me, white men can now travel through the country without fear of molestation. With the exception of a German trader, Herr Viese, who represented the Portuguese, no previous traveller has been able to remain in this country. Mr. Joseph Thompson, in visiting Mpseni, had to retreat after a few hours, and Mr. Alfred Sharpe only escaped with his life through Herr Viese\'s intercession. As a result of my negotiations I succeeded in placing under the British flag four big chiefs. Owing to Portuguese influence, Mpseni, although friendly, would not accept the British flag.""'}, {'id': 6809, 'article_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'full_section_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-1', 'issue_date': '04_02_1897', 'content': ""Herbert Jumbo, the Native Chief at Bonny, has recently had disputes with his slaves.

Six of the slaves who had acted as ringleaders in the revolt were seized by the consular guard and forthwith tried. Being found guilty, each was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and to receive forty lashes. Soon afterwards there was another revolt, and the Natives, gathering in large numbers, threatened to wreck the Consulate, the telegraph station, and the European factories. The few Europeans there quickly rallied, and concentrated at the telegraph station. They were besieged all night. The Natives were greatly excited, and kept shouting that they would murder Mr. Harcourt, the Vice-Consul, and Mr. Murray, the District Commissioner.

Captain Blakeney went out sixteen months ago in command of the troops who escorted the French and English Boundary Commissioners. Some serious disturbances had taken place in the interior through the invasion of the British territory by some warlike tribes from the Liberian territory. These tribes were raiding the towns on the British side of the border, and Captain Fairclough was sent against them with a number of the frontier force. The British were completely successful, and defeated the invaders at every point. In the encounters with the invaders five of the frontier troops fell. The enemy lost in killed alone about 150 men.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

The Governor, not feeling satisfied with their reply, and believing that the war was being carried on by a retrograde minority of the people, threatened to bring the Egbas to reason by closing the road to Abbeokuta and preventing all trade between that place and Lagos. Further robberies on traders, and the prospect of an attack by the Dahomians on Abbeokuta, led the Governor to issue a proclamation recommending the Europeans residing there to leave the place, and eventually to carry out his threat of proclaiming a blockade of Abbeokuta; these proceedings were very displeasing to some of the inhabitants of Lagos, and were made the subject of complaint by the Church Missionary Society in England, who addressed a memorial on the subject to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which they urged that immediate measures should be taken for checking the policy of the Governor.\n\nNow, without denying that exception might perhaps be taken to the language and style of the Governor's proclamations and communications to the native chiefs, and admitting that his policy may have been injurious to the Abbeokutan cause, it does not, therefore, follow that it was either improper or injudicious. In an interview with the acting Governor in 1863, the head chief of the Abbeokutans not only admitted that robbery and destruction of property were the natural results of war, but stated that it was their custom, under such circumstances, to destroy trade and property in order to recruit the army, and to drive the people to war, and that if they allowed trading there would be no soldiers. The statement goes far to support the opinion expressed by the Governor that the war was carried on for the satisfaction of a minority, and to justify him in believing that the best way to bring the chiefs to reason would be to stop their supplies from Lagos."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

Wissmann, found extensive districts depopulated and burned by the Arabs in the Kassai and Sankaru regions. Then there has been the attack on the Stanley Falls Station. The wave of reviving Arab power which has been spreading westward from the Zanzibar coast is now, it appears, spreading southward also. The first impulse to this extension is said to date from the end of 1883, when for a time our policy of armed intervention on the coast was changed. Every Arab on the coast appears to have regarded this change as an indication that our opposition to the trade had been abandoned. The recent agreement between Germany and Portugal for the division of the country as far as Nyassa, and the limitation of the Sultan of Zanzibar's influence to a coast-zone ten miles wide, have probably also stimulated the Sultan to endeavour to extend his influence to the west beyond the regions claimed by Germany. Arab camps are being placed at commanding points on the slave-routes, and Arabs visit and settle in the villages of the more powerful of the native chiefs. In short, there appears to be evidence that the disturbances on the Tanganyika and Nyassa, and it may be at Stanley Falls, are not due merely to the turbulence of isolated Arab ivory and slave hunters, but are parts of something like a concerted movement.

So far as Great Britain is concerned it would seem, happily, as if the difficulties were in a fair way towards a satisfactory solution. With the successful close of the military operations which have been found necessary in the Gambia, and the ready acceptance of the terms which were placed before the Jebus, we may hope that a more peaceful future lies before British intercourse, commercial and social, with the Natives, than has been the case during the past few years. But the Germans appear to have considerable trouble before them in the administration of the Cameroons. With the exception of Belgium, Germany stands in the position of being the youngest of the European nations as a Colonial Power. Ten years ago the German Colonial policy had no existence, and the great speed with which the resuscitated German Empire set about the task of founding and developing a Colonial Empire has not been without its visible drawbacks, in the lack of experience in government which has, both in the East and West of the Dark Continent, gone a long way towards damping their ardour in forming a vast Teutonic Empire in Africa. Even more difficult than the task before the Germans is that which confronts the French in West Africa.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

I was able, however, on my journey to and fro along the coast to make some special investigations with regard to the liquor traffic, and in view of the great urgency of this subject at the present time I venture to offer a few observations on this most important subject. The great difficulty at the present time is the unequal competition of the various political divisions into which West Africa is divided. The low duties, for instance, in force in the German possession of Togoland and that of French Dahomey render the protection of the frontier in each case exceedingly difficult, and at any time this unfortunate state of things may lead to international complications. For this reason I would urge in the strongest terms the necessity for immediate action to be taken to secure international agreement, if only that this undoubted cause of friction may be removed, and that there may be agreement between the Powers who have taken possession of tracts of land in Africa. It can hardly be wondered at that Natives of Africa regard the profession of benevolent intentions which have been put forward with much éclat at the Berlin and Brussels Conferences as, to say the least of it, verging on hypocrisy. . . . It has often been suggested that in appealing for action we are opposing the true interests of British trade. On the contrary, it is clear that in seeking for international agreement as to this matter we are really asking for justice to British trade, as it is well known that Great Britain leads the way in the amount of duty levied on alcohol in the British possessions in West Africa, and Mr. Alfred Jones, of Liverpool, who probably has as much interest in West African trade as any other living man, supported this view strongly at the annual meeting of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee at Grosvenor House in May last. . . . It is not true, I am thankful to say, that the whole of our West African dominions are utterly demoralised by the drink traffic. Happily the evidence which I have obtained points unmistakably to the fact that only a small part of the territories under our control has been much affected by the spirit trade, as the difficulties of transport render the carriage of spirits far into the interior a difficult matter; but we have evidence that the area is rapidly increasing. With the opening up of roads and the development of railways, and the greater security of travel, drink is finding its way where it had not penetrated before. Now it is in our power to prevent the evils which are too well known in this as in other countries as arising from spirits.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town. The communication between Niangwe and Stanley Falls by the Congo is almost impossible, owing to the many falls and rapids; and the Lomami will form a further means of extending protection and bringing civilisation to regions which have suffered much from the Arab raids for slaves."", 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African Native Wars', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We shall return to this subject as soon as possible.', 'last_edit_date': '1862-11-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}]",True

The guns were bought with wages earned at the diamond mines, and as such represented an enormous investment in labour. The Sotho also valued their guns because they might be used in future to defend their kingdom, as the long history of their struggle with the Orange Free State had only too clearly taught them. The possession of a gun by a man further signified the passage from childhood to adulthood among the Sotho. The Sotho also suspected that the Cape government did not fully trust them. Besides, the chiefs suspected that the Cape government wanted to weaken them so as to turn them into slaves. There were further measures that drove the Sotho into armed resistance. In 1879 the Cape Colony proposed to alienate the Qluthing district to white farmers as a punishment for its Sotho chief, Moorosi, who had recently rebelled. Such action was in complete violation of the British promises to Moshoeshoe that no part of his country would be alienated. Moreover, the Cape government also announced that the hut tax would be increased to £1. This was utterly unacceptable to the Sotho in view of the recent Cape move to appropriate £12000 from the Lesotho account to the Cape Colony.\nThe Sotho tried to come to an understanding with the Cape Colony by peaceful means. They protested to Sprigg when he twice came over to their country to discuss most of these issues with them; they sent petitions to the governor and the Queen of England; they sent delegates to Cape Town to go and lobby the parliamentarians, but all these efforts came to nothing.\nMeanwhile power in Lesotho shifted from the king, now called Para› mount Chief, Litsie, to the chiefs. The king was getting too old and, though opposed to the disarmament and other Cape colonial measures, was extremely fearful of the adverse effects of an armed resistance that might drive out the British and expose the kingdom to the Orange Free State.\nHe therefore moved out of step with the popular clamour for armed struggle and called for peaceful protests.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

African resistance varied in accordance with the nature of the society and in accordance with how each community perceived the external threat to its sovereignty. '$^{s}$ What differed was the extent or otherwise of resistance. As Ochieng puts it, 'practically everywhere in Kenya the imposition of colonial rule was resisted. Better armed and employing groups of mercenaries, the British imposed their authority only by violence'. 16 On the coast, the Mazrui family resisted the take-over by the IBEAC. This resistance was led by Mbaruk bin Rashid who organized hit-and-run warfare against the superior weapons of the British forces. It took reinforce› ments of Indian troops brought in by the British to defeat him. He fled Tanganyika, only to fall into the hands of the Germans. The Mazrui resistance came about as a result of British attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the coastal societies. After the Mazrui family had settled in Takarungu on the Kenya coast, they had gradually begun to extend their influence to many parts of the coast. They acquired, for example, the monopoly of buying grain from the Mijikenda people along the coast and had thus come to control the sale of food crops on the coast. The monopoly was resisted by the Giriama between 1877 and 1883 when war broke out between the two groups. The Mazrui were defeated. There› after, they had come to some understanding with the Giriama whereupon the two communities became trading partners. The coming of the British interfered with this arrangement as well as the internal organization of the Mazrui society, providing one reason why the Mazrui resisted the imposition of British rule.\nWhen in 1895, the Wali Takarungu died, the IBEAC chose their local friend to succeed him instead of Mbaruk who had a better claim to the throne but was known not to favour the British presence.$^{17}$ It was for this reason that Mbaruk sought to drive the British away from the coast by force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Kenya', 'content': ""African response to all this was, as already indicated, both military and diplomatic, though at times there was withdrawal, non-co-operation or passivity. The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The impact of the Mfecane on the Cape Colony', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony on the eve of the Mfecane', 'content': ""The third reason why the eastern boundary line continued to be a zone of black-white tension and violence was that the two racial groups were pursuing similar economic activities such as, for example, cattle-farming and agriculture, which were staple industries on either side of the frontier.

These developments made it impossible for Cape Nguni to expand north-eastwards.\nBecause they formed the vanguard of the Cape Nguni's westward and southward expansion, the Xhosa automatically bore the brunt of blackwhite conflict on the border. As a result the Xhosa have not only been by far the most written about, they have also been the most abused and the most hated of the Cape Nguni peoples of the region in Cape colonial historiography. 9\nAs already said, the Xhosa, who did not recognize the Fish as a boundary, simply crossed it at will to graze their cattle and sheep. Such boundary 'violations' were sometimes accompanied by cattle-rustling, to which the Cape colonists often responded with organized retaliatory raids into Xhosa areas, arguing that such action was necessary for them to retrieve their property. It was not unusual, however, for the activities of the colonial commandos to exceed the stated objectives.\nIt is clear, therefore, that black-white relationships in the region were not peaceful on the eve of the Mfecane.

The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860. Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""accumulated from the trade. The rivalry for control of trade increased the social disruption and this was further intensified by population move› ments caused by the contemporaneous Nguni (also referred to as Ngoni in some of the literature) invasion. The consequent instability increased the number of people who were ready to follow enterprising leaders. In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state. Even Isike, the successor of Mkasiwa in Unyanyembe, became powerful enough to offer the Arabs and later the Germans a great deal of resistance."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'Coercion, violence and the market', 'content': 'The effects of resistance to the almost insatiable demands of the larger states in the Lakes region in the nineteenth century included the decline of productivity in nearby tributary areas and the consequent shift back to the courts of some of the costs of surplus production of foodstuffs - since more elaborate means had to be evolved to maintain the high levels of tribute from beyond the regular producing areas within the existing domains.

In revenge for this the traders, five years prior to our arrival, had resolved to 'tengeneze' the native (make them behave). For this purpose a combined caravan of some 1,500 men stationed at Kwa-Sundu [later Mumia] was marched upon them. Dividing into sections, they entered the district at different points, and crossed it, devastating every village on the way, killing thousands of men and women, committing the most horrible atrocities, such as ripping up women with child, making great bonfires and throwing children into them, while the small boys and girls were captured as slaves. 20 Most of the other people of the north-central interior of East Africa were less affected by this international trade. They had less direct or even indirect dealings with the foreigners from the coast; in fact in many cases they were unwilling to welcome these foreigners into their societies, although they were willing to sell foodstuffs to caravans on the stopping stations.

This widespread commercial prosperity came to an end with the drop of rubber prices in 1899-1902. 'The problem was intensified after 1899 in Bailundu by the intrusion of European traders ... When rubber prices plummetted, both Portuguese merchants and a new wave of poor whites ... arrived to establish themselves in commerce.'

But they very soon discovered that European demands upon them were equally, if not more, intolerable.

Thus Indian traders were not only allowed, but, to some extent, were also encouraged to patronize trade in East Africa, and to some extent in Central Africa. The Asian population in East Africa increased as follows: Uganda: 1910 - 2000; 1917 - 13026; Tanganyika: 1913 - 18784; 1931 - 23422; Kenya: 1921 - 22800; 1931 26759. The 'dislike and distrust of the Levantine communities' in West Africa, which Professor Bauer noticed to be 'marked in official circles', 71 was a relatively recent development. Real hostility towards the Levantines, mostly Lebanese, came not from official circles but from the various European agents of commercial firms, and such hostility was in response to effective trade rivalry presented by the Levantines.$^{72}$ And where British firms appear to have been given preference, it was not because of their respectability, but because they could - with the blessing of the British government - act as effective pressure groups and influence colonial policy› makers. 73 Still, Ehrlich's generalization that 'administrative attitudes, throughout British Africa, rarely encouraged indigenous commercial initiative'$^{74}$ is quite valid. But other factors stifled local initiatives. First of all, general official policy, as would be expected in a colonial situation, was geared primarily towards the advancement of imperialist interests. Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

However we may regret such a barbarous execution, still it must be admitted that it was done for the good of the public; and if it was unlawfully carried out, it was only because the Government that ought to have done it had long ceased to do its duty in those parts, and had formally withdrawn its protection from them. During the last twelve months the King of Ashantee has expended in Aquamboe alone no less than 1,500 or 2,000 ounces of gold in the purchase of salt, gunpowder, and lead, only.

What for—for aiding the Ashantees? No; but to compel them to pay an iniquitous fine, which has ruined all who ever had anything to do with it. The present phase of this Kroboe business is most disgraceful. We hear that the Government is enforcing the payment of this fine, and even threatens to sell the palm oil tree plantations of the Kroboes to the Aquapems to pay the contractors for the fine, thereby setting one tribe against another, and this at a period when unanimity is required amongst the tribes of the Eastern Districts.\n\nThe Governor called at Accra on the 6th inst., in H.M.S.

N. W. Hewett, K.C.B., V.C., will be shortly held at a rendezvous about 150 miles off the coast, when our line of operations will be decided upon. The undertaking before us is a dangerous one, and it would be foolish to underrate its difficulties. The whole of the delta of the Congo is inhabited by a tribe of rascals called Missionghis, who live almost entirely by pillaging vessels proceeding peaceably up the river. The villages of these fellows are secreted in the midst of deadly mangrove swamps, which can only be approached by narrow mud creeks. During the past four weeks Captain Medlycott, R.N. (H.M.S. Spiteful), and Mr. Hopkins, our consul at St. Paul de Loanda, have been engaged day and night in surveying these creeks, and they are certainly the first Englishmen who have ever ventured so far in. The natives were often heard talking in the bush, but they never discovered the explorers. The result of their exertions is that a correct chart of the whole of the delta has been prepared, and will be laid before the Commodore without delay; he will be enabled to see at a glance how to get at the pirates, and it is to be hoped that he will teach them a sharp lesson. One of their latest acts of piracy was the attack upon and utter destruction of the British three-masted schooner Geraldine, and the murder of four of the unfortunate crew. This took place in January last. The Commodore and Mr. Hopkins went in March to a place called Ponta da Lenha, in the Congo River, convened a meeting of the so-called princes of that place, and desired them to give up the names of the chiefs who had instigated the attack on the Geraldine. They not only refused to give any information, but were most insulting and impertinent in their demeanour. When Mr. Hopkins told them that their conduct would go a long way to show that they were enemies of the Queen, they laughed in his face, and said they cared nothing at all about that. One of their practices is to catch white men and tie them up in their villages, and keep them there till a ransom is paid. When the Consul expostulated on this point with one chief called Capeta, of Macotetla, he threatened to serve the Consul the same if he got the chance. Mr. Hopkins jumped up to seize the ruffian, when his native followers immediately drew their bayonets and attempted to stab the Consul. This took place immediately under the guns of two men-of-war, and in the presence of several officers. I may say that I have had a long experience of West African natives, but these men are the worst I have ever known. It will be necessary, I fear, to punish them severely, as nothing else will curb their insolence. They actually began collecting their forces to attack H.M.'s gun-boat Foam when she went ashore on one of the numerous sand banks of the river, but she fortunately got off without damage as soon as the tide rose. I heard upon good authority that the natives had collected nearly 2,000 canoes, and that they would have fallen upon the ship at midnight. Two days after the Commodore and the Consul had their interviews with the chiefs at Ponta da Lenha they attacked another boat in the river, and stole all the goods it contained. The leaders of these pirates are Manuel Vacca, Ani-Zanzi, and Ani-Quango. It will, perhaps, be in the recollection of your readers that Manuel Vacca was removed from the Congo a few years ago, and left a prisoner in the island of Ascension. By what I cannot but consider an act of mistaken leniency he was allowed to return. He very soon commenced his old practices, and thus many valuable lives have been sacrificed, many cruel tortures practiced, and a great deal of property lost. There are English, French, and Brazilian traders in the Congo, most of whom have established credits with England. It is, in fact, English money that keeps them going, and a very valuable trade is done in ivory, gum, copal, bee's-wax, india-rubber, and palm oil, in exchange for cotton goods, guns, gunpowder, beads, and rum; but unless the depredations of the pirates are checked with a firm hand it is to be feared that the trade will languish and die away.""}, {'id': 3815, 'article_title': 'The Difficulties at the River Scarcies', 'full_section_title': 'The Difficulties at the River Scarcies', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1879#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_08_1879', 'content': 'A correspondent, writing from the West Coast of Africa on July 7, says: ""Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, in his reply to Mr. A.

His total force along the frontier consists of four white inspectors (all English military officers), four native sub-inspectors, and 350 men, with a Maxim gun, a seven-pounder, and rocket-troughs. Of these Captain Lendy has only fifty police with him at Falabah, but detachments have been left at Bafodia and Kimiki. It is expected that the frontier police will be reinforced shortly by the addition of one officer and a hundred men. Even then its number will be few enough for effective combination, as Falabah is 250 miles up country, and in the midst of turbulent tribes. The Merotays, who were defeated at Pambi a year ago, when Captain Lendy won his D.S.O., are in arms again, and have assembled at a town called Yana, are attempting to spoil his line of communication with Freetown. Intent upon that object they attacked Fafodia a few days ago, but were driven off, leaving thirty-three men dead on the field, while seventy-two prisoners fell into the hands of the Bafodia people, whose total losses were four killed and nine wounded. The Merotays, however, were not disheartened. Quite recently they attacked and captured another town close by, named Kadanou, and there they have erected a stockade to serve as a base from which they will probably attack Bafodia again, as the two places are a very short distance apart. Meanwhile fighting has been going on also at Kimiki, where parties of the Sierra Leone frontier police are stationed. Except the town which they hold, all Kimiki has been destroyed by Sofas, Kurankos, Connors, and Mendis, who have banded together for the purpose of attacking our friendlies. Captain Lendy's\n\nposition is thus rendered dangerous, and in a country so devastated by war he finds difficulty in getting a sufficiency of food even for his small force. He has advised that an expedition shall be sent up to punish the offending tribes, but the Colonial Government is always slow to quell disturbances of this kind. If Captain Lendy's force now at Falabah should have to fall back, it must skirt the area of war at Kimiki in order to reach Freetown, and that would involve camping four days or more in the open, a prospect far from pleasant since the rains begun, and, with the chances of being harassed day and night by hostile natives.

Ever since the deportation of Ja-Ja, four or five chiefs, under the leadership of Kukiagam have obstructed traders passing their territory. The trouble occurred at Opobo, near Bonny river, and, notwithstanding the presence in the river of H.M.S. Bramble since September last, the chiefs have thrown a boom across the river to oppose the passage of steamboats belonging to the traders. The cause of their defiant action is easily understood. They occupy a commanding position in the river, and being possessed of thousands of men and arms to man their canoes, they are a dangerous enemy. Originally the traders purchased the produce of the interior entirely from them, but of late years have sent their steamboats higher up the river to buy at first cost. Hence their determination to prevent the traders passing through their territory. Major Macdonald, who had been sent from England as Commissioner, arrived off Opobo in the Pheasant, on March 3, immediately after the arrival of Admiral Wells in the Raleigh. The Bramble came out of the river to join the flag, and next morning was under weigh, the Admiral shifted his flag to the Pheasant, and, with the Commissioner, proceeded up the river, where they were met by Consul Hewett, from Bonny. This place is in telegraphic communication with England, so that on March 11 the Admiral, with the sanction of the Admiralty, was able to hold a grand palaver, which was attended by the Commissioner, the Consul, the leading traders, and the turbulent chiefs. Hundreds of natives came with their chiefs, and the Pheasant was anchored off the place with her guns loaded and the ship cleared for action. The chiefs were fined 300 puncheons of oil, were ordered to deliver up their guns and war-canoes, and to deposit £1,000 as security for good behaviour. On the following evening the Admiral signalled by electric light that the Bramble was to be sent for him, the Pheasant remaining up the river until the arrival of the Brisk, with Commander Winsloe. On Thursday, the 14th, the Admiral shifted his flag to the Bramble, and again, on coming out of the river, to the Raleigh, when the Bramble was ordered to proceed to Fernando Po, and then, by way of Saint Thomé and Ascension, to the Cape.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-05-06', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_05_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Letter of Chiefs of Sherbro' to Governor Rowe"", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—We, the undersigned Chiefs in the Big Boom River and adjacent countries, beg most respectfully to state for the information of his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief the following facts.\n\nFor some time past, and up to the present, this river and its neighbourhood have been in an agitated state, consequent upon the fixed determination of the Bompeh people to destroy Ticonco and afterwards to cross the river and make war, if possible, upon the Lubus.\n\nThe instigator of all this mischief is the notorious Cannagbo, who by his duplicity successfully evaded the British Government and re-entered the country, from which he had with much trouble been expelled. Since this man's return a continual disturbance has been kept up; order has been overthrown, the authority of the Government defied, and a fatal blow given to the industries of the country. Hence it is that the great dullness of trade is everywhere complained of in the river, for the constant kidnapping by the Bompeh people, headed by Cannagbo, of the Ticonco people and other tribes from the interior on their way to the river-side with commercial products, has dealt a death-blow to trade, and cannot fail to affect materially and directly the revenue of Her Majesty's Government. Even now, notwithstanding the actual presence of his Excellency at his seat of government, a fresh plot is being entered into by the same Bompeh people for the invasion of Gberry's territory at the very first favourable moment,—and how soon that moment may arrive we have no means of knowing; we apprehend, however that the dry season only is awaited to enable the disturbers of the peace to carry out their mischievous plans.\n\nAs Chiefs in treaty with Her Majesty's Government, we deem it our imperative duty to bring these facts under the notice of his Excellency at an early time, and not delay until the calamity,\n\nhas actually fallen upon the land.

The inhabitants of Danoe have been already punished for their share in the affair, the town having been attacked and the natives driven out of it."" Here we have the old course being pursued—bloodshed, and more bloodshed—to enforce upon people not under British law a two shillings-and-sixpence per gallon duty on spirits, and other Customs\' duties of the Gold Coast Colony. Do not such conflicts and subsequent reprisals, or punishment, as it is here called, support our argument of the absolute necessity of the incorporation of the remaining Coast districts into the Gold Coast Colony—an incorporation earnestly prayed for by the importing traders in those districts? To all who know what those districts are, and the character of their people—notorious wreckers of every unfortunate vessel coming to grief in their waters—nothing could be more absurd than to qualify the annexation and bringing them under British law as an iniquity, or a gratification of the Imperial thirst for territory, which thirst we have already repudiated, and which the British Government has been far from evincing in that part of the world. Conflicts such as are shadowed forth in the paragraph we have here copied into our columns must and will continue while a two-and-sixpenny duty on spirits, and an equally onerous duty on tobacco, two imports in the greatest request, continue to be levied on a portion of that small line of coast, while the importation is free on the remaining small portion, except as regards certain small payments to the native chiefs, who, in the event of annexation, could be equitably remunerated. Our aim has ever been the civilization of the people of West Africa. None stand more in need of it than the Coast people of whom we are writing; and we do not hesitate to affirm there is little, if any, hope of their making any progress in civilization, which there means the suppression of a host of iniquities degrading to humanity, unless they be incorporated as above suggested.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position. The trade of the district was gradually passing into the hands of the French, from the want of activity and determination on the part of the British authorities.

Such a man, we hope, will see the necessity of something more than to be content that no invasion has taken place, or that it has been repulsed. It is not compatible with the dignity of the British Government, or with the duty of the latter to the countries under its protection, that the latter should remain liable to a repetition of the “Golden Axe” insult whenever it may suit a vain and ignorant barbarian to inflict it. Sir Samuel Rowe will, we hope, recognize the necessity, and make that necessity to be fully comprehended in Downing-street, that a definite line of policy must be adopted, and certain efficient measures be taken and maintained, as regards Ashanti and the other native States beyond the River Prah such as shall put an end for ever to the possibility of the recurrence of insulting threats, with their disturbing influence on industrial pursuits in the countries of the protectorate, and needless expense both to the Imperial and Colonial Exchequer. To give security to a country as well as to preserve peace and order in it, is one of the first duties of a sovereign power. This security the British Government must now give to the Fantee countries. We have made them dependent on us for protection, and we must make that protection efficient—not spasmodic, according to the varying humour of an insolent neighbouring barbarian, but constant and assured beyond the possibility of doubt. If it be said that the British Parliament, uninstructed by the fate of Old Rome, would not consent to any charge on the British Exchequer for any requisite measurer, then we say that the revenues of the protected territories, now not less than 100,000l. a year, are adequate for securing the interest on a public loan for the small amount that would be required. We have before contended that this revenue should be made available for guaranteeing railroads, and for other works of public improvement, that may aid in the development of the natural resources, vegetable and mineral, of those territories; but though we have the construction of railways there deeply at heart, we would postpone these and all other aids to industry in favour of that one great first aid without which all others are liable to fail in their object—security, perfect security, for life and property against the threat of barbarian invasion. We venture to hope that Sir Samuel Rowe will be the instrument through whom this great aid will be obtained. For ages past Ashanti has been the curse of all neighbouring countries. It was delivered into our hands in 1873-4 for destruction, and we failed in our duty, allowed it to be revived, and again to become insolent, and are now suffering the temporary disturbance of important industries, and compelled to incur considerable expense, because of that insolence.

These obstacles to an increase of trade were being most ably and successfully dealt with by Captain Gallwey, an officer whose energy and tact in dealing with the natives was beyond all praise. Captain Gallwey had recently effected a treaty with the King of Benin, a potentate who hitherto refused all efforts in this direction. As to the districts of Brass and Warree, which marched with the Niger territories on the east and west, the chiefs of Brass were a difficult factor to deal with; they had many grievances, some real and some imaginary. Captain MacDonald, in charge of this district, had had a troublesome task to perform in dealing with them—a task he had carried out with much tact and skill. (Cheers.) A force of Mohammedan troops, 250 in number, had been raised—fully armed, drilled, and equipped—while barracks had been provided for them at Old Calabar. Fresh enlistments were taking place, but the supply of recruits was limited, owing to the demand for men in the West African colonies from whose territories the recruits were enlisted. The general plan, which was based on lines laid down in the Brussels Act, was to establish fortified posts at certain distances in the interior, to form between them lateral communications by means of roads well kept and guarded, and then to advance another parallel, leaving nothing unfinished or unguarded behind, and by such means to bring the whole of the ground covered under the influence of civilisation and Christianity. (Loud cheers.) But that was not so easy a task. By far the greater part of the native population were steeped in practices which were abhorrent. He alluded to human sacrifice, cannibalism, the slaughter of twins, and slave-raiding, with all its attendant horrors. To do away with these without setting the country in a blaze would require time, immense patience, and an intimate knowledge of the native character. Above all things with the African natives, they should be just; they should say what they were going to do and do it. (Cheers.) They should be gentle, but just and firm, and, above all, let the native feel that if he did wrong there was an iron hand of justice, backed by the law and power of England, but tempered by its mercy, from which in the long run there was no escape.

In reaction, the British offered to station a British Resident at Kumasi in return for the payment of annual stipends to the Asantehene and his other leading kings. Not only did the Asantehene reject this offer but dispatched a high-powered mission to the Queen of England 'to lay before your Majesty divers matters affecting the good estate of our kingdom'.$^{43}$ This diplomatic mission left Kumasi in November 1894 attended by over three hundred retainers. It entered Cape Coast on 10 December and left for England on 3 April 1895. Not only did the British government refuse to see the Asante mission but, while it was still there, instructed the governor on the coast to issue an ultimatum to the Asantehene to receive a British Resident and pay the war indemnity of 50000 oz of gold imposed on Asante in 1874. Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection. In spite of this, Prempeh, his mother who was also then the Queen, his uncles and some of the war chiefs were arrested and deported first to Sierra Leone and thence to the Seychelles Islands in 1900. 44 (See Plate 6.2.)"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': 'Although short-lived, the Fante Confederation was of great significance.

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': 'In the eighteenth century the Asante dynasties carved a vast empire for themselves in the heart of the forest and south of the Black Volta river bend.$^{1}$ Thanks to Osei Tutu, the founder, Opoku Ware and Osei Kodjo, this kingdom was highly integrated, with its nucleus around Kumasi and the Golden Stool (sikadwa). It wielded undisputed economic and political power over the coast and over the dependent kingdoms to the north. Towards the centre, kingdoms associated with the Oyoko clan from Kumasi gradually became subjugated and tributary on account of structural reforms carried out by Osei Kodjo, first, in the kingdom of Kumasi, and then at the expense of the neighbouring Akan kingdoms: Mampong, Nsuta, Dwaben, Bekwai, Kokofu, Bono, as also Denkyira, Ahafo, Sefwi, Adansi, etc. In this region, the Kumasihene (king of Kumasi) became the Asantehene. From this base, the Asante dynasty held political and economic sway over the coastal kingdoms (Wassa, Nzima, Twifu, Akwamu, Akyem, Akuapem, Ga and Adangbe), and more especially the coastal strip of the Fante chief› taincies. Similarly, to the north, the kingdoms of Gyaman, Gonja, Dagomba and Mamprusi came under the sway of Asante, sanctioned by a yearly tribute (ayibuade) of two thousand slaves, especially after the 1794 treaty.\nThe nineteenth century was to start with the reign of one of the greatest of the Asantehenes, Osei Bonsu (1801-24), whose victorious armies pushed through to the coast in a series of campaigns (1807, 1811 and 1814). The British, who at the time were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and had no clear policy for their Gold Coast settlements, could not but recognize, through the President of the Council of Merchants, Colonel Torrane, and his successors, the reality of the suzerainty, or even sovereignty, of Asante over all the coastal peoples.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""The third category of states included geographically and culturally distant peoples such as the Dagomba, the Mamprusi and the Gonja. They were viewed by the Asante authorities primarily as having to contribute to the economic development of the metropolis. These non-Akan states to the north were subjected to military and political control because of their economic resources. They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo).

Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

The iniquity of Ashanti has overflowed towards the Coast. Without provocation, in search of plunder, victims for its atrocious sacrifices, and permanent dominion if possible, it has flooded into the Protected Territories, and overrun a considerable portion of them. It would not have done this, or even attempted it, had the roads we have so long asked for been made, and had the Fanti Confederation been accepted and utilized by the local Government. Having attempted it, it might have been driven back at the outset, but that we had an evil policy and inefficient authority. We thus delivered up the whole country, until within five or six miles of the Cape Coast Castle, to the enemy. Bearded at last in our dens on the Coast, we had no alternative but to fight. Thus it is we have an Ashanti War. It will cost money, of course; and unhappily, we fear, many valuable lives. It is possible there is some excess of preparation going on, but this is an error in the right direction, if there be error at all in it; because the season during which alone active warfare is possible is rather a brief one for the campaign, which is evidently contemplated to extend to a distance of nearly 200 miles. Government has been loudly called on, and in this instance we think unfairly, to explain what they intend to do, and what is the limit of their views and purposes. This could at best be only answered in general terms, which we suppose would be, ""to clear the Protected Territories of the enemy, and inflict on them such a chastisement as would prevent their rendering it necessary for us to repeat the lesson."" Nothing can be more clear than that we cannot stop short of this result. We must draw the teeth and cut the claws effectually this time. Ashanti is a ferocious, stealthy, and treacherous wild beast. As such she must be treated, even if we have to follow her to her lair at Kumassie. It is not at all certain that we shall have to do this. It is possible that her associate beasts may spring upon and destroy her at our approach. But whether this happen, or whether we have to force her lair, we hold it to be quite impossible for either Her Majesty\'s Government or their Commander in the operations, to decide at this time what must then follow. That must manifestly depend on circumstances. The present Emperor of Germany did not intend, when his army crossed the Rhine, to annex Alsace and Lorraine; or demand two hundred million sterling from the vanquished. Those results grew out of the military operations. When our forces cross the Prah, it will be to repel aggression, and, if possible, to provide against future aggressions, and we must accept the contingencies which after-events may lead to. Sir Charles Adderley says, ""If the Conservatives had been in power the last six months, there would have been no Ashanti War."" This is absurd. It was the policy of Sir C. Adderley\'s Committee that distinctly led up to this war; and we certainly have not found Conservative-appointed Governors on the Coast, one whit more capable than Liberal-appointed ones. Then Lord Derby hopes that ""no visionary ideas of a vast tropical empire in Africa—no exaggerated fancies as to its being our duty to put a coat of moral whitewash on every black man we come across—will lead us to extend still further our Protectorate."" We do not know what our great philosophical statesman means by the ""coat of moral whitewash."" If he means such a result as has been obtained in the Protected Territories by and through our influence—namely, the putting an end for many years to human sacrifices—if he means this, we confess we, at least, do entertain such visionary ideas. But as regards a vast tropical empire, without entertaining any visionary ideas, we do not deem this to be a more impossible result than was Alsace and Lorraine, and the two hundred millions, as the result of the Franco-German War. The great question with our public men in the present age is certain to be, ""Will it pay?"" If it should be proved that ""a vast tropical empire"" would pay, we shall no doubt see it commenced, and gradually established. As regards this question of ""pay,"" Sir Chas. Adderley lays it down as certain that even if we are successful (in the war), the result will be valueless."" Here, as in our remarks on Lord Derby\'s speech, we must revert to the subject of human sacrifices, and affirm that if our operations should so cripple Ashanti, that the vast population beyond, in the interior, which now pay to her the constant heavy tribute of human victims for her horrible human sacrifices, should be freed from that tribute, the result will not have been valueless for a nation that still desires to be called a Christian one. But here we may further express the hope, that if our occupation of Kumassie be only a fugitive one, it will be valuable, and not valueless, in results. It will be so if it lead to a way being opened by which the populations beyond Ashanti may be supplied with arms for their defence against the Ashantis in their victim hunts. It would be a great stroke of policy to effect this, But we suppose Sir C. Adderley meant that, in a pecuniary and commercial point of view, the ""results would be valueless."" This brings us again to the question, ""Will it pay?"" Now it should never be for one moment forgotten that Ashanti and neighbouring territories, and the Kong Mountain range beyond, constitute, probably, with the Protected Territories, one of the richest gold-fields in the world.

The address from which this extract is taken, is one of great power and intense interest, shadowing forth, as it does, changes of extreme importance to the whole British community, and which must influence materially the future destinies of the country. Nor have we any fault to find with the above observations relative to the Ashanti War, except in the paragraphs as to ""the establishment of friendship with the Ashantees,"" and ""the duty of avoiding in future the first entrance into equivocal and entangling engagements."" The latter is a fine phrase, meaning nothing, and copied out of Mr. Bright\'s textbook—a bad volume for a Minister to study as regards foreign relations. Should equivocal and entangling engagements appear to be necessary in the future, for forwarding some great object of Imperial policy, they will be entered into then as they have been entered into in the past. One unacquainted with the history of our connection with the Gold Coast countries, would imagine that, by some act of official stupidity, we had recently entered into engagements which had led to this Ashanti War. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Our engagements with the Gold Coast at this time—those engagements which have forced us into the present Ashanti War—are the unavoidable legacy of the foreign slave trade we ruthlessly carried on there for more than a century, and the efforts since made by the conscience-stricken British nation to put a final end to that abominable traffic. We were thus naturally led to, and detained on, the Gold Coast. We could not remain there without being supreme, and asserting and exercising our supremacy. In the exercise of this supremacy, we became naturally the protectors of the Gold Coast against enemies by sea or land. We consequently took upon ourselves the direction of its external relations, among the chief of which were those with Ashanti; and if there is now a war between us and Ashanti, that war is not the result of Fantee action, nor of ""our having entered into equivocal engagements,"" but of a culpable neglect and mismanagement on our part, the responsibility for which does not attach to the present Administration alone, but to many successive Administrations, which have chosen to shut their eyes to, and take no efficient measures to prevent, results which every unofficial person connected with those countries could foresee. Then, as regards friendship with Ashanti, as a result of the present advance on Kumasi. Should the Ashanti power survive the victory which we are bound to obtain over it at whatever cost, there could not be any friendship between it and us, except by a total change in its principles, customs, and character. Kumasi is a charnel-house, a slaughter-pen, where the blood of innocent human victims is incessantly flowing. Hitherto we have not been responsible for this, save that by a national effort, such as Ashanti has now forced upon us, we might have put an end to it. But if we entered into relations with it (after having conquered it) that would re-establish and perpetuate it, we should be responsible, and guilty as a nation, before God and man. Friendship between light and darkness is not less impossible than friendship, under such circumstances, between Christian Britain and the Ashanti which has been known of up to this present time. But our own opinion, expressed at the commencement of the present operations, and which we still retain, is that there will not be any danger of our falling into such a snare of guilty complicity with a murderous superstition, because the Ashanti power, losing all its prestige by our successful advance on Kumasi, will fall in pieces. It has only existed hitherto through the mutual jealousies of divers people, whom it has played one against another, while using them all for its aggressive operations. We may be mistaken; but this, we repeat, is our confirmed opinion; and it will be well for the Administration of which Mr. Gladstone is the head that this contingency should be maturely considered, in order that they may be able to deal in the most advantageous manner with the emergency should it arise.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PARLIAMENTARY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Earl of Lauderdale directed attention to a statement that British territory had been invaded, though it was a comfort to know that in this case the invader was neither France, nor Germany, nor Austria, nor Russia, but the King of Ashanti, and the territory invaded was a portion of our West African possessions in the neighbourhood of Cape Coast Castle.

He considered that the King of Ashanti was quite right in the view which he took of the matter, as he was practically barred from communication with the Coast. He characterized the course of the Government immediately after the transfer as a mistake which was likely to cost a couple of millions, besides many lives. He did not, however, think the English would be justified in abandoning the post, but thought the position gained by the English at the end of the present hostilities, if they are successful, would be beneficial, inasmuch as the whole Protectorate would be under one flag. Still, he preferred retiring from the Gold Coast to continuing the course of protecting a system of pillage and persecution. Had a proper policy been pursued, the English might have had a valuable ally in the King of Ashanti, instead of spending a couple of millions, besides lives, in fighting him.

Of course, an Ashanti war would not be anything like as large an undertaking as the expedition of twenty years ago: many who then fought against the British are now living quietly under their protection.\n\nIt appears that the King of Coomassie is alleged to have violated treaty engagements with Great Britain by the continuation of the practice of human sacrifices, as well as by hampering trade and attacking neighbouring tribes which are under British protection. There are other causes of complaint, one of which is the difficulty he has placed in the way of the appointment of a British Resident at Coomassie. Communications on these subjects have for some time been taking place between the King of Coomassie and the Governor of the Gold Coast.

Two or three weeks before the prorogation they stated in the House of Commons that an opportunity should certainly be afforded for discussing this question. No day being fixed, Sir Charles Adderley gave notice that he should call the attention of the House of Commons to it on Thursday, the 31st July; but he was prevented so doing by Government allowing the sitting of the House to terminate abruptly at nine o'clock by a count-out. On Monday, the 4th August, a question was asked, as reported in our Parliamentary notice, and there the matter ended for the Session, Parliament being prorogued on the following day. We do not very greatly regret the non-fulfilment of Sir Charles Adderley's intention. All that we hoped from it was, that it might elicit a distinct statement on the part of Her Majesty's Government as to what they purposed to do, and how they intended to effect it; and what we were justified to infer from the studious avoidance of the discussion was, that they had not any fully determined plan that would bear discussion, and wished to keep themselves unfettered by engagements and promises. In this they fully succeeded. No sooner, however, had Parliament been prorogued than a part of their intended plan of operation was made known; and we were informed that Captain Glover, formerly Administrator at Lagos (and who exercised so disastrous an influence as regards the relations of that settlement with the neighbouring interior people), had been appointed to a special command on the Gold Coast, for organizing a body of some six or seven thousand natives for operations against the Ashantis; and that the Houssas were to form the nucleus of his force. This seems to have satisfied the amateur war critics of the daily press, who arrived immediately at the conclusion that the war will thus be promptly terminated. Magnifying exceedingly Captain Glover's merits as regards the Houssas, they argue that as he organized them, so will he organize a body of natives of the Gold Coast, and by them effect the desired object of ridding the country of the Ashanti invaders. We can only express the hope that these expectations will not be disappointed. We believe that Captain Glover can find men of the protected territories quite equal in bravery with the Mahometan Houssas. An essential difference must, however, be borne in mind; he cannot have over any of the Gold Coast natives the same absolute command that he has had over the Houssas, or exact from them the same unlimited obedience. Captain Glover, a great admirer of Mahometanism and the African Mahometans, had, when in the Niger countries, formed a friendship with King Massaba, the Mahometan Houssa Sovereign at Egga. Installed at Lagos as Administrator, and having entered on a course of policy as regards the neighbouring native tribes which could not fail to bring him into constant disputes and disagreements with them, he thought it advisable to surround himself with a force under the name of armed police, which he might use against them in case of need. With this object, he applied to his old friend, King Massaba, for men, and he sent him down a number of his picked Houssa slaves, who gave to the friend of their master the same fealty as to him. These men, brought under a loose sort of discipline, and instructed in the use of the Snider, were reinforced by others from the same source.

Such a man, we hope, will see the necessity of something more than to be content that no invasion has taken place, or that it has been repulsed. It is not compatible with the dignity of the British Government, or with the duty of the latter to the countries under its protection, that the latter should remain liable to a repetition of the “Golden Axe” insult whenever it may suit a vain and ignorant barbarian to inflict it. Sir Samuel Rowe will, we hope, recognize the necessity, and make that necessity to be fully comprehended in Downing-street, that a definite line of policy must be adopted, and certain efficient measures be taken and maintained, as regards Ashanti and the other native States beyond the River Prah such as shall put an end for ever to the possibility of the recurrence of insulting threats, with their disturbing influence on industrial pursuits in the countries of the protectorate, and needless expense both to the Imperial and Colonial Exchequer. To give security to a country as well as to preserve peace and order in it, is one of the first duties of a sovereign power. This security the British Government must now give to the Fantee countries. We have made them dependent on us for protection, and we must make that protection efficient—not spasmodic, according to the varying humour of an insolent neighbouring barbarian, but constant and assured beyond the possibility of doubt. If it be said that the British Parliament, uninstructed by the fate of Old Rome, would not consent to any charge on the British Exchequer for any requisite measurer, then we say that the revenues of the protected territories, now not less than 100,000l. a year, are adequate for securing the interest on a public loan for the small amount that would be required. We have before contended that this revenue should be made available for guaranteeing railroads, and for other works of public improvement, that may aid in the development of the natural resources, vegetable and mineral, of those territories; but though we have the construction of railways there deeply at heart, we would postpone these and all other aids to industry in favour of that one great first aid without which all others are liable to fail in their object—security, perfect security, for life and property against the threat of barbarian invasion. We venture to hope that Sir Samuel Rowe will be the instrument through whom this great aid will be obtained. For ages past Ashanti has been the curse of all neighbouring countries. It was delivered into our hands in 1873-4 for destruction, and we failed in our duty, allowed it to be revived, and again to become insolent, and are now suffering the temporary disturbance of important industries, and compelled to incur considerable expense, because of that insolence.

It appeared to them to be a great pity that our Government should have retired as they did in 1872 without doing anything for the development of the trade there. It was most important for the development of trade and the civilisation of the Natives that we should remain in the country and administer it along with the Gold Coast Colony. We had the French on one side and Germany on the other. He did not want to remark on the administration of either of these countries, but he wished to point out in regard to the hinterland that two or three years ago an expedition, strongly supported by that Chamber, practically annexed the hinterland of Lagos, and since then trade had enormously increased. A new industry in rubber had been started, which promised to attain large dimensions, and the interior was now under an administration of such a character as secured the lives and property of the Natives. They wanted the same thing to be done in connexion with the hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony, and not merely a resident in Coomassie to see that justice was administered in Ashanti.\n\nMr. A. L.

Nothing could be more ridiculous than the way in which we had dealt with Ashanti in the past. Twenty years ago we sent an expedition there, on which we spent nearly one million sterling, and then we went away and left the place. Now that Mr. Chamberlain was giving attention to British interests in various parts of the world, the present was a very opportune time to press forward the question of the annexation of Ashanti. He knew from a number of officials that such a step was most desirable. These officials held the opinion that the place must absolutely be annexed before they could do any good. The country behind the Gold Coast was a very valuable one, but at present there was no protection for anyone to trade there. He believed we would be conferring a great blessing upon the people of Ashanti if we annexed that country. They had seen what could be done in these regions in the way of developing trade by what had taken place in the hinterland of Lagos, and he was sure they would have exactly the same result in the hinterland of the Gold Coast if we had Ashanti freed from the Native rule, which was interested in every way in keeping down the people.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-01-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_02_1896#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ASHANTI INVASION—THE FIRST BATTLE—3,000 KILLED AND WOUNDED.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '19.

In a few months another expedition was got together, but no decisive result was attained. Encouraged by this the Ashantees came down and menaced Cape Coast itself, and were only driven off by a force landed from a gunboat. Smarting under their lost domination of the Fanti settlements, the Ashantees set about forming such a confederation of tribes as would enable them to defy British rule. The plot was discovered, and in 1863 Governor Pine refused further communication with the King until he withdrew his troops from the territory of the protected States and made reparation for the wrongs he had committed. Reporting to the Government at the time, he said: ""As the case now stands, the most I can hope is to drive the Ashantees from the Protectorate without the chance of administering that chastisement or demanding that retribution which is so justly due to its inhabitants—and remain in constant dread of subsequent incursions of a powerful enemy.""

Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy.

Between 1918 and 1920, for example, the prices of such basic staples as rice, beans, potatoes, and soap had doubled and in the latter year a kilogram of rice cost three cents - equal to the average daily salary of most port workers. 95 The strikes at the port followed a broad pattern.

Why should this be allowed? Why restrict us here from attending to our own concerns? With our revenue we could build two or three forts in Ikorodu, Ofin, and Iperu, to protect and keep open that notable road through which Lagos can maintain an extensive trade with the interior. Twenty or thirty Houssas in each fort, properly managed, will keep the road open indeed, therefore great events hanging on small things will surely come to pass! Ah! we shall then ""flourish as the palm-tree."" Believe me, it is reported that the Governor of Lagos was sending his staff (I mean messenger staff) to Ibadan, and the Jebus of Iperu had the unheard-of impudence to send it back! **A new thing in Aku-dom!** This, with a display of a little spirit, will soon be put a stop to, so that it be not repeated in future; but what is our Governor to do?

From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes. If he can be restrained, both humanity and commerce will gain greatly by it.""', 'last_edit_date': '1892-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

I have recently returned from another visit to West Africa, during which I have again been to Abeokuta. At present the authorities there have no intention to grant any favour to the prejudice of British interests; but I think something more should be done to attach the natives of the interior to our Government. Whether deserved or not we have a reputation of being slow and supine. The Egbas (the people of Abeokuta) are sometimes tempted to act unpleasantly towards us. There is a disaffected section in the community, by whom the loyal chiefs are occasionally harassed. On the occasion of my last visit to Abeokuta, last April, intelligence had arrived respecting the Dahomian attack on Porto Novo. It was currently reported that the English had secretly connived with the Dahomians, and an attempt was made to raise an ante-English demonstration. On April 7 important deliberations were conducted by the authorities. Ebullitions of anger were here and there displayed, and an attack was expected. However, the cloud passed off, and the ground of this suspicion appeared to be that an influential Dahomian prince had been for some weeks residing in Lagos. On this occasion I was returning from a tour through the Yaruba country. The region through which I travelled was in a state of great unrest. At Jubu Ode the King and chiefs expressed their vexation over the interminable Ibadan and Ilorin, which are sadly interfering with trade. The Ibadans, while prolonging their strife with Ilorin, are also troubled with the Egbas raiding their farms. The relations between Ibadan and Oyo are in a condition of extreme tension. At Ogbomosho complaints were loud on account of the spoliation of their farms by the Ilorians, with kidnapping and occasional slaughter. Within the last few years thirteen Yaruba towns have been destroyed by the Dahomians, and seven towns were destroyed last year. From what I can gather these towns have about 4,000 inhabitants, while several were much larger. In my journey I passed through the ruins of some of the towns which, a few years ago, were large and influential centres of population and commerce, notably Ijayi and Biolorun Pellu. It would be an unspeakable mercy if some benevolent civilised Power could interfere to cause the chronic strife to cease, and develop the riches of the country. After getting some fifty or sixty miles from the coast the country is comparatively healthy and fertile, as the plantations of cotton, indigo, &c., show, and in some parts rich in mineral treasure. I saw several iron pits and smelting furnaces, and have specimens of iron ore by me. I availed myself of the opportunities afforded me in interviews with kings and chiefs to urge on them the necessity of peace and industry, and was received with welcome wherever I went in the Yaruba country. The reply of one chief was remarkable. He said, “You tell us how much we should be advantaged if we would abandon our quarrels and unite for strength and prosperity. Your words are true; but we are like children fighting. Each is ashamed to be the first to stop, but both wish for nothing better than for some strong man to step between us and send us away to do something wiser.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

During the past fifteen years its northern frontier had been constantly harassed by the inroads of the Mohammedans, who had made Ilorin their centre of operations towards the south, and by that renewed pressure from the north the inhabitants of Yoruba had not only been cut off from their former sources of supplies in that direction, but had also been forced to submit to the exactions and commercial blockade of their weaker kinsmen who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Gulf lagoons. These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands. Not only did they by this means endanger the safety of their own land, and diminish a trade which should be a source of prosperity to all, but they disregarded all former promises and friendly relations with the English, and inflicted a serious injury to our trade, by cutting us off from commercial intercourse with the most important market of West Africa. The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago. And the French Ministry knows little more about it than the rest of the world. The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast.

Now it is to be hoped that they will no longer stand in the way of the development of that part of Africa.\n\nOn June 11, we received from Lagos full details of the fighting which took place between the British troops and the Jebu Army, numbering over 10,000 men. After stubborn resistance at Kapashida, where the Government interpreter, Mr. A. C. Willoughby, was shot through the head, and Captain Hardinge received a wound in the thigh, the Jebus fled, leaving the towns of Eredo, Ayo, and Agushi in the hands of the British. The great battle was fought at Magbon. Captain Hardinge's wound was fortunately slight, and he kept leading his men. The Jebu Army was found to be strongly posted in the rear of the Oshun River, which was overshadowed by a dense forest. They were about 7,000 to 10,000 strong, and were well supplied with arms and ammunition. The British force had to pass through a ravine, in single file, with but a few inches footing. On each side was a thick wood, in which the Jebus were posted, and from which they poured out a continuous and heavy fire. The passage was so intricate that as the men fell, either killed or wounded, they had to be lifted out and placed on one side to allow the others of the force to pass. As soon as the British force reached the open, however, the Jebus had to fly with great loss. Now came the most difficult part of the operations. The enemy were on the opposite bank of the river. The native troops hesitated to go into the water in the face of such a hot fire as the Jebus were keeping up.

When the troops reached the opposite bank the Jebus could not stand their withering fire. At the end of two hours the Jebu army was completely defeated, and the King was taken prisoner to Lagos.

They occupy a commanding position in the river, and being possessed of thousands of men and arms to man their canoes, they are a dangerous enemy. Originally the traders purchased the produce of the interior entirely from them, but of late years have sent their steamboats higher up the river to buy at first cost. Hence their determination to prevent the traders passing through their territory. Major Macdonald, who had been sent from England as Commissioner, arrived off Opobo in the Pheasant, on March 3, immediately after the arrival of Admiral Wells in the Raleigh. The Bramble came out of the river to join the flag, and next morning was under weigh, the Admiral shifted his flag to the Pheasant, and, with the Commissioner, proceeded up the river, where they were met by Consul Hewett, from Bonny.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Portugal in East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'all traffic with them forbidden, as in the case of the populous towns of Onitsha, Idah, &c., as in them there would have been competition of other merchants."" This is a mistake. It is impossible to say what towns he includes under ""&c.,"" but not only has the Niger Government never closed Idah to trade, but that place has actually been a port of entry for vessels ever since the issue of the charter. As a matter of fact, Onitsha, the most turbulent place in the territories, and the scene of constant trouble prior to the charter, is the only town that has ever been closed to trade.

The possession of a gun by a man further signified the passage from childhood to adulthood among the Sotho. The Sotho also suspected that the Cape government did not fully trust them. Besides, the chiefs suspected that the Cape government wanted to weaken them so as to turn them into slaves. There were further measures that drove the Sotho into armed resistance. In 1879 the Cape Colony proposed to alienate the Qluthing district to white farmers as a punishment for its Sotho chief, Moorosi, who had recently rebelled. Such action was in complete violation of the British promises to Moshoeshoe that no part of his country would be alienated.

Most of these nearly 5000 settlers had been sent to the new district of Albany where they held about 40 ha (100 acres) each. Although they may not have realized it, one of the main considerations for the establishment of the Albany settlement, as far as Governor Somerset was concerned, was that the settlers would assist with the defence and stabilization of the notorious Eastern Frontier.\nThe Cape Colony's economic situation and prospects had never been bright. The dangerous military situation on the frontier was simply aggra› vating the economic problems. The 1820 settlers were in a worse situation than the Dutch farmers living in the old districts of the Colony. By 1823, there were already indications that agriculture, expected to be Albany's staple economic activity and the main source of livelihood, was going to be a huge flop. To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit.

Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful. As already pointed out, the rest of the farmers had abandoned their holdings, some opting for other forms of employment in urban centres, or setting themselves up as independent traders, and many more taking to cattlefarming."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'was the devastation caused in areas surrounding the Zulu nation after 1800 and in the Zulu Wars from 1879 until the last rebellion in 1906.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

The Germans themselves did their best to provoke dis› affection among the African subjects of the Allies, being particularly active along the north-eastern border of Nigeria and in Libya. In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed.

The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Lamentations of Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Oh what grief, what sorrow of heart, what conflicts we are to encounter!

In June, 1865, Lord Stanley said in Parliament that ""a native of the Gold Coast in the eye of the law is not a British subject,"" and if so, how is it that we are in such a deplorable state, living dangerously without any rest, as with enemies rather than friends—enemies who seek to destroy us by taking our own countrymen as tools to deprive us of our rights.\n\nWe know that the English Government are wealthy, and do not desire the revenue of a poor country such as this to add to their riches, but certain it is that your officials here are greatly our oppressors.

The Governor declined to comply with the demand, and has since sent a company of Houssas with three guns to Prahsue. Fighting is reported to be proceeding between the Ashanti and Adansi tribes.\n\nThe British and African Steam Navigation Company's steamer Corisco, which arrived at Madeira on Saturday, February 5, brought information of a threatened war with King Mensah of Ashanti. The immediate cause of the outbreak is said to be the refusal of the Governor of Cape Coast Castle to surrender a native chief named Ganim, at present a refugee in the colony. Upon receiving from King Mensah's Ambassador the declaration of his Majesty's intentions, the Governor of Cape Coast Castle acted with considerable promptness in conveying information to the Home Government. The British and African steamer Corisco was chartered to proceed direct to Sierra Leone, without calling at her usual intermediate ports, and having apprised that town, which is the seat of the British Government on the West Coast of Africa, and is a depôt for a military force, to go on direct to Madeira without stopping at Teneriffe or Grand Canary, as is done in the usual course. By this means the intelligence was received at Madeira, and was telegraphed to England six days earlier than would have been the case had the Corisco been left to pursue her voyage under ordinary conditions.\n\nThe Corisco also brings news that, acting upon the information received from Cape Coast Castle, the Governor of Sierra Leone at once dispatched by the mail steamer Cameroon, also belonging to the British and African Company, a body of 250 men of the 2nd West India Regiment, which rendered excellent service during the late Ashanti war.\n\nThe forces at Cape Coast Castle consist mainly of Houssas, these being natives of superior education and discipline, who ordinarily fulfil the duties of military police, and whose valour in the field during the last war was repeatedly displayed. The Cameroon left on the 29th January, and proceeding direct, would reach Cape Coast in about four days' time, so that the threatened colony would be relieved on the 2nd inst., before which time it is hardly likely that any actual outbreak can have occurred."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Petition to Colonel Harley for the Defence of Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'To His Excellency Colonel R.

It may be of interest to your readers as showing what things are frequently occurring in a British colony which extends nowhere more than 80 miles back from the sea, and which has a Governor with £3,500 a year, a secretary, and four assistant secretaries, to govern less than half a million people, living in a country of only 12,000 square miles:—\n\n""The Accrofuls and Puttooboos, who have always been creating disturbances in their district, had recently a quarrel, which terminated in a fight. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, the Puttooboos caught a native of Accroful, and this man, it is reported, they cruelly treated. They first took him and put him to death. This done, they surrounded the body with knives and cut it into small pieces, scattering the latter subsequently in various parts of their town, and taking the blood of the poor man and sprinkling it over their fetish. The Puttooboos, bent still on mischief, it is reported, then prepared their arms, and marched towards Accroful. Evidently the action of the Puttooboos was the outcome of certain ill-will which they bore towards the Accrofuls, and which, it is believed, was partially occasioned by the action of either the one or the other with respect to flags. Company fights are generally brought about by demonstrations with flags, and it is, perhaps, superfluous to add that those between villages or towns may often trace their origin to the very same source. The Accrofuls, it is stated, were suddenly surprised by the arrival in their village of an armed band of Puttooboos, who, on nearing the village, and seeing people, fired on them. From this account, it would appear that the Puttooboos were in Accroful before the Accrofuls could know that one of their natives had been killed and cut to pieces. The work of arming for a contest did not, however, occupy many minutes, and before the Puttooboos could believe it, their opponents were ready for them. Each party must then have retired to a spot close by, and there butchered one another. The fight commenced at 6 a.m., and lasted till 2 p.m., several being killed and wounded. Meanwhile news of the disturbance reached Cape Coast, and Captain Stewart, the District Commissioner, left with a party of armed police for the scene of hostilities. But the fighting was over. The combatants had scattered. Some Houssas, too, arrived on the scene from Elmina. The District Commissioner only succeeded in bringing to Cape Coast four natives of Puttooboo as prisoners.

In the diminutive colony in Ambas Bay, annexed by England the year before last, grave discontent prevails at the prospect of its transfer to Germany, without the wishes of the residents being consulted in the least; as a matter of fact, it is directly opposed to them. The Consul came to see the Admiral, in order to endeavour to induce the latter to visit the rivers and land men from the Raleigh when necessary, as he is of opinion that some decisive step of this nature is necessary to put an end to the existing state of affairs and restore the Oil rivers to their normal condition. The Commander-in-Chief has not, however, seen his way to do this. He considers his presence at the Cape of Good Hope of such importance that he has not time to devote a day to visiting the Oil rivers, which are undoubtedly the most important part of his station. He has placed at the disposal of Consul Hewett the Watchful and the Wrangler, and has authorized force being used if considered necessary by the Consul. These two vessels, accordingly, were to leave for the Old Calabar river, meeting there Consul Hewett and Vice-Consul Johnson.\n\nFrom Cape Coast Castle we learn that recent advices from Ashanti show the country to be in an alarming state. The Becquahs, numbering 15,000 strong, are encamped at Donquassie; whilst their rivals, the Adansis, numbering only 3,000, are at Dumpoassie, within about four hours' march of each other. The Becquahs threaten that unless the Adansis consent to their nomination to the throne of Coomassie, further hostilities will be at once commenced. Meanwhile Captain Firminger, the English Commissioner, has sent a message to the King of Becquah, asking him to wait pending further communication from the Governor; but it is doubtful whether this will have the effect of delaying hostilities. Already the trade with Cape Coast Castle is absolutely closed, and it is feared that if once warlike operations recommence it will be a long time before the trade can be reopened.\n\nThe number of troops at the disposal of the Governor of the Gold Coast, in view of these threatened native troubles, is not large, the Gold Coast Colony and Sierra Leone between them only possessing about 800 officers and men of the 1st West India Regiment, besides the local police.

We gave an account in our last of the installation of the first Christian King of Cape Coast. We published a very praiseworthy speech made by the King. Before his election the royal stool had been for rather a long time vacant. The kingship of Cape Coast—of a town under the very walls of Cape Coast Castle, and within which town (from the time when an influx of troops took place at the Castle during the Ashantee War) the Governor and other civil authorities have been actually residing—was looked upon as a matter of so little consequence, that some of the best English friends of the Gold Coast have been of opinion that no such person ought to be recognised. But the new King seems to have taken his dignity and position and power seriously—to have looked upon them as facts to be asserted, and not mere myths. He has appointed magistrates, one of whom bears the title of Chief Magistrate, and taken other measures for making his rule effective. A conflict of authority was necessarily one of the earliest results. One of the King's magistrates having by artful means got a clerk of a British subject, and said to be himself a British subject, though his family are natives of Cape Coast, within his clutches, refuses to allow him to make a journey on which his master had sent him, and on his disputing the authority which detained him, and asserting his right to leave, orders him to be thrown violently to the ground by some half-dozen of his myrmidons, and there severely flogged. His master, on the facts coming to his knowledge, complained to the Governor, who, as in duty bound, immediately interfered. The King of Cape Coast, however, came forward and took upon himself the responsibility of what had occurred. Communications take place between Governor and King, and the former considers himself treated with so much insolence, that he counsels and authorises the bringing a civil action for damages against the King's magistrate, who had committed the offence. This order of civil action, instead of criminal proceedings, was in itself weakness; but the Governor is reported to have promised that he would insist on the payment of any damages that might be awarded. We cannot enter at length into all the details of interviews between the Governor and his counsellors and the King, in which his Excellency's efforts failed so much, that the Governor, before the King left, informed him, in the name of Her Majesty, that he could no longer recognise him as the King of Cape Coast, and very properly, that he would not allow him to have prisons in Cape Coast Town.\n\nThe court gave damages and costs against the King's magistrate, who had refused to appear."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-24', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Cape Coast Castle, Feb. 19.\n\nThe Gamins have attacked Inquansah, a village near Coomassie, and taken many prisoners.

Within the affected West African localities themselves, socio-political changes of revolutionary character also took place, occasioned by the massive movements of population.$^{26}$ In Yorubaland, the wars led to large-scale destruction of pre-nineteenth century settlements, the foundation of a whole series of new towns and considerable enlargement of existing ones. In the area of Old Qyo, which exemplified the huge loss of population involved, established towns includ› ing the ancient Oyo city itself, Igboho, Ikoyi, Igbon, Iresa and Oje were destroyed. Beyond that, other Yoruba towns destroyed included Sabe, Ketu, Owu and a whole series of Egba and related Remo communities.

Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly.

A switch meant changing old trade habits and methods, and dealing with a new set of white traders. Internally too, it was more difficult to process palm oil, and to crack the palm nuts to obtain the kernels than to organize slave supply. For the delta merchants, it meant having to penetrate deeper into the hinterland to the centres of production, and the use of a larger labour force and canoes. It was a situation with the potential for making the old established leaders bankrupt, and encouraging the rise of new enterprising ones. Three major develop› ments flowed from this: first, the new trade led to an increase in the internal slave trade to supply the manpower requirements of the delta states; second, the growth of new Houses and Heads resulted in the disturbance of the internal political balance (Dike's slave revolts) and, third, competition for the hinterland markets led to several wars between the delta states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Omani penetration and the expansion of trade > The effects of long-distance trade on East African societies', 'content': ""accumulated from the trade.

In western Tanzania such warriors of fortune were known as ruga-ruga and were mainly drawn from war-captives, runaway slaves, deserting porters, social outcasts and young men who would have normally performed military service. Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another.

Rather, the various Igbo communities would appear to have engaged in inter-group wars, raids, and kidnappings for slaves to sell to the delta states and the Efik of Calabar, who served as middlemen. That is, although Igboland provided most of the slaves sold at the ports of Bonny, and Elem Kalahari, in the Niger delta, and at Calabar on the Cross river estuary, the Igbo did not come into direct contact with the Europeans before the nineteenth century. Also, the Igbo country was not reached by visiting Europeans until the closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. And these initial contacts took place along such river routes as the Niger, the Imo, and the Cross river. Thus the communities at the market centres on the rivers at which the coastal middlemen met hinterland traders became better known than others. The Aro who controlled the internal trade routes and some of the markets at which the coastal middlemen purchased slaves and, later, palm oil and palm kernels became notorious for their abilities both as traders and as the operators of a well-reputed oracle. Similarly, the Ndoki towns of Akwette and Ohombele on the Imo river served as the markets for Bonny and Opobo.

And for the rest of the century, the internal trade for slaves among the coastal peoples increased because of the demands of the palm-oil trade.

But they very soon discovered that European demands upon them were equally, if not more, intolerable.

These tribes, with true African blindness to consequences, harassed in every way the Yorubas in their efforts to drive back the Fulah conquerers, curtailed their supply of guns and powder, upon which their safety depended, demanded exorbitant prices for such articles as they condescended to allow them to purchase, and to the best of their ability revenged themselves for former oppressions at their hands.

The continual wars led to slave catching, and the result was that the trade routes to the interior were, with few exceptions, closed to traffic, and it was more difficult for a trader to penetrate beyond the coast line than for a Mohammedan to traverse the desert of Sahara.

Yoruba remained under their yoke for many years, but at length the inhabitants of a large town called Ibadan rose, reconquered all the old Yoruba towns, and drove the invaders back to Ilorin. This was the state of affairs when I arrived in Lagos in 1891, but a desultory war was still in progress, its sole object on either side being the maintenance of the slave trade. The Ibadan Army, consisting of about 20,000 men, was encamped at a place called Ikirun, and the Ilorin Army, which was much smaller, but had some Cavalry, was settled at Offa, a few hours march from Ilorin. The object of this so-called war was to capture slaves and to plunder, and so neither side was anxious to come to a permanent settlement.

The entire trade of the Colony depended on the route through Jebu territory, Lagos having natural advantages for trade development owing to its situation at the mouth of the waterway communication with the sea, which tapped some 20,000 square miles. Action on the part of any of the tribes to block the way affected the whole of the different authorities, as they were dependent on one another for the maintenance of private treaties affecting their slaves. Internal feuds might exist on matters affecting the people themselves, but within seventy or eighty miles of the coast any disturbance was apt to block the transit of goods, and trade became paralysed. Great Britain having defined, along with France, a boundary between Dahomey and Yorubaland, and having assumed the latter country as a sphere of influence, had responsibilities which she could not disregard, and the promotion of commerce, of missionary enterprise, and the well-being of the people demanded her attention. It was essential that there should be free communication with the interior, and that the Yorubas should not be prevented from bringing their produce to the coast. The authorities of Jebu had taken an antagonistic attitude to the Government of Lagos on account of its remonstrance for blocking the routes. A visit of the acting governor was treated with disdain. Subsequently an apology was demanded, failing which steps to compel obedience would be taken. On Jan. 21, Jebu messengers visited Lagos and made apologies for insults given to the acting governor, and afterwards a treaty was entered into. Following this the Egba authorities at Abeokuta closed their roads, and the letter containing the remonstrance was returned unopened. The Jebu authorities had intimated that the agreement was made without authority, and the result was that the whole trade was blocked on every side. They were of opinion that Clause 2 of the Jebu agreement was the cause of this combined action of the authorities of Abeokuta and Jebu. The Jebus in the past had put Abeokuta under obligations to them for returning the slaves passing from Yorubaland to the free soil of the British Colony, and the Jebus had had large payments for these services, which, together with the taxes on merchandise passing through, brought a larger revenue than the £500 provided for in the agreement now repudiated. And the authorities of Abeokuta professed to be aggrieved at the British having taken over the protection of the kingdom of Ilaro, bordering on Dahomeyland. Ilaro was conquered by the Egbas fifty years ago, and paid tribute to them until some few years ago. Abeokuta, being unable to give protection to Ilaro against Dahomeyan raids, Ilaro made a claim to independence, and sought to place itself under British protection. This was done by proclamation on Aug. 13, 1891, and following the decision of the Brussels Conference Ilaro would be included in the Protectorate. The authorities of Abeokuta subsequently recognised the right of Ilaro to protection from the Lagos Government. The time has come when the Government must take steps as would ensure freedom of passage to everyone, and having made arrangements to see that they were carried out. They asked this not only on commercial but humanitarian grounds. They believed that a display of force would bring about all that was wanted, and while so much activity was being displayed elsewhere in Africa it was not inappropriate that the present position should be taken advantage of to put an end to those interior difficulties which caused stoppage of trade and widespread misery to the population of Yorubaland.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1892#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Roads from Lagos to the Interior of Yoruba, Etc.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""To the Right Hon.

From the boundary of their territory to the town of Abeokuta the distance is, as the crow flies, about 85 miles of land, which is inhabited by the Yoruba tribes of the Ketus and Egbados. Towards the south lies the territory of Porto Novo, Ado, Ota, Badagry; the whole extending north to south about 45 miles. This gives an area of about 3,000 square miles of land inhabited by industrious farm labourers; it is the region from which we draw our supply of animal and vegetable provisions, the country which to a large degree supplies the trade of Lagos; the Ijebu country in the east being as yet only open on its coast line. Now what is the result of the annual inroads of the Dahomeyans into this territory? Let it be understood that the inhabitants of these 3,000 square miles do not, for one-third of the year, feel themselves safe from attack, and that this third of the year is the most important part of the year to the farmers—the planting time. It has happened during the last few years that the poor farmers have been lingering about their farms preparing them for the planting of yams, Indian corn, and other things, when the enemy has fallen upon them and carried them away, so that the authorities of Abeokuta have now forbidden them to remain in their farm-villages during this season of danger. But what is the consequence of all this? People fear the breaking out of famine in Abeokuta—a large town inhabited by 100,000 farmers. What an anomaly in a country so thinly populated, and deprived, as it has been so largely, of its able-bodied labourers, by a century of the slave-trade, and yet so it is. This very year the Dahomeyan hordes hunted the country up and down, making towns and villages unsafe, kidnapping on a large scale—refugees from Ota came even here to Lagos—until they finally pounced upon two villages in the Ketu country, which they completely sacked, and returned loaded with plunder. Under such circumstances, how can trade flourish, when people are unable to obtain the necessaries of life, and when their town is threatened with famine? It is but little likely that he who is in anxiety about the needful harvest will take much trouble to gather in palm-nuts, which ripen during the same first four months of the year, or to gather in the cotton which at the same time whitens his fields. Both must rot or be destroyed by birds and insects. It is not easy to imagine how great the amount of produce would be that might be obtained from this extensive region if those yearly raids were put a stop to. One strange feature in the case is, that this happens so near to Lagos—only some twenty miles from the lagoon, which is navigable nearly the whole of the before-mentioned eighty-five miles of territory. The loss arising from these raids is not by any means confined to the people who are the first to suffer; but the trade of Lagos, whether as regards that done in the direction of Abeokuta, Badagry, or Porto Novo, suffers most seriously. It is to be hoped that England will not overlook this matter when the time for settlement with the King of Dahomey comes. If he can be restrained, both humanity and commerce will gain greatly by it.""', 'last_edit_date': '1892-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE YORUBA COUNTRIES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have never ceased to assert that, although some trade may be done at points of the coast where there is no established British authority, the presence of a European and Christian civilization in power is indispensable to the advancement of native Africa. We seem to have a new and striking instance in support of this at Lagos, for the erection of which into a British colony we, among others, have been so much and so greatly condemned, not only by those whose mercantile operations were unfortunately rendered for a time less profitable, but by others who, though unsurpassed in their desires for the national, social, and religious improvement of the Africans, think that this could be effected solely by the influence of missionaries, in conjunction with the European commerce which may be carried on to some extent where they are present. A considerable trade was carried on at Lagos while it was under native rule and British protection. But that trade was really created by the latter; because until Great Britain had obtained the defending and nominally, controlling power there, Lagos had been one of the great seats of that foreign slave-trade the history of the active ravages of which in western Africa is now, we hope, nearly closed. But though legitimate trade of some considerable importance sprang up and was successfully carried on at Lagos under the new order of things, the influence of Lagos as a country was not on the side of Christian civilization. The presence of the representatives of the protecting power alone prevented the slave-trade, which continued to be carried on in driblets through Porto Novo and Badagry, from becoming rampant as before. Lagos, as a native power, being more or less at variance with the other native rule on the mainland shores of the Lagoon, had its chief commercial relations with the interior at Abeokuta, which there was facility of access by river; and its commerce was augmented by the palm oil trade of Porto Novo and Badagry. Abeokuta was the only bright spot in those dark parts of the world. Liberated slaves, natives of that country, educated and instructed in the rudiments of the Christian faith, returned there from Sierra Leone. European missionary establishments followed them; and, although paganism still ruled, it became gradually restrained in some of its great enormities by British influences thus introduced. But it was pagan at core, and fond of little wars wherein slaves might be taken for labour, enjoyment, or sale through Dahomey. In virtue, however, of its continuous friendly relations with Lagos—the natural shipping port for the whole of these countries—of the presence of a considerable missionary body, and of many active Sierra Leone traders in it, it became the emporium of the interior, and the great road of traffic passed through it. ""If you wish to make me happy get from between me and the sun,"" said the ancient Greek. ""Get from between me and the sea,"" is the continual cry of the interior of Africa to the populations intervening between it and the great waters. It was because they would not allow free access to the sea that the Dahomans fought and pressed forward until they destroyed all the peoples which barred their access to the coast, at Wydah and neighbouring ports. It is because the sea with all its contingent advantages is there, that Ashantee is the irreconcilable enemy of the Fantee tribes lying between it and Cape Coast. In the same way Abeokuta stood between the large populations of Yoruba and Lagos. As the only open road for Yoruban and the far interior produce had been through Abeokuta, with great advantage to the latter place, which desired to take toll of all that passed by it, the Abeokutans declared that it should be the only road, and determined to use all their power to maintain this, and gratify at the time their slave-acquiring propensities. With the establishment of British rule and authority in the colony of Lagos, all the petty rivalries and hatreds between Lagos and the mainland rulers on the Lagoons were doomed to disappear. The great town of Ibadan, with double the population of Abeokuta, which had sold produce and received supplies in driblets through Abeokuta, desired to have free access to Lagos and its important markets by the more direct road of Ikorodu. The authorities of Lagos saw their duty clearly in this matter. The present Lieutenant-Governor, Captain Glover, had a personal acquaintance with Yoruba and the Niger countries beyond, and was deeply penetrated with the enormous advantages that might accrue, not only commercially to Lagos, but as regards the development of resources and spread of Christian civilization in Yoruba, if its large populations could obtain and maintain a free road through Ikorodu to the Lagos lagoon. When the Egbas, therefore, after the retirement of the Ibadans in the late war, laid siege to Ikorodu, they were warned by the Governor of Lagos that unless they made themselves masters of it, and established their sovereignty over that part within a given time, they must abandon the enterprise. They did not make themselves masters—they were repulsed in every attempt, but they remained in force in an entrenched camp, and stopped the way. Notice was given them to retire—they mocked at it—they defied the power that requested their departure—and Minie rifles and Congreve rockets in disciplined hands were sent over from Lagos to teach them that Great Britain only advises and requires what she has power to enforce. The rifles and rockets did their appointed work. The road from Ibadan to Lagos, through Ikorodu, was permanently opened; and a lesson was taught—an important lesson, which may bring to that part of Africa results more beneficial than language can describe. They were taught that, since Great Britain is in Lagos, war in the adjacent countries cannot, and shall not, be carried on without her license and permission. We refer our readers to the intelligence under the head of Lagos. War—war—war—little wars for slaves, and for little objects—was the curse of those as of other portions of native Africa. And if these can be permanently put an end to, as we believe that through the influence of Lagos—British Lagos—they will, the great bar to the material development of the rich Egba and Yoruba countries will be removed, and a free access will be given to the propagation of Christianity, and to the influence of the example of civilization which Lagos, daily cleansing and improving, will present to every native trader from the interior who may visit its markets. We feel our old conviction that colonial Lagos would prove a mighty agent in the work of African regeneration was a just one, and that its influence is about to make itself most beneficially felt through the vast regions with respect to which it occupies so important a position.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Troubles with the Jebus', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From Lagos, under date June 20, we are told that the markets in the Jebu country have re-opened, and the natives have resumed trading.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest. It would appear, indeed, that the African dimension theory provides a better rounded, more historically focused theory of the partition than any of the purely Eurocentric theories.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914 > Ethiopia', 'content': ""the British who favoured Italian expansion in the hope of curbing that of France, their principal rival in the Scramble for Africa. The Italian officer in charge of the occupation, Rear-Admiral Caimi, proclaimed to the inhabitants that this action was taken in agreement with the British and Egyptians, and promised: 'No obstacle shall be put by me on your trade; on the contrary, all my exertions shall aim at facilitating it.'$^{41}$ This profession, however, rapidly proved worthless, for the Italians soon stopped the supply of arms to Yohannes, and penetrated inland as far as the villages of Sahati and Wia. Ras Alula protested against this infiltration, but the Italians replied by fortifying the disputed areas, and by sending more troops which were intercepted by Ras Alula at Dogali in January 1887. The invaders thereupon evacuated Sahati and Wia, but, complaining of a 'massacre' at Dogali, blockaded all shipping bringing supplies to Ethiopia. 42 War between the Italians and Yohannes seemed imminent, but the former, anxious to avoid a difficult mountainous campaign, persuaded Britain to mediate. A British diplomat, Sir Gerald Portal, was dispatched to the Emperor to ask him to agree to an Italian occupation of Sahati and Wia, and of the Senahit or Bogos area which the Egyptians had ceded in 1884. When these proposals were read out, Yohannes bluntly answered 'I can do nothing with all this. By the Treaty made by Admiral Hewett, all the country evacuated by the Egyptians on my frontier was ceded to me at the instigation of England, and now you come to ask me to give it up again.' Angered that Britain had thus departed from the treaty, he wrote to Queen Victoria, protesting that if she wished to make peace it should be when the Italians were in their country and the Ethiopians in theirs. 43 Yohannes, faced with the growing threat from Italy, strengthened his defences by moving up a garrison stationed on the Sudan frontier. Finding the area unguarded, the Mahdists attacked there.

The British and French foreign ministers, Hoare and Laval, therefore met in Paris on 7 December to devise a new compromise. It had two main principles: first, an 'exchange of territories' whereby Ethiopia would cede to Italy the Ogaden and a large part of Tigre in exchange for a port on either the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden; second, Italy would be given a 'zone of economic expansion and colonization' in the greater part of Ethiopia south of Addis Ababa; this area was to remain part of Ethiopia, but Italy was to have exclusive economic rights therein. News of this plan, which was a criminal surrender to the condemned aggressor and a total abandonment of the League, leaked to the French press, and created a storm of indignation in many countries, particularly in Britain where Hoare was obliged to resign on 18 December. 118 Ethiopia at the close of 1935 was thus in the forefront of world news and the centre of international excitement and indignation.

Though the Ethiopian army was soon to be defeated, much fierce fighting lay ahead before the Italians occupied Addis Ababa on 6 May 1936. This was followed by five long years of Italian Fascist usurpation, during four of which the Ethiopian patriots were to fight on alone. 121 The Duce's invasion evoked instant reaction in and around Africa. 122 In August 1935, a group of Africans and persons of African descent in London founded the International African Friends of Abyssinia, whose committee included C.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': ""Because the lands and peoples were so interwoven, developments in one part always had effects and implications in other parts.

Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed.

They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

They disregarded it coolly enough when they took Tunis, and the Sultan has never forgiven them.""\n\n""In Africa itself the French may do a good deal—until they are stopped. They may, for example, make a dash for Darfur. Captain Monteil is one of the ablest and most energetic of the French colonial officers. He has a large force at his command, and he is certain to go as far as his orders allow him, and perhaps beyond. But the occupation of Darfur is a project that the French Government would not lightly sanction. The province lies just north of the territory which we have leased to the Congo State. It is an old province of Egypt, and Egyptian rights over it have been formally recognised as still existing. The French could get at it by advancing north-east from their present possessions on the Congo. If they reached it, they would find themselves within easy distance of Kordofan on the Nile, and in a direct line to Cairo. But they would also find rather serious European complications—more serious than I think they would care to face. I fancy they already realise that Germany is quite willing to lead them on now and make the pace, and then to leave them in the lurch as soon as matters begin to get serious. With regard to our proper course in Africa, we should do as little as possible in the interior, except where the land is suitable for permanent European settlement, and instead of spending money on speculative annexations we should strengthen the Navy. If we have the command of the sea we have everything. In the event of a great war the whole of Africa, including Egypt and Algeria, and possibly even the Cape, will fall to the Power that commands the sea. It is because that I know that our Navy is not yet as strong as it should be, that I try to discourage in every way I can enterprises that must cost much immediately, and may bring no return.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE ON THE CONGO', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We may assume, then, that the nation will support the Foreign Office in the policy it has announced. But that makes it only the more necessary to be satisfied that the claim advanced is founded in right, and justified by its importance. The French papers—for we have no reason yet to suppose that the French Government disputes our claim—allege with truth that we have no treaty with France on this subject. But we have treaties with Germany and Italy, subsequently recognised by the Congo State, in which our claim to control the whole valley of the Nile has been stated and allowed. It is matter of common knowledge for five years past that we have made this claim. French statesmen cannot be ignorant of this, and they have never thought it necessary to protest against it. But there is yet another ground for our position. We are, by the consent of Europe, in occupation of Egypt, and Egypt cannot tolerate a Great Power in possession of the upper waters of the Nile. It is a matter of life and death to her. Herodotus told us long ago that Egypt was the gift of the Nile; and the gift may be recalled by anyone who can place a strong hand on the sources or the upper course of the great river. The responsibility of protecting Egypt carries with it the responsibility of protecting that which gives Egypt its existence. Technically, no doubt, the plea is weakened by the abandonment of the Soudan, which has perhaps ceased thereby to be Egyptian territory—though it might be argued that the abandonment was only a temporary measure occasioned by pressing emergencies. But the practical necessity remains unaltered, and it cannot be denied that France would be doing an ""unfriendly act"" in coming across Africa to interfere with us. Her statesmen cannot but know that we hold, in Sir E. Grey\'s carefully corrected words, that ""the British and Egyptian spheres of influence together cover the whole of the Nile waterway."" With a certain section of French politicians this, indeed, is no objection. They are quite conscious that it would be an ""unfriendly act,"" and for that very reason they wish to do it. They have no desire for themselves to colonise either the Upper Congo or the Upper Nile, but their sole aim—as Mr. Chamberlain quoted from a speech in the French Chamber—has been ""to make England feel the harm she is doing us in not keeping her engagements in Egypt, and to show her that we can come up to her elsewhere than in the Mediterranean."" That is language which may suit an excited debate, but which cannot be gravely used by any serious statesman; and we trust that French Ministers may take some opportunity of repudiating it. French and English interests rub one another, as we have said, all over the globe. They may require frequent explanation and adjustment, but none of them ought to be enough to bring about the calamity of ""unfriendly"" relations between two great countries. We have certainly done our part to avert this calamity. Sir E. Grey said with truth that ""during the last two years no provocation whatever has come from our side."" But, as he added, ""something else besides our own effort is necessary, and that is the co-operation of the French Government and the French public."" We hope this appeal will not be in vain, and that the grave, moderate, and restrained language in which these matters have been discussed in the House of Commons will find an appropriate echo in the French Chamber.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FRANCO-BELGIAN DISPUTE IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It appears—if the organs of the French Ministry may be relied upon—that the force which is to leave France this month for Africa, under the command of Captain Monteil, will number when it has joined the contingent of Captain Decazes, now guarding the Ubanghui, about 600 men and 18 or 20 officers. It must be noted that this force, backed up as it will be by two gunboats, several steam launches and lighters for transport purposes, consists, not of raw, undisciplined Native levies, but for the most part of white soldiers of the Foreign Legion and Senegalese tirailleurs, men who besides being well drilled and armed, are inured to the African climate. The officers, too, who have been chosen, are picked men. Captain Monteil is well known for his remarkable voyage, lasting two years and a half, in the course of which he traversed Africa from west to north, beginning at St. Louis and ending at Tripoli, a voyage of which the result has been to increase tenfold French ambition, and to establish, or at any rate to lay the foundation, of French influence in countries where no Frenchman had set foot before. Over and above this fact several of the officers accompanying him have also seen service in Africa. One of them was for many years an active political agent on the Upper Niger; another was with Captain Binger in his lengthy exploration of the Gold and Ivory Coast ""hinterlands""; all are men of exceptional merit. When we consider all this; when we are very palpably and unpleasantly made aware of the fierce opposition of France to the Anglo-Belgian agreement; when we are plainly informed of the ambitious schemes she nourished with regard to Africa generally; when her Chauvinists bring home to us with praiseworthy frankness that they intend to use every means in their power to prevent this country from monopolising the course of the Nile, surely it becomes imperative that we should be informed of the ultimate destination of this expedition. But even then, even if we receive binding and definite assurances from the French Government that no advance to the Nile is included in the instructions handed to Captain Monteil, we have still much room for doubt as to whether those instructions will not be exceeded. Former experiences have taught us that when French officers embark on some military enterprise in Africa, and think that by making a great coup they can cover themselves with glory, they will do so, instructions or no instructions, knowing well that no French Ministry is strong enough to convict them for breach of discipline in the teeth of popular admiration. It behoves, then, the Government of this country to watch with the greatest attention the developments of the Franco-Belgian dispute. England cannot remain inactive in the face of the feverish activity displayed by other Powers. France must never be allowed to establish herself on the Nile under pretext of protecting the rights of the Ottoman Empire, or under any other pretext. We are willing to meet her in other ways, as far as our national dignity and our national interests will permit us, but she must clearly understand once and for all that the Nile she must not touch. Meanwhile, how do we stand? What guarantees have we? What line of action are we about to adopt? These are questions to which the people of Great Britain expect an answer, and that promptly, before dilatoriness and vacillation shall have had time to work incalculable injury to interests of which the stupendous future magnitude is, even at this day, but imperfectly realised.—*Pall Mall Gazette.*', 'last_edit_date': '1894-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The New Agreement between France and the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""As might be expected, the English Press does not take at all kindly to the terms of this new agreement. Apart from the question of feeling induced by the present state of home politics, *The Times* points out that the questions which are now settled have been in dispute between King Leopold and the French Foreign Office for some years, and no doubt it was the publication of the Anglo-Belgian Agreement of May last that brought matters to a crisis and compelled a settlement. It will be well to recall the position taken up by the two disputants. On the one hand, the French Government contended that from the point where the Ubanghi passed south of the 4deg. of north latitude to the 30 deg. of east longitude that parallel was the northern boundary of the Free State. On the other, King Leopold maintained his right to extend his frontiers in any direction where he did not encroach on territory of another European Power. Acting on this view he established posts in the neighbourhood of the Mbomu, an important affluent of the Welle-Ubanghi, which it entered not far from the point where the main Ubanghi stream dipped below the fourth parallel; and also despatched a large force into the valley of the Upper Nile. Against this expedition the British Government protested, and the Congo State was warned that it had invaded territory within the British sphere of influence. As the result of negotiations, the famous agreement of May last was concluded. The storm of indignation which this agreement excited in Paris was such that almost the first act of the new Ministry was to announce that France declined to recognise the validity of the new agreement; and the position taken up in Paris was that it was incompetent for the Congo Free State to extend its boundaries beyond the limits fixed by the General Act of the Berlin Conference, and that the principle involved in the granting of a lease by one Power to another could not be in any way recognised. An examination of the new agreement reveals the fact that the French Government has receded from both these positions. The *thalweg* of the Mbomu, and not the fourth parallel, is now recognised by France as the northern boundary of the Free State to the parting of the Congo and Nile basins, which boundary follows the water-parting to 30°, the eastern limit of the Free State. Beyond 30° the Congo State binds itself not to occupy the leased territory to the north of latitude 5° 30' N. Thus clear France has recognised the right of the Free State to go north of the 4th parallel, and also the principle of leasing to which they at first so strenuously objected. In return for these concessions, the Congo State has renounced its rights to occupy the leased territory to the west of the 30th meridian and north of latitude 5° 30' N. This is practically an undertaking that the Free State will not occupy the Bahr-el-Ghazal and will leave the road to the Nile open north of Lado. It is important to remember, however, that the British Government is in no way a party to the new arrangement. All the agreements under which arrangements between European Powers in Africa have been concluded is that they affect only the rights of the contracting parties and leave untouched the rights of others. We understand that the terms of the agreement between France and the Congo State were submitted to her Majesty's Government; but as we were not a party to it, we could neither approve nor disapprove of its terms. The new agreement, therefore, leaves untouched the question of our rights in the Upper Nile Valley. It cannot detract from the title of a lessor that his lessee does not enter into possession, and our claims on the Upper Nile are precisely what they were before the signature of the latest Franco-Belgian agreement. What that position is has frequently been stated. Germany, Italy, and the Congo State have all recognised the Upper Nile Valley as within the British sphere. France could neither approve nor disapprove of its terms. The new agreement, therefore, leaves untouched the question of our rights in the Upper Nile Valley.

Mahdists and Senoussists would soon combine against the advance of the Nazarene. A great military nation such as France could undoubtedly ""smash the Mahdi,"" and occupy those countries, if determined to make the necessary sacrifices; but it would have the constant disadvantage of its only line of communication being a desert railway 2,000 miles in length, menaced by the Tuaric tribes, by the possible hostility of Turkey on its Tripoli flank and by the probable disaffection of its Mussulman subjects in Algeria and Tunis. It needs no demonstration that the success of such a struggle against Islam militant would be of incalculable political advantage to England in its Niger Protectorate, in Egypt and in its East African possessions; but to anticipate having the chestnuts thus pulled out of the fire for us would be to reckon too much on French idealism.\n\nThese considerations, however, suggest a collateral and important question. Assuming that my belief is wrong as to the necessary slowness of development in Central African regions, and that the outposts of French settlements advance with rapid strides to our frontiers, ought this to be a subject for our regret? To me there seems but one rational answer. England, too, has a gigantic task before her in developing the 500,000 square miles which fall within her sphere of action in the Niger-Tchad basins. Every new success of France in the work of civilisation in her own sphere would not only encourage us in our labours, but would certainly afford us many new and useful ideas of procedure; while every passing failure—and there must be many—would teach us what to avoid. The two nations are so distinct in their genius and methods that each will have much to learn from the other in the creation of agricultural wealth in these vast regions, where every feature is abnormal and where the experience of colonial expansion elsewhere is of little use. It cannot, indeed, be denied that there would be a tendency to friction on a long and not very clearly marked frontier line in the heart of Africa; but firm administration and friendly diplomacy should easily dispose of this difficulty.

They succeeded in repulsing it, and the survivors of the Anglo-French force were obliged to evacuate Tamatave, leaving behind the corpses of their slain comrades, whose heads were cut off by the Malagasy and impaled on poles as a warning to other would-be invaders.

The uprising he organized was the only Menalamba movement in which commercial considerations played a fundamental part: the aim was to take control of regional trade, of which the Indians and Creoles had a virtual monopoly, which is why they were attacked. In the nearby regions of the Imerina, the relations of the Menalamba leaders maintained with local kings and dignitaries were instrumental in the spread of some of their ideas. The Tanala Rainimangoro, for instance, declared that he had received orders from Antananarivo to drive out the French. 19 Elsewhere, such relations were non-existent. In the provinces that were most firmly controlled and hence most heavily exploited, the fall of Antananarivo in September 1895 was the signal for attacks on the Manamboninahitra, who were chiefly officer merchants, and on Merina immigrants and foreigners.

In the first instance, these revolts were directed exclusively against the Merina oligarchy. Until October 1895, when the governor-general of the province, Rainandriamampandry, was recalled to Antananarivo, members of the Betsimisaraka tended to destroy the soldiers' rice fields, refused to feed the royal army, or else merely deserted.

These explanations were inadequate, since they overlooked an essential aspect of the insurrection (the struggle for the recovery of freedom) and the organizational ability of the insurgents, who attacked all those who personified the colonial administration, whether they were French occupying forces or Malagasy civil servants or schoolteachers. By way of conclusion to his study of the 1904 rebellion, G. Jacob states that it undoubtedly had a twofold significance: 'it was a fight for independence and a struggle against colonial exploitation'.$^{26}$ The suppression of this first revolt against the oppression of the administration forced the Malagasy to seek other forms of struggle.\nOne of the most widespread forms of anti-colonial response was passive resistance: a refusal to comply with orders; the rejection of everything that was regarded as a sign of 'civilization' but was closely bound up with colonization and the foreign presence; keeping children away from school, which was looked upon in some circles as merely being a form of 'colonial forced labour'; and abandonment of the villages created along the roads in the south in an attempt to keep the population together. These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905.

So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war.

While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam.

Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in French West Africa, 1880-1900 > Tukulor empire', 'content': ""French. 1 1 In 1884, at the head of an imposing army, Ahmadu went up the Niger towards Bamako. However, contrary to all expectations, he suddenly headed for Kaarta not to attack or threaten the fragile lines of communication of the French but rather to besiege Nioro, the capital of Kaarta with a view to deposing his brother Moutaga, its king whom he considered as too independent of the central authority. ' 2 It is obvious from Ahmadu's attack on his brother rather than on the French, and the fact that the Bambara of the district of Beledugu near Bamako were still in rebellion, that he was still not fully in control in his own territory and that he still needed the support of the French. This surely must account for his reaction to the French invasions between 1881 and 1883. His need for French co-operation was further strengthened by the fact that the siege of Nioro further depleted his military resources. The French, on their part, were also desperate for an alliance with Ahmadu. Between 1885 and 1888, they were engaged in the suppression of the rebellion of the Soninke leader Mamadou Lamine and they were most anxious therefore to prevent any alliance between him and Ahmadu. Hence, although Ahmadu was aware that the French were still aiding the Bambara rebels, he nevertheless agreed to conclude another treaty, the Treaty of Gori, on 12 May 1887. Under its terms, Ahmadu agreed to place his empire under the nominal protection of the French while the French in turn pledged not to invade his territories and to remove the ban that they had placed on the purchase of arms by Ahmadu."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The western and southern Volta plateaux', 'content': 'In this region, lineage groups and clans that for the most part lacked centralized power stood up rather well to the upheavals of the time. The area had witnessed for centuries the penetration of the Joola (Dyula) and the Marka who, through intermarriage with the indigenous peoples, had evolved new cultural, social and economic groups, one prototype being the Bobo-Joola people. A purely theoretical line should not, however, be drawn between peoples with centralized power and the others. In fact, centralization can take non-political forms, such as the poro society of the Senufo, a very large-scale religious community that determined social hierarchy. It is therefore in no way surprising that peoples with little political hierarchy should have weathered the turmoil of the nineteenth century differently from societies with more elaborate political structures. Such observations help us to understand the turbulent history of the Voltaic groups in this region during the nineteenth-century: invasions, preventive attacks, resistance, adaptation and intermarriage. Generally, while more or less vigorously rejecting attempts at domination on the part of the Mande, Mossi, Zerma, Marka and Fulbe groups, the more sedentary, indigenous peoples became used to their presence and economic activity, moving when political pressure or economic exaction became too great.

This corroborates the report we have heard, that the Abeokutans preferred taking women prisoners to the men, not because they were afraid of the men, but that the women may be kept for wives.\n\nI think the poor women like rather to stop at Abeokuta than stopping at Dahomey. A very short time before going to attack Abeokuta, seven poor young women were killed for having transgressed with men, but the men were spared.

Three weeks ago our trade was stopped by orders having come from the King to seize every pot of palm-oil seen carried by any of his subjects for less than half-price, to aid him in buying back his people from the Abeokutans. This order, of course, obliged the oil-sellers to hide their oil instead of bringing it to market. We have been obliged to send messenger after messenger, which has induced him to give up, and now we are getting in better trade.\n\nThe French Commissioner, who went to Dahomey three weeks ago with the Consul, Mr. Dumas, has sent down a circular to report that he has been kept and treated as a prisoner.

This petition has been drawn up and sent forwarded to the Governor-in-chief, Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy, for transmission to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. To our surprise, he (the Governor-in-Chief) arrived here on the 5th of May, with the petition, and on the morning of the 6th the inhabitants waited upon his Excellency. On this occasion after some palaver, he said that he and Admiral Patey had proposed that the colony should be given over to the French Government; he further said that the Gambia was intended for the French, and that the French will be of more service to us than the British. Is this a fact that he said? The whole of the Gambia population, already used to British laws and British manners and customs, how can we live with the French? Are we to become French subjects?

In the event of hostilities breaking out, much anxiety is felt regarding the safety of the Europeans in outlying districts, where the foreign population would probably be attacked indiscriminately, the natives there being quite unable to distinguish between French and English. A further result of a struggle would be the development of a strong feeling against Christianity. Already the leaders of the Old Party are going through the country preaching that the present difficulties are owing to the admission of the missionaries and the conversion of the Court. If this movement were to gather strength, Christianity would probably disappear over a great part of the country, and the people would relapse into barbarism. The British subjects whom I have met here complain bitterly of the fact that there is no English representative at the Hova capital, and they ascribe many of the recent complications to that cause. The evil consequences of this omission are twofold. In the first place, British commercial interests are necessarily neglected; and in the second place, when a crisis such as the present occurs, the want of diplomatic representation makes itself keenly felt.

In pursuit of their war against Almarine Samodu, the Sofa chief, they followed one of his head warriors, Kemoh Bilali, to that place. Captain Lendy, Inspector-General of the Sierra Leone Frontier Police, was sent up two months ago to watch their movements. Finding they had crossed British territory and had established themselves at Heremakous, he protested vigorously, and they promised that nothing of the kind should happen again; but they still occupy the town in force, and are building a fort there. A great many natives have gone over to them, among the number being Scyon, a great warrior, who is close to the frontier port now occupied by Sierra Leone police at Falabah.

There are doubtless other reasons also, which are deterrent. France had no very pleasant experiences in Madagascar and Tonquin to induce her to enter upon another petty war under even more adverse circumstances. There was further as recompense for trouble and expenditure in these two cases some hope of substantial success.

The market seems to be steadily supplied with just enough of what the natives want, which are being introduced by the old experienced merchants, but of course the general impression abroad is that there is nothing to be done, and there is consequently a complete lack of enterprise; but these old stagers are undoubtedly having a good time of it, as they have removed all timid competitors from the field, and get good prices for their goods. Vatomandry is momentarily over-stocked by certain merchants who speculated on a blockade and hoped to corner the market. The majority of the trading vessels that go in there are running from Tamatave for the account of several Mauritian firms in Tamatave. The problem has never yet been solved why the very nearest possible port to Tamatave, which is at the same time the nearest to the Capital has been left open, while more distant ports are uselessly blockaded. It is more than probable that the French had instructions from home to cease useless blockades, which only irritated the English, and did not in the least prevent the Hovas from introducing what they wanted into the island; especially as this was about the time that the numerous claims from British subjects came before the two Governments. Their amour-propre would of course not allow them to raise the blockades on places already closed, but it is to be remarked that since a certain epoch corresponding with the transfer of French operations to the North East coast, no more coast towns have been blockaded, and Vatomandry may have escaped just in time. The French may also have begun to understand that in trying to injure English influence the blows fall heaviest on the heads of the Mauritians. If Mauritius with its press was withdrawn from sympathizing and howling with France, the whole affair would very shortly die a natural death; for all the French together in Reunion would only be like a man howling in the desert. No one ever sees or hears of the French press of Reunion compared with that of Mauritius. It is to the interest of the French, then, to keep the Mauritians on their side, and that may be another reason for leaving Vatomandry open. Vatomandry is now an important trading town, and Mr. Pellicier is fulfilling the functions of British Vice-Consul. Mahanoro is now completely deserted; the greater part of the foreigners having emigrated North and South.

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago. And the French Ministry knows little more about it than the rest of the world. The popular belief has been that the Admiral on the West African station, and the military forces employed in garrison duty in the same district have tried to diversify their monotony by picking a quarrel. The account now published, if true, relieves them of the burden of such a reproach. Neither officers nor men have any inclination to force their country into speculative enterprises in such a region as the Slave Coast.

M. Etienne\'s speech in the Chamber of Deputies recently was a model of what a Ministerial explanation under such circumstances ought to be. This is not a case of more or less imaginary Kroumirs or Black Flags, whose depredations afford an excuse for an act of aggression and conquest. The King has repeatedly attacked the French stations on the coast, and although his forces have been repulsed, he declares he will not rest till he has driven the strangers out. Moreover, a French missionary and five civilians have been seized at Whydah and carried up the country, where, if not rescued, a horrible fate awaits them. All this points in only one direction, and Europeans may at any time hear that the kingdom of Dahomey is condemned to disappear as an independent State. That the Ffons can hope seriously to resist a French force is out of the question. Imbued though they are with savage ferocity, the Dahomeyans are no match for disciplined troops and machine guns. Indeed, of late it is affirmed that the reputation of the people for brute courage is no longer so well deserved as of old. But they are bloodthirsty and vindictive, and reckless of their lives when roused. They may give the French a great deal of trouble, and as women form the backbone of the Dahomeyan Army, it must be an unusually repulsive duty for the ""Grande Nation"" to enter into hostilities with them. Its Amazonian warriors and the bloody ""customs"" are the two characteristics of Dahomey which have kept it so prominently before the eye of civilisation. The country itself is of little value. Abomey, the capital, is situated about sixty-five miles from the coast. Whydah, the only seaport of any consequence, is the part of the kingdom with which Europeans are best acquainted. Here there are trading forts and ""factories"" belonging to the English, French, Portuguese, and Brazilians, which were places of importance during the days of the slave trade. Then the barracoons were crammed with human chattels, while the King was hunting down the neighbouring tribes in order to keep up the supply of that ""black ivory"" from which he derived such ample wealth. When this traffic came to an end, Whydah sank into insignificance, and is now simply a place of some 12,000 inhabitants, from which palm oil is shipped when the surf permits communications between vessel and shore.

The exploration had for its main object the location of the proposed branch line of the Great Sahara Railway, extending from Timbuctoo to the French military colony on Senegal, there to connect by steamer with France and to treat with the native tribes along the route. In both of these objects the mission seems to have been entirely successful. A treaty was entered into with the King of the Bambons, a powerful tribe scattered over the shores of the Upper Niger, by which, in consideration of some refuse artillery and a pecuniary annuity, the French gain the exclusive right to found factories, open commercial routes, &c., in all the empire of Sagou, from the course of the Niger down to Timbuctoo. They are granted, moreover, the sole right to navigate the Upper Niger, and to establish posts on its banks; and a French commissioner resident with a military colony will be located at the Bambon capital to supervise French interests in that quarter. This treaty gives France control of the whole valley of the Senegal, in the lower portion of which a line of factories and military stations is already established. It gives them also a clear route to the Niger and the Soudan, and anticipates any movement in that direction by England.

He also sent away his wives, children, and people to the opposite side of the lagoon, where he joined them that night. From a letter recently received from Porto Novo I copied the following extract: “The French have put up a notice calling the people home, but they have no faith in this. All they want is to see the country ceded to the British. King Tofa is now helpless utterly rejected by his subjects. But what can he do? To fight the Dahomians is quite impossible. He has no force to do this. The French, on whom he relies, make no move. To the British Government he cannot apply for fear of the French.” He has no fear of the Dahomians entering the town while the French are there, but the villages from which the town draws the chief portion of its food supplies are utterly defenceless. It would be a great pleasure to see the country in a more settled condition, the people dwelling in security and employing themselves in peaceful and prosperous pursuits.\n\nOld King Gelele of Dahomey is dead. He died, I have been informed, a year or two ago. For a long time this fact was kept secret, nor is the time yet arrived to make it public. Before his successor can be crowned he must distinguish himself by some signal success in war. Prince Kondo is the candidate, and is fired with the ambition to take Porto Novo or to capture the King. “All I want,” he said “is Tofa’s head.”', 'last_edit_date': '1889-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1889#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Paris correspondent of the Times forwards the following explanation of the causes which have led to the present complications between France and Dahomey:—\n\nIt is an error to believe that it is the soldiers and naval men of France who are the prompters to warlike action in Dahomey and would like to see the country entering on some conquest or coup de main. Of all desire for such enterprises Tonquin has cured them for a long time. They know too well the hardships and sufferings that are implied to echo the warlike wishes of the country. They know too well how many suffer and are worn out without recompense, how many have to struggle in obscurity after the conquest seems at an end, to encourage France with a light heart to enter upon enterprises of this kind so long as a really patriotic interest is not at stake. Henri Rivière was actuated by a personal ambition which urged him to adventures in Tonquin. This strange country, which it was thought could be conquered with fifty men, and which has not been subdued with 50,000, was more attractive than the miserable and deadly Dahomey. No; it is not the soldiers, not the seafaring forces, who favour an attack on Dahomey. You will be surprised when I tell you that it is the commercial houses established on the coast who desire to involve France in this enterprise, and who employ the most extraordinary means to accomplish their ends. It is not the first time that such things have happened. We have seen them in Senegambia and elsewhere at work in the same way. It is sometimes missionaries, sometimes employés on the coast, who have lost their way as if by accident in the interior, and who almost provoke their capture, who enable the trading houses to make a great noise and to call for the intervention of the mother country, and who involve it in a war of conquest. They do so because by this means their fortunes are increased a hundredfold, for a factory worth 10,000f. on a coast under savage rule is worth 1,000,000f. on one which has become French.\n\nNow, on the coast of Dahomey the most important business house is at the same time the one most skilful in pushing its interests by the most varied means. The firm is now Monte & Fabre, but in reality it is simply the old house of Régis, the first settled on the coast. Curious stories are told of its early doings. It is said that it began by collecting shells which the King of Dahomey used as money. Goods were purchased with them, about which statements are made which it would now be difficult to verify. In our time the shells are no longer used as coin, and the merchandise is one of a kind now difficult to remove. Accordingly the old house of Régis, young again in its successors, would not object to a change enabling it to carry on business not on Dahomian but on French territory, or on territory protected by France.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Recent Explorations in the Cameroons Interior', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In another column, our readers will find an account, given on the authority of the Paris correspondent of the *Times*, of the probable causes which led up to the late—or, shall we say present—difficulty between France and Dahomey.

African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

From that year, at the Congress of Berlin, Russian and British rivalries in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire brought the nations of Europe to the very verge of conflagration. European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia.

In these cases an explanation of imperialism will need to place more weight on disintegrative forces on the African side of the frontier, though without neglecting external factors. 32 The present writer agrees with most of the views of members of this school.$^{33}$ Like them, he explains the partition in both African and European terms, and therefore sees the African dimension theory as supplementing the Eurocentric theories already discussed. He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'European aggression on Liberian and Ethiopian territory, 1880-1914', 'content': 'Both Liberia and Ethiopia had enjoyed more or less amicable relations with the European powers up to 1879.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible.

We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

If Captain Burton will take the trouble to look at a map of Ireland—the only one I have at hand is Lewis\'s Atlas of the Counties—he will find that into Lough Neagh there flow the Main, a small \'burn\' rising to the south of the town of Antrim, the Six-mile Water, a small stream running into Sandy Bay, another rising near Lurgan, then the Upper Bann, and next the Blackwater, the Ballinderry, and the Moyola. Which of these, I should like to know, would Captain Burton choose for the source of the Lower Bann. Perhaps he will say the longest, perhaps the largest. In neither case, then, will the source be the Upper Bann. What remains but that Lough Neagh is a reservoir for the waters of a large number of mountain streams, and that it overflows into the Lower Bann, and is the real source of that river, in just the same sense that Speke named the Victoria Nyanza as the source of the Nile. Speke never supposed, as I said in my notice of \'The Nile Basin,\' that the Victoria Nyanza was a self-creating piece of water. All he meant was—as I understood him—that there was no great river falling into the lake, and that it was the product of a number of small, unknown streams, none of which could be said to be the source of the Nile, any more than any one of the mountain streams running into Lough Neagh can be said to be the source of the Lower Bann.\n\n""Captain Burton says, \'it is curious to find a critic,\' &c. No doubt it is very curious that any critic should have the temerity to differ with Captain Burton. It was my lot, however, to disagree on a small point with Captain Speke, and it is now my misfortune to differ on a greater question with his opponent. That opponent is so uniformly courteous to those holding different views—teste his insulting personal allusion to Colonel Rigby, in \'The Nile Basin\'—that I ought to feel humbled when I consider how I have dared to disagree with him. The \'Spekeian White Nile\' may, indeed, share the fate of the \'Brucian Blue Nile,\' but I may be allowed to think it will not be by the Burtonian and M\'Queenian arguments that this consummation will be secured. When somebody goes out and brings us facts, to set against Speke\'s facts, then the name of Speke may go down into the oblivion which Captain Burton desires for it.

Mr. Stanley said that he met with M. de Brazza in 1880 on the Congo, about forty miles from the lower station of the International Association, in a hopeless and poorly-clad condition, with a small following of men. Their appearance was not likely to have made a very great impression on the natives whom he might have met in his wanderings. When de Brazza started out he received 50,000 francs from the French branch of the International Association, 40,000 francs from the Secretary General of the Association at Brussels, and 10,000 francs from the French Ministry of Marine, making 100,000 francs in all. His wanderings measured about 1,080 geographical miles, out of which only 160 miles was new ground; yet his expenses averaged a little more than 74s. per mile. Compared with Livingstone, who journeyed 4,000 miles at a cost of 14s. 6d. per mile, and with Burton and Speke, who marched 1,800 miles at a cost of 29s. a mile, M. de Brazza had no reason to complain that his poverty-stricken appearance was due to the miserably small sum he had received. It was not to be supposed that King Makoko, of the Batiko, north of the Congo, had been so stricken with the genial manner of the great traveller and with admiration for the tri-colour as to strip himself of nine miles of his territory, with its villages and their inhabitants, and to give them to him for the establishment of a French station, in return for nothing more tangible than a promised protection of which King Makoko stood in no need. A few words unintelligible to the King, written on a slip of paper, by de Brazza, composed the deed of this strange transaction, and the surprise of the King could well be imagined if at some future period de Brazza succeeded in inducing his Government to recognise and put the official seal upon his acts. As it was, instead of the spirit of peace and goodwill breathed in this document, Stanley and his companions discovered the spirit of mischief abroad. De Brazza admitted to Stanley that he had been sent out by the same Society, and that the object of their labours was the same; yet after having constructed the Station of Franceville near the confluence of the Pass with the Ogowebay by means of International funds, he claimed it to be French territory. King Makoko had never ceded any territory to de Brazza, nor had ever given him the right to call any portion of the Batiko territory his own. He simply gave him permission to build houses that he might trade. Brazzaville had no existence in fact, and confronting its intended site was Leopoldville, the fourth station of the International Association, for which a substantial ground-rent was paid.""}, {'id': 4519, 'article_title': 'MR.

The _modus operandi_, the motives and aims are herein clearly set forth; and we think they ought to go down to posterity in our columns. Mr. Stanley, who was listened to with deep attention and loudly cheered, is reported to have said (in substance) ""that he always called the Expedition by another name than that of the African International Association, because at the time he set out in 1879 the funds of the Association were insufficient to meet the heavy expenses likely to be incurred. Funds were solicited by the King of the Belgians, and the new subscribers formed themselves into a body called ""Le Comité d\'Etudes du Haut Congo."" There were about twenty-five gentlemen connected with the enterprise, representing Belgium, Holland, France, and England. Civilising stations were to be established, and capital was furnished to be laid out by the community of whites in such a manner as would most benefit the native inhabitants. The Comité did not seek to be lords of the soil nor rulers of any portions of the land. The first station founded was at Vivi, though not before a substantial consideration had been agreed to be paid monthly to the five chiefs who ruled the districts. This station served as the base of operations. There began the great work of road making. By December, 1880, Isangila, fifty-two miles from Vivi, was reached, and the second station established. Between Isangila and Manyanza, the third station, the distance was seventy-four miles by river, but the stores and implements of the expedition had to be brought by a route two thousand two hundred and twenty-four miles in length. Before arriving at this station, in May, 1881, the severe strain put upon Mr. Stanley told upon his system, and brought him to the verge of death. On his recovery in the early part of July he started for Stanley Pool, along the north bank, being quite ignorant of what de Brazza had done there. After a march of several days Mr. Stanley was met by two negro sailors from the Gaboon, each carrying a French flag. After polite greetings were exchanged he was presented with two papers, one of which was called the Treaty, and the other an order to show hospitality to any white man who might enter the territory supposed by de Brazza to have been given him by Makoko. At Stanley Pool arrangements were made for another station, and by the 1st of February, 1882, a large edifice, ninety-seven feet in length, twenty-four wide, and divided into rooms for the European officers of the station, was completed. The fifth station was made by the beginning of April, and goods sufficient for two years\' consumption of the men at the station were stored away. Three hundred and thirty miles from Stanley Pool a lake was discovered, which proved after circumnavigation to be about seventy miles in breadth. On returning from this last excursion, Mr. Stanley was again stricken down with fever, and was reluctantly compelled to abandon the enterprise. He had, however, accomplished more than he had promised, and his success was greater than he had anticipated. He had encountered no hostility, and had every reason to hope that the stations so happily planted in Africa would more than meet the anticipation of all those who were concerned in the enterprise.'}, {'id': 4539, 'article_title': 'ITALY AND AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'ITALY AND AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': '12-06-1883', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1883#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_01_1883', 'content': '## THE CONGO COUNTRIES.\n\nPublic attention has of late been frequently called to the subject of the Congo Valley in connection with the much-to-be-regretted antagonism between Mr. Stanley and M.

M. de Brazza reached the Upper Congo by the Ogowe route before Mr. Stanley did so, making his way past the cataracts of the Lower Congo. The latter was seeking to open a permanent road, while the other merely made his way through without doing anything of the kind. M. de Brazza claims that the Ogowe route is the easier and the better of the two. As far as we can judge from careful comparison, there is, however, little to choose, either as to time or facility, between the two routes. In virtue of a treaty made with one of the native chiefs, M. de Brazza claims to have annexed three-fourths of the territory around Stanley Pool, and the French Government have ratified the treaty. As he went out, not as a political agent of France, but as a member of the Belgian International Association with which Mr. Stanley is also connected, the latter naturally feels that he ought not to have turned his journey to political account for one particular nation.\n\nWithout entering into the rights of this question, we would ask the friends of our Mission to join in praying that this difference between the two leading explorers of the district may not be permitted to cause war and bloodshed on the Congo, or in any way to hinder the progress of the Gospel.

M. de Brazza\'s object is to maintain and secure the position already achieved, by founding eight chief stations, connected with one another by twelve minor stations, which will form a double and uninterrupted route from the Gaboon towards Brazzaville by way of Ogone and Alima, and from the sea by way of Quilimon and Valle Niavi. In order to mark the pacific character of M. de Brazza\'s mission, it has been decided that it shall be carried out under the patronage of the Ministries for Foreign Affairs and Public Instruction. Towards the 1,275,000 fr.—the total estimated cost of the mission—the Ministry of Marine will only contribute 230,000 fr., a sum which represents the cost of transport.'}, {'id': 4591, 'article_title': 'THE CONGO AND THE ASSOCIATION INTER-NATIONALE.', 'full_section_title': 'THE CONGO AND THE ASSOCIATION INTER-NATIONALE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-11', 'issue_date': '02_04_1883', 'content': 'A correspondent writes to us from Brussels: ""The departure of M. de Brazza with his Expedition to the Congo, has, if possible, increased the great interest which is always felt here in all that pertains to the exploration and civilization of Central Africa. The latest correspondence received in Brussels from the Congo is dated from the middle of December. Mr. Stanley had already arrived on the coast, and had gone up the river as far as Vivi, the first of the stations founded by the Association Internationale Africaine. His party had been strengthened by 223 natives of Zanzibar, who had just arrived, under the guidance of the Belgian Captain de Cambier, the successful founder, in 1879, of Karema, the first station and habitation of white men on the great Lake Tanganyika. The negroes of the West Coast are so slothful and untrustworthy that Mr. Stanley, who made his first great journey across the continent with an escort of Zanzibaris, has ever since relied upon the assistance of these people in all his more arduous labours, and several hundreds of them have, at great expense, been transported to the Congo by the Association Internationale. At Vivi, the letters state that great preparations were being made for the construction of a railway between the station and the landing stage on the river. The difficulties of transport in this country, where there are no four-footed beasts of burden, are simply enormous. To secure a healthy locality, the station of Vivi was established on an eminence, at some little distance, about three-quarters of a mile from the river; and as it is the great depot for the stores and material of the Expedition, it is proposed to connect it with the river by a small portable tramway on De Cauville\'s system. The following stations have now been successfully founded—viz., Vivi, Isanghila, Manyanga, Lutété, Stanley Pool, Ibaka Nkotou, and Bolobo. The latter, which is some 700 miles from the mouth of the Congo, has only just been founded, and was reached by the steamer En Avant from Stanley Pool. Four small steamers have been sent out to the Congo, and of these three were already afloat last December, whilst the fourth was in the process of being transported from Manyanga to Leopoldsville, each separate section being necessarily carried on the heads of human bearers. The successful launching of these steamers on the open water above the great falls marks the accomplishment of the first part of the arduous task undertaken by the Association Internationale in their desire to open up the great river to the advance of civilization. The development of the stations which have been founded is naturally a work of time, but already they are becoming centres of civilization, and are exercising a strong and healthy influence on the natives in their neighbourhood. At Vivi, horned cattle, which were unknown in Central Africa, have been successfully introduced, and the great luxury of a supply of fresh milk has been secured to the station. At Leopoldsville special attention has been paid to agriculture, and fairly successful endeavours have been made to introduce the more useful of the European vegetables. Potatoes proved a failure, but cabbages, carrots, and lettuces thrive well, and are a great luxury to the staff of the Expedition, and to the missionaries, who are working under their protection and with their assistance. Mr. Comber, the head of the English Baptist Mission, who had been seriously ill, had, according to the latest accounts, quite recovered his health, and the reports also state that there was no sickness among the members of Mr. Stanley\'s large staff. So far, in spite of the enormous difficulties which have been encountered, there has been steady progress, and a few months ago even little anxiety was felt on the Congo as to the ultimate complete success of the great enterprise. The news which Mr. Stanley brought from Europe of M. de Brazza\'s ambitious schemes, and of the apparent probability of the recognition by the British Government of the Portuguese claims, had, however, caused some disquietude. With regard to M. de Brazza, the Expedition consider that the competition with him was of the nature of a race for securing by arrangement with the native chiefs the right of way and the most favourable sites for the necessary stations. In this race M. de Brazza is already distanced. At Bolobo the Association have reached a fertile and populous country far beyond the limits of M. de Brazza\'s former journey, and, with their men and material already concentrated, they feel confident of being able to advance too rapidly to be overtaken by the French Expedition. Unless M. de Brazza resorts to actual violence, his rivalry is no longer dangerous. The Portuguese pretensions are considered more serious, and if the British Government does not make stringent conditions to ensure free right of way and free trade, as also the security of property which has been purchased from the native chiefs, the labours of the Association Internationale may yet prove abortive, and both Mr. Stanley\'s expedition and the English missionaries will have to quit the country.""'}, {'id': 4606, 'article_title': 'The West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'The West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1883#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_05_1883', 'content': '**THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.**\n\n**THE CONGO.**\n\n**BONNY, March 15 (via Liverpool, per ss. Corisco).**—From information received here, it appears that from Ambriz to Gaboon the whole of the native places are in a most excited state. Mr. Cohen, the English Consul at Loanda, visited Kinsembo in Her Majesty\'s ship Swallow to inquire into some outrages on English trading factories. The ""palaver"" resulted in the King of Kinsembo being fined one ""custom,"" or a quarterly tribute paid him by the traders. Ambriz, when the steamer Corisco left, was almost entirely deserted, the merchants and traders making a wholesale exodus. There were but three European trading houses there at latest accounts. Ambriz is under the Portuguese Government, and the Portuguese merchants themselves had all left. It was said that the Portuguese authorities were levying fresh duties and taxes, which made it impossible to do business. It was expected that the merchants would settle at the adjacent northern territories, which at present are neutral.\n\nA Portuguese war vessel was permanently stationed at Banana Creek, the entrance of the Congo, whilst a British war vessel was at Boma, further up the river. The United States Consul at Loanda had gone up the Congo with the object, it was said, of seeing how far American interests were affected by the action of the Portuguese. The American Consul was acting on instructions received from his Government, and his destination was said to be Stanley Pool. From Ambriz to Landana, and from Landana to Gaboon, the greatest excitement prevailed amongst the natives. It was stated that the Portuguese had intended to annex the former territory, whilst the French were to place their officials in possession of all the district from Gaboon down to Landana, the head-quarters being at the last-named place. At each place the chiefs and natives had intimated their firm determination to resist to the utmost any attempt made to take illegal possession of their country. It was therefore feared that if any action of the kind were attempted by the French and Portuguese, the bloodshed would be terrible. The French missionaries had already extended their operations as far as Landana. The arrival of Count Brazza at Gaboon was being anxiously looked for, as the natives were of opinion that he would take aggressive action on behalf of the French.'}, {'id': 4634, 'article_title': 'Lord Mayo on the French Congo Expedition', 'full_section_title': 'Lord Mayo on the French Congo Expedition', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1883#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_06_1883', 'content': 'To those interested in the Congo question and the opening up of that important river for the purpose of trade with the interior of Africa, a telegram saying that hostilities are likely to ensue between De Brazza and Stanley, must rather have startled them. We know that the French gunboat Sagittaire is now in the Congo, and that it is without question that she has been sent to support De Brazza\'s expedition that started from Bordeaux in March last.\n\nIt is difficult to decide what Stanley can do against such a Power as France. There is no doubt now that the Government of that country intend upholding their intrepid explorer, but it is to be greatly deplored in the interests of civilization and commerce that two such Powers should clash, especially when the commerce of the Congo is only in its infancy. If real hostilities ensue the trade that now exists in the river will be seriously affected, and the natives seeing the all-powerful white men fighting against each other will not know who to trust. No doubt many natives are engaged already on both sides to carry out their bloodthirsty intentions.\n\nEngland, a passive spectator of such a conflict, will, from a trade point of view, be the largest sufferer, and I might humbly suggest that a couple of gunboats in the river would have a very pacifying effect on ""les braves Belges"" and ""la belle France,"" represented by M. de Brazza and the Sagittaire. It is a great pity now that the world of commerce, who have been made aware of the importance of the trade of the Congo, should be obliged to look on and see trade brought to a standstill, because of the animosity shown to each other by two of the most hardy explorers that this century has seen. If the French Government are really in earnest the Belgian International Association have little prospects for the future and it must remain to this country, as is, indeed, usually the case, to preserve order in the interests of commerce and free trade.'}, {'id': 4686, 'article_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'full_section_title': 'Universal Disturbance', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_10_1883', 'content': '\n\n""The world at large presents nowhere a scene of perfect calm. A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.'}, {'id': 4711, 'article_title': 'THE CONGO', 'full_section_title': 'THE CONGO', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'have ever since his return given him their assistance in the heartiest and most friendly manner. The King still looks favourably on his enterprise, and thanks to the careful avoidance of political intriguing by the expedition, all complications have been avoided. Twelve stations extending from the coast along the Quillo, or Kivilu, to Stanley Pool, and thence doubling back along the Congo to Manyanga(?) and Vivi have been established, and two whites left in charge at each station. A magnificent country has thus been opened up to commerce, and the ground so entirely cut from under the feet of poor long-suffering M. de Brazza that his journey to Africa will, I am informed, have been a mere promenade militaire, harmless enough, except to such of his followers as may have their lives affected by the climate, but with no practical results whatever, and not even the compensation of cheap glory. ""Up to the present,"" says Lieutenant Van de Velde, ""he has done nothing. He can and will do nothing, at all events in the direction of Stanley Pool, however long he may remain in Africa.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Van de Velde left the Congo, M. de Brazza, accompanied by twelve whites, was at the lonely and depressing spot which has been dignified by the name of Franceville. He was meditating an advance to Stanley Pool, but intended only to make a short halt there, and push on as rapidly as he could into the interior. There would not appear to be the remotest danger of a collision, unless in the way of osculation, between the fellow-labourers in the African field. The wind has been fairly taken out of M. de Brazza\'s sails by the prompt action of his ""dear enemy."" All he can do will not, according to Lieutenant Van de Velde, undo the work of Stanley, and already he has found it convenient to avail himself in a slight measure of Stanley\'s assistance. Quite recently, wishing to dispatch an officer (a M. Dolizi or Delizy, I believe) to Stanley Pool, he chose Stanley\'s route for the journey, and the officer started with Père Augouard, via Vivi, under Stanley\'s auspices. Several missionary stations founded at Stanley Pool are said by Lieutenant Van de Velde to be prospering, and the King seems to regard them with favour. Among them are the Baptist Mission, placed under the personal protection of Mr. Stanley, the Livingstone Mission, the Mission of the Pères du Saint Esprit de Gabon, and that of Cardinal Lavigerie.\n\nStanley is still very anxious to have the assistance of a few American officers. ""The Congo climate,"" said Lieutenant Van de Velde to me, ""is not nearly so bad as it has been painted. It is only dangerous to those who neglect proper precautions. I did so, and, as you see, I am going home invalided.

At present opinion is in favour of Mr. Stanley's claims, so far at least as the eastern shores of the Lake are concerned, his rights being based on treaties older than those concluded by M. de Brazza. It is very desirable that the Powers assembled in Conference should pronounce some decision on this point, in order to avert serious dangers to Congo commerce. If they do not, the Association is too weak to oppose France, which Power, despite all pretensions to freedom on the Congo, could easily divert trade to the Ogowe, which is excluded from the freedom of the Congo basin. How seriously France regards this question is evident from Baron Lambremont's report that France reserves the recognition of the extension of freedom of trade on the West Coast of Africa to Sette Cama until after the settlement of the territorial differences, although the majority of the other Powers wished to immediately advance the limit to Sette Cama. On this point, as on others, Portugal sided with France. This co-operation between France and Portugal, although checked in its efforts to restrict so far as possible the Congo basin, was again active in the sitting of the Committee mentioned just above, especially during the discussion on the duties useful for meeting expenses necessary to commerce. France and Portugal advocated duties on imports; but England, Belgium, America, and Germany resolutely opposed this, and finally unanimity was attained by a mutual agreement that imports should be completely exempt from customs for a period of about twenty years, when a new decision will be come to, if—Well, twenty years is a long time, where Africa is concerned especially.

For the last two years he has been working in silence, and hopes to reap all the glory of the enterprise for himself. Hence the nature of his preparations, and the opposition he offered to M. Crampel\'s plan. By various means M. de Brazza has managed to collect enormous quantities of food supplies, medicines, arms, and ammunition on the banks of the Sangha and the Oubanghi. He possesses rails, heavy guns, and portable boats, and he has recruited detachments of 150, 200, and 250 laplots (a sort of native militia of Senegal), whom he has brought by different routes to Brazzaville, where a small army of 1,200 men is now concentrated ready to march on Lake Tchad. Of this number, 600 Senegalese are armed with modern breechloaders. The contingent also contains sixty Europeans. The expedition is provisioned for two years.\n\nIn reference to this announcement, the following official note was issued by the French Colonial Office: ""A morning paper publishes a series of details respecting M. de Brazza\'s project of exploration on the Congo which exaggerate the importance of that undertaking. In order to reduce these statements to their proper proportions, it is enough to state that M. de Brazza is now on the march towards the upper reaches of the Sangha, where he will continue the work of exploration commenced by M. Fourcault. His bodyguard consists of only twenty riflemen; but, although he may find it necessary to employ other riflemen and porters, his force will certainly not exceed 200 men. It may also be stated that this fresh expedition is not of a nature to require more extensive provisioning than those of former years.'}]","[{'document_title': 'CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**CENTRAL AFRICA.**\n\n**THE STATION AT STANLEY POOL.**—The actual point at issue between the Belgian and French rivals who are at work upon Stanley Pool is described in some detail, and with much perspicuity, in a despatch of Mr. A. Cohen to the Foreign Office. Putting out of consideration for the moment any possible political schemes in contemplation by the latter Power, and making the rather daring assumption that nothing more is intended than a mere commercial enterprise, the competition narrows itself down to this: whether the access to the upper river and the interior of the continent shall be obtained by means of the station at the north side of the Pool or by that at the south. Only about eighteen miles of water separate these two settlements; but the difference between them is perhaps as great as between Dover and Calais. ""Brazzaville,"" on the north side, is a place of later establishment, and more remote than the Belgian station, from the recognized route up the Congo river. But then M. de Brazza and his pugnacious following have a means of access to their town through the Gaboon territory, by way of the Egouaii; and if these adventurers organize a regular colony, under military protection, at the Pool, it is supposed by many people that they will divert thither the bulk of the trade to that part of Africa, for the Egouaii has a continuous navigation, uninterrupted by cataracts or falls, which so much detract from the value of the Lower Congo as a trade route. On the other hand, Mr. Stanley, on the part of the Belgian settlers, is attempting to open up new routes along the Killoo and Kacongo rivers, so that he may also have a double means of access to the interior.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Scramble for Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We need only mention the islands of Fernando Po, Principe, and St. Thomé, as belonging to Portugal.

This brings us to Corisco Bay, with the small Corisco Island occupied by Spain, to which country, moreover, Stieler's recent map gives a strip of coast to the north of the bay. Here we enter upon the region where France has been so busy in recent years. Under the auspices of De Brazza and other explorers, the French have been not only opening up the interior and tracing out river trade-routes, but been among great stretches of territory as they went. How far their power extends in the interior it would be difficult to say, but by a sweep up the Ogové and down the Alima, they have at least a line of territory ending at Stanley Pool, on the Congo. Between the French territory and the mouth of the Congo, some 350 miles, the coast at present is chiefly occupied by petty native kingdoms, which will doubtless soon be absorbed, probably by France. Along this coast there are several small settlements belonging to various Powers; at Setti Camma are some British factories; at the mouth of the Kevilu are both Dutch and English factories; at Punta Negra is the station recently occupied by the French; at Chinchoxo is a Dutch factory; and just south of the last-named is Landana, which, with the adjoining territory, was placed under Portuguese authority by treaty with the native chiefs in December last.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the reports concerning Mr. Stanley\'s work on the Congo and the prospects of trade with the interior of Central Africa, as a result of the enterprise of the King of the Belgians, have latterly not been very encouraging, there is some reason to believe that Mr. Stanley\'s rival, M. de Brazza, and his companions are not proving more successful than the agents of the African International Association. This at least may be inferred from an account of the experiences of Henri Rochefort, junior, the eldest son of the editor of the Intransigeant. Young Rochefort (who is only twenty-two years of age), after twelve months\' military experience under the French flag in Algeria, obtained permission at the beginning of the current year to accompany the De Brazza Expedition. Of the forty other members of the expedition who left France, only ten are still with their leader; two are dead, and the rest are scattered over the country, entirely broken down in health. Rochefort was attacked with fever as soon as he reached the Congo, and has never since been quite free from it. M. de Brazza appointed him the head of the station at Loango, leaving seventeen Senegalese riflemen under his charge. At first all went well; but the Portuguese are said to have excited the negroes against the mission, and in the end Rochefort and his party had to sustain ""a terrible attack."" Victory remained with the French commander, but the lives of five of his men were sacrificed. The only other special achievement by Rochefort, apparently, was the rescue of thirty of the wives and as many of the slaves of a defunct native chief. These unfortunates had been condemned to undergo the trial by poison which is one of the rites practised on the death of a native, and which invariably results fatally. Rochefort and his men charged the tribe with the bayonet, but, strange to say, the intended victims, and particularly the women, were absolutely furious with their rescuers. Referring to the hardships endured by the expedition, the Figaro says, the truth is that De Brazza left home without money. The Franco-Italian explorer, it appears, laughs at obstacles, and is so absorbed with ""the spirit of conquest"" that he thinks neither of meat, drink, nor clothing. The fact that young Rochefort has returned in a state of extreme prostration, coupled with the ominous rumours concerning De Brazza himself which have lately obtained currency, suggests that the narrative from which we have been quoting is not an over-drawn picture of the experiences of the expedition as a whole. The mania for colonial empire which induced the French Chambers to recognize the absurd De Brazza-Makoko treaty seems likely, in this instance at least, to result in a fiasco.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1884#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Two events of the past month are likely to have a lasting influence upon the future of Africa.

Any one who has seen the two places must wonder why we did not accept their offer. The French were then desirous of consolidating their possessions, and for long after our refusal to treat for the exchange the work of exploration by De Brazza starved.\n\nThis exploration has led to the addition to the colony of the Gaboon of the countries between it and the Congo, which may soon offer an important field for trade, and probably contain a trade route to the equatorial and northern portion of the Congo, which will compete with that of Mr. Stanley. Our commercial relations with France since the abrogation of the Cobden Treaty have been such that we have been unable to safeguard the interests of our merchants in French possessions beyond the seas, but perhaps nowhere except in the Gaboon have English ships been forced to haul down the English ensign and hoist the tricolour before being allowed to trade in certain territorial waters! The French in the Gaboon have acted on a principle of exclusion, and though a portion of the territory is bound by the Free-trade rules, we may feel certain that the English merchant, though he may legally stand on an equal footing with the French trader, will find that his position is very different, and that many obstacles are put in the way of his competing on equal terms with his rivals.

Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent. The inadequate recognition in England of this movement may perhaps be attributed to a well-founded belief on the part of ""Our own Correspondents"" that the British public has lately had a surfeit of the Dark Continent.\n\nIt may seem illogical that the demarcation by other countries of spheres of influence in East and South Africa should affect the estimates which France had previously formed of the value of the regions bordering on her possessions in the north and west of the Continent; but it is not in France alone that the fever of annexation proves contagious. To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire.

The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

The General History of Africa highlights the cleavage between the Americo-Liberians and indigenous Africans, noting the Americo-Liberians' tight political control and restriction of political participation for educated indigenous Africans. This control extended to trade, where the imposition of trade restrictions and levies favored Americo-Liberian merchants, alienating both foreign merchants and indigenous African chiefs, leading to armed resistance from groups like the Vai, Kru, and Grebo. The annexation of Liberian territories by European powers further strained relations, as indigenous groups were discontent with Liberia's trade policies and lack of effective occupation. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize conflicts over land ownership, with tribes like the Grebo and Settra Kroo rejecting Liberian sovereignty and asserting their ancestral land rights. The imposition of export regulations, requiring produce to be exported through designated ports, led to resistance from native populations, as evidenced by troubles on the Liberian seacoast. The integration of foreign traders also fueled tensions, with hostility towards Sierra Leone merchants and challenges faced by foreigners in conducting business in Liberia.

The imposition of trade restrictions and levies by the Liberian government, which favored Americo-Liberian merchants, alienated both foreign merchants and indigenous African chiefs, leading to armed resistance from groups like the Vai, Kru, and Grebo. Additionally, the text discusses the annexation of Liberian territories by European powers, such as Britain and France, which further strained relations as indigenous groups were discontent with Liberia's trade policies and lack of effective occupation. The integration of foreign traders and the imposition of export regulations are evident in the government's attempts to control trade through designated ports and the subsequent resistance from both indigenous populations and foreign merchants. These details align with the claim, illustrating how land disputes, export regulations, and foreign trader integration contributed to tensions between the indigenous populations and the Liberian government.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that tensions between indigenous populations and the Liberian government were exacerbated by disputes over land claims, export regulations, and the integration of foreign traders. The articles highlight conflicts over land ownership, with indigenous tribes like the Grebo and Settra Kroo rejecting Liberian sovereignty and asserting their rights to their ancestral lands, as seen in their resolutions and repudiation of Liberian authority. Additionally, the imposition of export regulations, such as the requirement for all produce to be exported through designated ports, led to resistance from native populations, as mentioned in the troubles with the natives on the Liberian seacoast. The integration of foreign traders also contributed to tensions, with reports of hostility towards Sierra Leone merchants and the challenges faced by foreigners in conducting business in Liberia. These elements collectively illustrate the complex interplay of land disputes, regulatory impositions, and foreign trade dynamics in exacerbating tensions between the Liberian government and indigenous populations.",True,1500,Resistance and Conflict,Political and Economic Instability,"[{'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia on the eve of the Scramble for Africa Liberia > Liberia', 'content': ""More fundamental has been the cleavage between the Americo-Liberians and Liberia's indigenous Africans. Throughout the nineteenth century, Americo-Liberians' policy was to assimilate the indigenous Africans culturally and politically by 'civilizing' and Christianizing them, and giving them equal rights with the settlers. Although this was achieved to some extent with the Recaptives (who were much less numerous than the settlers), the Americo-Liberians, mindful of their own privileged position, main› tained tight political control over Liberia by restricting political participa› tion of even those indigenous Africans who were educated. Only very few of them were given the franchise on an equal footing with the AmericoLiberians (although these might themselves be illiterate and poor). The main indigenous African representation (mostly of the coastal Africans) in the Liberian Legislature as from 1875 consisted of African chiefs designated 'referees' (or 'delegates'), after their chiefdoms had paid an annual 'delegate fee' of $100 to the Liberian government. As the delegates 'spoke' through an interpreter solely on ethnic matters and could not vote, they had very little influence on government policy.$^{8}$ Hence both the educated Africans and the chiefs resented their restricted representation. Furthermore the Liberian government sought to maximize its import and export duties and other levies on trade and shipping which constituted its main sources of revenue. To facilitate collection and control of the external trade by Americo-Liberian merchants, from 1839 the government restricted foreign merchants to trade at only six Americo-Liberian portsof-entry. The restrictions and levies alienated both the foreign merchants who resented them, and the indigenous African chiefs who had formerly controlled the external trade and levied the dues. Often, the foreign merchants and chiefs combined to resist or defy the trade restrictions and levies, or to appeal to European states to intervene on their behalf. Thus, at various times during the nineteenth century, the Vai, Kru and Grebo of the Liberian coast put up an armed resistance to Liberian government impositions on their trade. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""Like its predecessor, this second commission drew up elaborate plans for the improvement of Liberia's internal administration, finances, and public health. In January 1932 the Brunot Commission also presented its Report to the League. Its recommendations were similar in many respects to those of the Christy Commission but less unfavourable to Liberia on the whole. Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved. The hinterland was to be divided into three provinces to be administered by foreign provincial and deputy commissioners under whom would be Liberian county super› intendents and district commissioners. The commission also suggested that for Liberia's finances to improve reasonably, Firestone would have to modify the terms of the loan agreement of 192o. 93 This intervention in Liberian affairs by the League significantly in› creased the opposition to the Liberian Government of many indigenous Liberians, particularly the Kru, Grebo and Vai. Many of them believed that the 'white men' would soon take over the Liberian government from the Americo-Liberians; hence they ceased to pay taxes or perform forced labour on public projects like road building. Simultaneously, some of them revived intra-ethnic conflicts over disputed boundaries, farmlands and chieftainships.\nTo maintain peace and order, President Barclay sent a detachment of the Liberian Frontier Force to the Kru and Grebo districts in May 1931 with specific instructions to its Americo-Liberian commander, Colonel T. Elwood Davis, that the detachment was 'a patrol in force and not a punitive expedition'.$^{94}$ However, in the course of the patrol, fighting broke out between the detachment and the Kru of Sasstown led by their paramount chief, Juah Nimley, which provided fresh grounds for external intervention in Liberian affairs.

The Scramble and partition forced the Liberian government to advance into the Liberian hinterland to subjugate the indigenous ethnic groups and establish a colonial-type administration over them.$^{64}$ Each administrative unit or district was governed 'in› directly' through its principal chiefs in collaboration with a governmentappointed district commissioner. Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921. These protracted wars on different fronts and the cost and inefficiency of the 'native administration' encouraged foreign intervention and strained the government's human and material resources. 66 The government's revenues were never adequate. Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade. Coffee, Liberia's major export commodity since the 1860s, was produced mostly by Americo-Liberian planters and entrepreneurs using both Recaptive and indigenous African labour.

A few of those thus favoured rose to prominent public or political positions, like Dr Benjamin W. Payne, a Bassa man trained in medicine in the United States, who held a Cabinet position as Secretary of Public Instruction for most of the 1910s and 1920s; Henry Too Wesley, a Grebo man, who was Liberia's Vice-President in the early 1920s; Didwo Twe, a Kru Senator (Plate 28.1); and Momolu Massaquoi, a Vai man, who was at various times in the 1920s Acting Secretary of the Interior and Liberia's Consul in Germany. 7\nNevertheless, even the favoured educated Africans - let alone the mass of unenfranchised and largely oppressed indigenous Liberians - were more or less dissatisfied with 'Americo-Liberian rule' - as they rightly termed the Liberian government. As a rule the educated indigenous Liberians sought to reform Liberia's socio-political system to secure a better deal for the indigenous Liberians. Only rarely, as in 1930, during the forced labour crisis in Liberia, did some of the leading educated indigenous Liberians actively seek to overthrow the Americo-Liberians and supplant them in the government. 8\nAcculturation was, however, not unidirectional. Over the years the Americo-Liberians had themselves adapted many aspects of indigenous Liberian culture which they had earlier abhorred or decried as super› stitious or heathenish, such as belief in the efficacy of magic, witchcraft and 'native medicine'; initiation into the poro; and the practice of pawning persons to meet a debt or other obligation.$^{9}$ The degree of such African› ization was, however, too limited to blur the main social, economic, political and cultural distinctions between the Americo-Liberians as a group, and the indigenous Liberians, by the terminal date of this study in 1935."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Foreign intervention in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': 'First, the Liberian government\'s penury and perennial indebtedness partly led to increased foreign control of Liberia\'s financial administration by the International Receivership, the Bank of British West Africa, and Firestone interests supported by the United States government.

Secondly, Liberia\'s unfavourable economic, social and administrative conditions became a major issue in the bitter political rivalry between the True Whig and People\'s parties and attracted considerable international attention.

The decline, since the late nineteenth century, of agriculture and trade which had provided many Liberians with means of livelihood, made the Liberian government the main employer of labour as well as the source of income and high social status for most Liberians.$^{24}$ Increasingly, therefore, it was important that prospective as well as incumbent holders of public or political office should support the government which was tantamount to supporting the ruling True Whig Party. Secondly, during the period 1915-35, perhaps even more than before, gross corruption and malpractices were resorted to in Liberia's public system and political processes. The keen competition between the True Whig and People's parties in the 1920s and early 1930s particularly exacerbated election malpractices, mostly by the ruling True Whig Party. At the elections of May 1927, for instance, President King allegedly polled 235000 votes, and his People's Party opponent, T. J. R. Faulkner, 9000 votes, whereas there were not more than 10 000 individuals entitled to vote throughout Liberia in that year. 25 Thirdly, as in the nineteenth century, the ruling and opposition parties were divided mainly by clashes of personalities or disagreements over the sharing of the social surplus and not by any marked ideological or policy differences. In 1911, for instance, the People's Party was organized by a splinter group of the True Whig Party as a consequence of Liberia's Vice-President Jerome J. Dossen of Maryland losing his bid for nomination as True Whig presidential candidate to Daniel B. Howard, the National Chairman of the party. Similarly in 1927, many True Whigs joined the People's Party not primarily because they favoured that party's pro› grammes, but because they opposed President King's bid for a 'third term'.$^{26}$ In the absence of major ideological or policy differences among Liberians, politics became largely a matter of collaboration or competition between the leading, mostly Americo-Liberian, families in the ruling or opposition parties to control the social surplus."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Liberia', 'content': ""In actual fact, the proceeds from the 'assigned revenue' fell after the outbreak of the First World War largely as a result of the contraction of trade which followed the withdrawal of the Germans who had controlled about three-quarters of the Liberian trade.$^{38}$ Furthermore, as the price of coffee, Liberia's principal export, and other Liberian products like cocoa, ivory, palm oil and kernels, and piassava fell drastically in the world market,$^{39}$ planters drastically cut production, so that Liberia's exports, and, correspondingly, the customs revenue, declined the more.

We have read it attentively, but we cannot find in it that dependable rectification of errors in King Weah’s statement, published by us last month, which we had looked for. Having received constant and minute intelligence from Cape Palmas, from the period of the advent of the Liberian Commissioner there, we discover that there are important omissions in the Report; nor are we at all satisfied that King Weah’s statements are incorrect as regards either of the two great points—viz., the commencement of warlike operations and the territorial claims. We are surprised at the failure of the Report on these points, because, if there be one thing more than another in which the public men in Liberia have excelled, it has been in the drawing up of their Reports, Presidential Messages, and other State documents; and still more surprised, because many portions of the Report are written with a most charming air of sincerity and good feeling, becoming the character and position of the Commissioner. The Commissioner states that there was a warlike demonstration of the natives on the 10th of August, and that on the following day some of them began deliberately to fire on the Hoffman Mission Station. He then adds: “Thus war began, as far as I know the facts.” As the Commissioner was at Cape Palmas at that time, he must have had a personal knowledge of the facts had they been such as he relates; and the impression produced on our mind is that, not himself believing the statement to be altogether true, he was too conscientious to vouch for it. Then as regards the Land question. The Special Commissioner states that the object of the combination among the natives is “the re-possession of the territory,” which involves rights and powers that would be incompatible with the fiscal arrangements of the Liberian Government; that the natives “deny that the Liberian Government has acquired the domain; that they declare themselves the masters; that they ignore the deed of purchase by the Maryland Colonization Society, and assert that the articles therein mentioned were paid to them for landing the immigrants and building their huts.” Looking to probabilities, we cannot believe that the natives sold the entire lands of their country, and their own right of free action, but only the lands on which they permitted the immigrants of the Colonization Society to settle, assisting them in landing, building their huts, &c. We must frankly state, however, that we do not attach much importance to this. Liberia has become an organized and recognized State, with institutions framed and established on the model of the United States of America.

The Volta left Rocktown on June 24, and the battle took place three days before. The Liberian troops numbered about 400, and the fight occupied the whole of the day. The Liberians retreated in the evening, and left the field in the possession of the natives of Rocktown. The battle really took place on the beach, between Cape Palmas and Rocktown. The Rocktown boys captured a brass cannon from the enemy and a white flag. It was difficult to get the precise figures as to the number of the killed, but it was believed that the Liberians lost about thirty killed, and the Rocktown boys about fifteen or twenty. The Rocktown boys turned the captured cannon on the Liberian gunboat, but the shots did not strike her. The gunboat nevertheless got out of the cannon's range. It seems that at one time the Liberians flew the white flag, but the Rocktown boys not understanding it fired into the ranks of the Liberians and continued the fight. Great excitement prevailed at Grand Bassa when the news of the defeat of the Liberians reached that place. The cause of the hostilities is that Liberia lays claim to Rocktown, and insists upon her laws and regulations being observed there. The Greeboes (the Rocktown natives) profess complete independence. The King of Rocktown asked Captain Rutherford to wait, as he was writing a letter to Queen Victoria telling her Majesty about the war. The Volta had about forty Rocktown boys as passengers, and most of them landed in their canoes, but before all of them could get away the Liberian man-of-war Gorronammah came up, and ordered her away, at the same time demanding that the Rocktown boys be given up to her.

Liberia, in its wide sense, means the Monrovians and the colonists of Cape Palmas; but, to give you a full understanding, you will note that the present war with the Monrovians and colonists of Cape Palmas entirely excludes the aborigines of the Monrovia territory; for Monrovia was first settled before Maryland County (Palmas). The former was settled in 1821, and the latter in 1834, and both became one in the war between the colonists and the aborigines of Cape Palmas in 1856-7. Whether the Americo-Liberians have bought the countries of the Kroos under the Monrovians, we cannot tell or have anything to do with; but we are after our native land, which they in pretence say they have bought from us.\n\nThe Liberians never bought our land, and neither do they conquer us by war.

Mission; they hate the missionaries themselves because they teach the Gospel.\n\nI wonder at what the Americo-Liberians used to say to the king of this place—that whenever they have any war with us they would doubtless receive assistance from the English, Americans, French, Germans, &c., to drive us away from the beach!

We are kept down in this place next to servitude; our will is not our own; a few men who are in command of a little property keep us knuckle down to them. If we are in their employment we are seldom paid in money, but are obliged to take up such estables as they choose to give us. If a captain or supercargo comes, and wishes to give some of the enterprising young men of this place a little trust, these merchants here, though doing business on trust themselves, will oppose it, and advise the parties not to give them trust. If any of us try to do a little trading whereby we may progress, we are opposed, oppressed, and all kind of stratagems will be used to prevent our success. Hence we are living here not in harmony and love; every man is opposed to the progress of his neighbour in whatever pursuit he follows; whether it be in the mercantile line or farming, it seems as a dagger driven into us to see any one else prosper; very few sympathise with their fellow-citizen when misfortune happens to him, and fewer still will give any aid except for a large reward. Even the immigrants who are invited by us from America to come and help us to build up this black nationality, when they come out, except they possess a little money, are looked down upon with disdain and contempt by the other citizens; any advantages that can be taken of them will be taken. Sometimes we may be paid by the merchants when we are in their employment in Liberian currency, and if without leaving the store we give them back the currency for the purchase of some article in their store, they refuse to take the very currency they paid us, demanding specie of us; and if they do take it, it will be at a discount; and when foreigners come here to reside among us to do business, whether they be our colour or white men, whereby we can get articles cheaper, be employed, and the country built up for our benefit, the majority of people are against them, and they will try everything in their power to entrap them in law-suits; they will go to their places of business, abuse, insult, curse and swear at them, and some of our young men, when in the employment of foreigners, will skulk away a part of their time in idleness; and if their employers bring them up for it they will question their authority in doing so, and begin to speak of their freedom, and demand full pay for the time they have wasted in idleness; and if the foreigners refuse to pay them they are taken to law and made to pay, for our laws, Mr. Editor, are all one-sided. No foreigners or new-comers expect to get justice in Liberia; if they do, they will certainly drain the pockets well first. Whether this is done from the ignorance of the people, or whether they are influenced by the few merchants here, I cannot say; one thing I know, that this is a practice in the Republic, to take all advantage they can of foreigners, that they may be discouraged and leave the country. I am a supporter of foreigners, for without foreigners we cannot live. America receives into her country immigrants of all nations. The Dutchman finds a home and welcome; he brings with him skill and science, and puts them in operation. The Frenchman, the Englishman, the German, and Italian find welcome hands beckoning them to come; therefore America has advanced to what she is this day. Why can\'t Liberia stretch out her hands to all nations, and invite them into her country? Why can\'t Liberia open her ""Constitution,"" and allow all nations to come in and build her up? Why do Liberians take advantage of foreigners and strangers, and combine together against them? These are the things that keep us from progressing. Since our Government was a Government it has been in an embarrassed state; never was Liberia able to redeem her currency in gold and silver, as she reports. These things can be easily remedied if better steps were to be taken, and selfishness and self-conceit put away.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-05-08', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-29', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LIBERIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sorry to learn that the Cavalla River is in a very disturbed state, and that the Liberian Government find it impossible to keep peace among the rival tribes, who are constantly at war with one another.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed Settlement of the Liberian North-west Boundary Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is a leading article in the Liberian paper, the _Observer_, on the North-west Boundary Question: ""We hope all the wiseacres are satisfied about the benevolent intentions of the English Government.

That Government now gives plain utterance to that at which its agents have been hinting a long time ago. The Liberian Government has not been wise in its generation. It has attempted to trade upon the supposed philanthropy of its rival, and it is likely to suffer in consequence. If Liberia does lose her northern territories, it is to be hoped that her statesmen will take to heart the lesson that from the day she declared her independence she was expected to have learned: that the era of philanthropy for her was over. She was to fight her own battles, look out for her own interests, stand up for her own rights. Failing to do this, she would suffer the consequences. Now in all the controversy about our North-west boundary we have blindly followed the path traced out by the English Government. We have done nothing that it was thought would offend. Their traders went into Mannah country. We enforced the laws they had ignored, were threatened with chastisement, paid an indemnity, saying we should protest, which we never formally did, and now we are told that we never protested—therefore it is an admission against us. Previous to the time of the Sulymah meeting, the English sent agents into the territory to collect evidence adverse to us, and paid for such evidence. We, although we had strong backers in the disputed territories, never made an effort to look after our interests and strengthen our case. Nor did we raise a single objection to the proceedings of the English Colonial Government. It might displease them; they would do right. Well, they have done right. They have cooked up a spurious claim made by a lot of exceedingly doubtful character, purporting to have been sworn in before magistrates influenced by traders known to be anxious for the acquisition of the country by Great Britain; and now they say, ""This is good claim; we must believe our citizens and our magistrates in preference to yours; give up the territory for the claim."" That the Cabinet was actually ready to fall in with the views of the English is heart-rending. Without animadversion, it certainly can be said with truth that they have disappointed the country. The protest transmitted by the citizens of Monrovia to the President truthfully points out the reason why we cannot accede without at least a struggle to the demands of the English Government. It would be but the beginning of the end. The territorial acquisitions which Great Britain contemplates making at our expense would practically place the northern boundary of Liberia at the St. Paul\'s River.

Pritchard, and the Government steamer Countess of Derby had sailed for Liberia, Colonel Cardew, the Governor of Sierra Leone, going with them. This was in view of reports of disturbances at Grand Bassa, in which British subjects had been seriously molested and their property destroyed. It was understood that the British vessels would go first to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where Governor Cardew would interview President Cheeseman, and then proceed to Grand Bassa. Reports credited at Sierra Leone stated that a club of Liberians had been formed at Grand Bassa, the object of which was to annoy and harass the Sierra Leone subjects in Liberia, with the view of driving them out of the country. The houses of two Sierra Leone merchants, Mr. Nylander and Mr. Reffell, were set on fire. That of the former gentleman was entirely destroyed, the Liberians surrounding the burning building and threatening to shoot any Sierra Leoneans who attempted to extinguish the flames or to save any of the contents. A notice was also posted up in the streets ordering all Sierra Leone Natives to quit that part of the Republic within thirty days, otherwise they would be killed by the members of the club. At the same time, it was said that the leading citizens had no sympathy with the perpetrators of these outrages, but, on the contrary, were seeking to bring the offenders to justice. There is no British Consul at Liberia, the Governor of Sierra Leone, which is about 300 miles away, acting in that capacity.

In a very few minutes after receiving the reply from England both vessels were on their way to Liberia. It is believed that this disturbance has arisen out of the agitation which was begun a couple of months ago against Sierra Leone merchants accumulating large sums in business in Liberia, and then returning with their earnings to their own country.

What has been already done by Liberians in sugar and coffee cultivation, and other branches of agricultural industry, is invaluable under these circumstances, as showing what an admirable field there is in Liberia for the judicious employment of capital under a settled government. There is a large aboriginal population ready for employment by those who may possess the means of payment for labour, not only in planting and securing crops, but in those indispensable accessories in new countries—the formation of roads, improving the navigation of rivers, and introducing that machinery which adds so much to the efficiency of manual labour.

Without that capital in the hands of the community, the government of Liberia has been, like the fabled Tantalus, surrounded by the life-giving element, but unable to appropriate it for its own use and safety. It has been suffering from a painful thirst of revenues which can only be supplied by the development of natural resources, and the opening up and utilizing land and water routes of communication with the interior, by means of which the produce of the soil may be conveyed with speed and at moderate cost to its sea-ports for shipment to the European and American markets.

The General History of Africa highlights the longstanding confrontations between the Asante and the British, beginning in the 1760s and including significant military engagements, such as the Asante's defeat of British forces in 1824. The British were particularly concerned about the revival of Asante power under Prempeh, who rejected British attempts to place Asante under their protection. This rejection, along with Asante military actions like the invasion of Nkoransa, Mo, and Abease, heightened tensions, leading to a British expedition that resulted in the arrest and deportation of Prempeh and other leaders. While the textbook focuses on the broader Asante-British conflicts, The African Times articles specifically address the unstable political atmosphere on the Gold Coast, exacerbated by perceived mismanagement by the Colonial Office and dissatisfaction among local tribes, such as the Fantees. The Ashantees are depicted as exploiting this instability, with reports of hostile intentions and military movements towards Fantee territory. Despite the threat to British possessions and interests, the British government was reluctant to engage in another campaign against the Ashantees. The articles emphasize the Ashantees' aggressive policies and their history of conflict with the Fantees, which directly threatened the stability and security of the region under British protection. Together, these sources illustrate how British political interests and the Ashantees' exploitation of political turmoil heightened tensions and the likelihood of conflict, particularly in Fantee territory, thereby threatening English interests.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding British political interests and the potential for Ashantee exploitation of political turmoil in Fantee territory.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Fortunately, Prempeh proved equal to the crisis with which he was confronted. Within three years of his succession, he was able to reunite the member states of the Asante Union (or Confederacy) and even to persuade the Dwaben to return home.

In reaction, the British offered to station a British Resident at Kumasi in return for the payment of annual stipends to the Asantehene and his other leading kings. Not only did the Asantehene reject this offer but dispatched a high-powered mission to the Queen of England 'to lay before your Majesty divers matters affecting the good estate of our kingdom'.$^{43}$ This diplomatic mission left Kumasi in November 1894 attended by over three hundred retainers. It entered Cape Coast on 10 December and left for England on 3 April 1895.

Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection. In spite of this, Prempeh, his mother who was also then the Queen, his uncles and some of the war chiefs were arrested and deported first to Sierra Leone and thence to the Seychelles Islands in 1900. 44 (See Plate 6.2.)"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858.

His vision encompassed the whole subcontinent, so that the Tswana, the Xhosa, Zulu, Ndebele and Shona societies all had to be annexed by declaring protectorates or by conquest.\nOf immediate and practical significance was Zululand, whose border disputes with the Transvaal could be utilized to manufacture a casus belli.

In 1856 Cetshwayo had gone some way towards guaranteeing the next Zulu succession for himself by annihilating Mbulazi, a possible contender, and his faction.

We are sorry to differ from our friends connected with the trade and commerce of West Africa, but there is nothing new in this position of ours. It is not that we differ in desire as to the results that should be obtained, so much as to the means by which success can be achieved. De omnibus rebus may be the endorsement on the Memorial in the archives of the Colonial Office; and we are at a loss to conceive how any great, real, and definite success could be thought likely to be obtained. Perhaps the exigencies of the position had something to do with this, as has not been unfrequently the case in the presentation of memorials to Secretaries of State. It is difficult to get up a deputation upon matters connected with a small Crown colony; there are so many prejudices to be consulted, so many opinions and feelings to be respected and conciliated. ""And if we go up to the Secretary of State, we had better point out all the changes such we think desirable and necessary,"" is the cry on all sides; and then a memorial is made to deal with so many points, involving multifarious changes, that there can be very little hope of results commensurate with the efforts made in arranging the deputation. This was the first thing that struck us on perusing Lord Derby\'s elaborate reply, which, as the Daily News\' report observes, was so full as to render it unnecessary to publish the text of the Memorial. And it had given great advantage to the Earl of Derby in framing his answer. It must be borne in mind that the Gold Coast Colony is a Crown colony, governed on the most approved Crown colony principles, which are to the permanent officials in Downing-street as sacred as were the Laws of the Medes and Persians, which might not be revoked. Well, the Memorialists attacked these Crown Colony principles, root and branch. They called in question the wisdom of the official decisions as regards the administration of the affairs of the colony; they stated that there ought to be two colonies, with separate administrations, instead of only one colony; they asked for a Resident at Ashanti (which involves war in the event of his ill-treatment by a barbarous state)—for arrange...\n[Jan. 1, 1884.]'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Protected Territories: State of Affairs Therein—Men and Things', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are at present, within this part of the Protectorate, two governments; first, we have the British, and next the Fanti Confederation.

In consequence of this, a vigorous trade is going on from this and Adda and Quittah, in salt, tobacco, gin, arms, and gunpowder, in exchange for gold dust and slaves.

Such a man, we hope, will see the necessity of something more than to be content that no invasion has taken place, or that it has been repulsed. It is not compatible with the dignity of the British Government, or with the duty of the latter to the countries under its protection, that the latter should remain liable to a repetition of the “Golden Axe” insult whenever it may suit a vain and ignorant barbarian to inflict it. Sir Samuel Rowe will, we hope, recognize the necessity, and make that necessity to be fully comprehended in Downing-street, that a definite line of policy must be adopted, and certain efficient measures be taken and maintained, as regards Ashanti and the other native States beyond the River Prah such as shall put an end for ever to the possibility of the recurrence of insulting threats, with their disturbing influence on industrial pursuits in the countries of the protectorate, and needless expense both to the Imperial and Colonial Exchequer. To give security to a country as well as to preserve peace and order in it, is one of the first duties of a sovereign power. This security the British Government must now give to the Fantee countries. We have made them dependent on us for protection, and we must make that protection efficient—not spasmodic, according to the varying humour of an insolent neighbouring barbarian, but constant and assured beyond the possibility of doubt. If it be said that the British Parliament, uninstructed by the fate of Old Rome, would not consent to any charge on the British Exchequer for any requisite measurer, then we say that the revenues of the protected territories, now not less than 100,000l. a year, are adequate for securing the interest on a public loan for the small amount that would be required. We have before contended that this revenue should be made available for guaranteeing railroads, and for other works of public improvement, that may aid in the development of the natural resources, vegetable and mineral, of those territories; but though we have the construction of railways there deeply at heart, we would postpone these and all other aids to industry in favour of that one great first aid without which all others are liable to fail in their object—security, perfect security, for life and property against the threat of barbarian invasion. We venture to hope that Sir Samuel Rowe will be the instrument through whom this great aid will be obtained. For ages past Ashanti has been the curse of all neighbouring countries. It was delivered into our hands in 1873-4 for destruction, and we failed in our duty, allowed it to be revived, and again to become insolent, and are now suffering the temporary disturbance of important industries, and compelled to incur considerable expense, because of that insolence.

He considered that the King of Ashanti was quite right in the view which he took of the matter, as he was practically barred from communication with the Coast. He characterized the course of the Government immediately after the transfer as a mistake which was likely to cost a couple of millions, besides many lives. He did not, however, think the English would be justified in abandoning the post, but thought the position gained by the English at the end of the present hostilities, if they are successful, would be beneficial, inasmuch as the whole Protectorate would be under one flag. Still, he preferred retiring from the Gold Coast to continuing the course of protecting a system of pillage and persecution. Had a proper policy been pursued, the English might have had a valuable ally in the King of Ashanti, instead of spending a couple of millions, besides lives, in fighting him. He believed that the proper course for England was to do what she had never yet done—namely, to use her increased prestige in putting down, with a high hand, all monopolies and obstructions to free commerce on the Coast.

The plot was discovered, and in 1863 Governor Pine refused further communication with the King until he withdrew his troops from the territory of the protected States and made reparation for the wrongs he had committed. Reporting to the Government at the time, he said: ""As the case now stands, the most I can hope is to drive the Ashantees from the Protectorate without the chance of administering that chastisement or demanding that retribution which is so justly due to its inhabitants—and remain in constant dread of subsequent incursions of a powerful enemy.""

What position too high for the man through whose brains had flashed this brilliant idea, who at the head of a Fanti army had done what no other Fanti force had ever attempted? What a glorious vista would be open to his ambitious glance! The diadem of Fanti only awaited him. A career of conquests would be open to him. He might found a dynasty, and it is just possible that in days to come the natives of the Gold Coast might also boast of their Caesar, Cromwell, or their Napoleon.

This advice is given in the face of the well-known deceptive character of the Ashantees, and of the fact that on a former occasion, when such exchange was proposed, although our Government fulfilled their part of the engagement, the King of Ashanti thought proper not to perform his, and of the fact that the messengers sent up to Ashanti by our Government from time to time have been and are still detained there; leaving out of sight the presence of the Ashanti forces in our Eastern and Western Districts.

It had, indeed, under the new aspect of affairs in the protected territories, consequent upon the late Ashantee war, the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee and the resolves of the Colonial-office, become an _absolute duty_ on the part of Great Britain to arrive at such an understanding with the King of Ashantee as should serve to place the relations between Ashantee and the kingdoms and tribes in the protectorate on the same footing as they were before the war. England having determined that she would not in future take part in any campaign against the Ashantees further than by affording some advice, arms, and ammunition to the Fantees and other tribes of the protectorate who might be involved in war with that people, it became indispensable to put an end to all existing causes of quarrel, which might otherwise afford a reason or a pretext for a new invasion. During the last year of the late war, the natives in the protectorate maintained on all occasions that it was not a war between them and Ashantee, but was a white man\'s palaver—a dispute between the King of Ashantee and the Governor of Cape Coast, through whom they were involved in it. We presume that it is on this ground the present administration at Cape Coast, in endeavoring to bring about pacific relations with Ashantee has thought it right and proper to conduct the negotiations without making the kings and chiefs parties to them. The proceedings have, therefore, we suppose, been, as our correspondent states, ""shrouded in mystery;"" and it appears the peace negotiations have been more protracted than the chief authorities at Cape Coast Castle had anticipated. Since we made the publication above alluded to, accompanied with a copy of the official proclamation, messengers and messages have passed and repassed between Cape Coast and Comassie, the latest messenger who lately made his appearance on the coast having with him a retinue of 100 men. What could this mean? Colonel Conran was so secret in his words and resolves that not the smallest suspicion of the real state of affairs seems to have been entertained. Suddenly, however, one ""Gaynin"" was arrested and secured, and it was made known that he was to be sent off to Sierra Leone by the next mail steamer, which was subsequently effected. At Sierra Leone he was to be allowed 1s. 9d. per diem for subsistence. This ""Gaynin"" was the chief alleged cause of the Ashantee invasion. He was a subject of the King of Ashantee, accused of having appropriated to his own use a lump of gold, all lump gold belonging of right to the King. Summoned to Comassie to give an account of this, he believed his life to be in danger, and sought refuge at Cape Coast. The King of Ashantee demanded him; the Governor refused to give him up; other grievances raised their heads; and the war ensued so big with results for the protectorate. From what has now occurred, it appears that the King of Ashantee, with the obstinacy which characterises the sovereigns of that country, has continued to urge the surrender of ""Gaynin"" as the absolutely indispensable condition of peace relations. This has, no doubt, led to the proposal by the Administrator of a medium course, namely—that he should be sent away from Cape Coast, his presence there being offensive to his late sovereign. We presume, further, that this more moderate course has been acceptable to his Majesty of Ashantee, and think it extremely probable that, as our correspondents suggest, the envoy with his escort of 100 came to Cape Coast that he might assure his master of the fact of ""Gaynin"" having been embarked for Sierra Leone.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Merits of the Ashantee War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under the above title, we have received the following from a most esteemed correspondent on the West Coast. It is valuable for history of the war, because it seems to show both sides of the question with great impartiality:—\n\n""The ostensible cause of the war is the detention by the British authorities of the runaway captain and eight men from Ashantee, who took refuge in the protected territory. The King of Ashantee was determined to have this man given up to him; but the conditions required by his Excellency Governor Pine, which were just and humane, the King of Ashantee was unable to comply with. Viewing the case impartially, one is led to conclude that both parties are justified in what they have done—the Governor for protecting the man, and the King for declaring war by crossing the Prah, the boundary of the respective territories.\n\n""The Governor is perfectly justified, because, according to the British law, a refugee who cannot be proved to have committed any crime, and who claims protection from our Government, cannot legally be delivered up to a tyrant or a despotic Government, where will is arbitrary in actions. It is well known that the life of these men, if they had been delivered up, would have been sacrificed. No sooner would they have crossed the frontier, than their heads would have been taken off and sent to the King of Ashantee at Comassie. No mercy would be shown to them, and no promise of sparing their lives that might be made to the Governor would be worthy of the least consideration.\n\n""The King is right in declaring war, because—\n\n""Firstly, the very throne on which he sits is at stake. Should he not have acted promptly in this affair, his people would have branded him as a coward unworthy to occupy the stool of the long-famed and brave Kings of Ashantee.\n\n""Secondly, should he have allowed the refugees to remain quietly with us, without making any demonstration regarding them, more important men would also have soon crossed from his territory to seek protection and security under the quiet rule of our Government. It behoved the King, therefore, to show that they could not do this with impunity.\n\n""Thirdly, the peaceful traders of the King of Ashantee had, before there was any commencement of war by him, been molested by the Fantees, their goods seized, and the men themselves put in irons. They were only released by order of Governor Pine, and no compensation was given to them.\n\n""Fourthly, the King of Ashantee\'s generals and captains will, on such an occasion, swear the great oath—viz., that the King has received an unpardonable insult, and that they are determined to avenge it.

The interactions between these groups and European powers, notably the British and French, are evident in trade, governance, and territorial control discussions. The articles detail the impact of colonial policies, such as the British free trade policy and the French protective system, on local commerce and social dynamics, alongside conflicts and cooperation among local tribes and between local leaders and colonial administrators.

Further south it was a different world, that of Upper Guinea, where decentralized farming peoples, speaking mostly West Atlantic languages, had long occupied the sea coast. From Monrovia to the Gambia, the Sudanic zone only began to have contacts with the sea coast in the eighteenth century. This region was also one of the earliest centres of European influence in Guinea-Bissau, home of Creole culture, and later Sierra Leone and Liberia. Like Senegambia, this region was important for the slave trade in the sixteenth century, though, in the eighteenth century, its role declined.\nOutside the coastal area, the two most important peoples were the Mandinka and the Fulbe (Fulani, Peul). The Mandinka empire of Kaabu (Gabu) dated back to the thirteenth century and had been independent of old Mali since the sixteenth. The Fulbe had been in the area since at least the fifteenth century but had founded the Muslim state of Futa Jallon only after 1727.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, Portuguese influence was in decline, but the clandestine slave trade was to continue for quite a time on both sides of the anti-slavery centre of Sierra Leone. Mandinka Kaabu had trouble maintaining its influence as far as the southern shores of the Gambia, and failed altogether with its former vassals the Ba'inuk, on the coast. The Foa (Balanta), non-centralized peasants, destroyed the Ba'inuk capital in 1830, and most of the survivors joined the Mandinka or else the Joola (Dyula), the hardy 'anarchic' traditionalist rice-growers who occupied the whole coastal area to the north. In the east, the Fulbe of Futa Jallon dominated the Mandinka as far as the Gambia in Kantora. In Kaabu and its dependencies, a Fulbe minority was growing increasingly impatient with its subordinate position.\nAt this period, the French set up trading posts in the Casamance, at Karabane in 1836 and then at Seeju (Sediou) in 1838. The groundnut trade soon grew, with predictable economic and social consequences. 4"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of Senegambia and Upper Guinea', 'section_title': 'Senegambia', 'content': 'Senegambia$^{2}$ is the only region where the old Western Sudanic cultural area (characterized by large states with a substantial Muslim minority) made contact with the Atlantic coast, that is, a zone where the corrosive power of Europe had been at work for centuries, mainly through the slave trade to the Americas. The Sudanese and Muslim character of these societies made them more stable than those of the Gulf of Guinea, but they were nevertheless deeply affected by changes in the external demand for their products and people. The slave trade from this region had been declining since the 1760s, with a brief increase in the 1780s. Neither the legal abolition of the British slave trade in 1808 nor the effective en› forcement of the French anti-slave-trade legislation in 1831 niade much difference to a trade that was already declining but nevertheless continued in a small way in various disguised or illegal forms until the 1850s. The more important economic change was the enormous increases in the prices offered for Senegambian products. By the 1830s, the annual average value of gum exports was already more than five times the value of slave exports at their peak, and alongside the revived gum trade were remarkable increases in the export of gold, hides, ivory, and beeswax, with the ground› nuts that were to be the major export by mid-century also beginning to make an appearance. 3\nThese changes in foreign trade made enormous differences in the local economies as well, shifting income from those who had once profited from the slave trade to new groups who were in a position to profit from the new production. From the late eighteenth century, and for reasons that were at least partially independent of the European factor, Islam began to gain a new dynamism; The peasantry began to convert en masse, partly as a form of protest against the aristocracy that was seeking to profit from the new economic currents by raiding the peasantry rather than protecting it. Senegambian societies thus found themselves caught between two new forces, a newly aggressive Islam and the new economic influences of a world economy being overturned and remade by the forces of indus› trialization.

At the level both of the state, of the nine largely independent provinces (diwal) that composed it, and of the 'parishes' (missidi, each comprising a 'noble' village and many farming hamlets), a haughty, self-confident class was in command. The defeated subjects, especially former Jallonke (Yalunka), had been oppressed to the point of losing their language, and their ranks had been swollen by imported slaves. Making up at least three-quarters of the population, they were closely supervised and harshly exploited. Between the strata of this harsh society, there were marginals, outcasts virtually without the law: in particular, poor Fulbe lineages that had not managed to seize estates during the war eked out their existence on meagre herds in the gaps between missidi. On the credit side, there was a remarkable spread of Islamic culture, accompanied by (as was rare in sub-Saharan Africa) frequent use of Fulfulde in written form. Though highly cultured, the aristocracy marked itself off by stockbreeding and warfare and also by certain forms of adventurous trade. The cultural tradition that underlay the political structure remained alive, and was local› ized in the diwal of Fugumba, whose marabouts decided political disputes by consecrating the almamis ('imams' - successive rulers of the state).\nBut the Fulbe did not monopolize religion; they even entrusted a prestigious role to outsiders regarded as neutral. These were an ethnic minority with whom we are already familiar, namely the Jaxaanke (Dyakhanke), who had, since the sixteenth century, covered first the Gambia and then the Futa and the Rivers with their commercial ventures. These western Joola (Dyula) were first and foremost men of religion, and in principle non-violent. In the Futa, in addition to long-distance trade, they had become the masters of religious culture since founding Tuba, near Labe, in about 1810.

Mandinka and Fulbe lineages settled everywhere, became pol› itically dominant and introduced new ideas of politics. Egalitarian, rela› tively unstratified societies thus came to accept organization into warrior chiefdoms and semi-centralized states.

This phenomenon covered essentially southern Susu country and the domains of the Limba, Loko, and Temne. It stopped short abruptly at Sierra Leone, that is, on the verge of the forest lands of the south, which had mainly stayed closed to the Sudanic trade routes. But major social effects extended well beyond that. Thus, from the Temne to the Kpelle of Liberia social and political life was dominated by great initiation societies, the best known of which, that for men, was often called Poron (compare the Poro of the Senufo).$^{8}$ Hence, this was a basic social phenomenon transcending the borders of the historical areas just defined.\nThe Loko, the advance guard of the Mende, were isolated between the Temne and the Limba with their backs to the sea.

Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses.

The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ...

That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

At the other extreme were the Kololo immigrants, who established their ascendancy over the Manganja, but were totally absorbed into the sub- ordinate society.$^{91}$ Between these two poles were the more common examples of cross-fertilization leading, in some cases, to the formation of syncretic cultures. Even the vanquished Kololo left their impact on the Lozi, who adopted their language and important governmental institutions.$^{92}$ Within the Mpezeni kingdom, on the other hand, all the political elements of the new society were of South African derivation while non-political cultural elements such as land inheritance, marital patterns, female circumcision and language were heavily influenced by the indigen› ous Nsenga tradition.$^{93}$ This bifurcation is not surprising since the Mpezeni kingdom was controlled by political and military institutions designed to ensure the pre-eminence of the Nguni. Spatial and demographic con› siderations seem initially to have determined the extent of cultural bor› rowing within the Mbwela Nguni state; in the core of the kingdom where the Nguni were more numerous, the Tonga and Tumbuka adopted most aspects of the alien culture, but towards the outlying provinces the rate of borrowing diminished proportionately. This general pattern is complicated somewhat by the Nguni adoption of Tumbuka as the national language and the subsequent Tumbuka cultural renaissance, which suggests that many of the subject people only superficially adopted Nguni culture. 94 Although a discussion of the effects which the Mfecane had on the existing patterns of social stratification is conspicuously absent from the literature, fragmentary evidence suggests the growth of new classes within the Nguni kingdoms. During the expansive phase, a military aristocracy consisting of the regimental commanders and their principal subordinates emerged. Their power was based primarily upon the tribute and plunder which they acquired - especially the herds of cattle and captives, some of which they redistributed to their followers.

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects. It succeeded so well that the magistrates and merchants returned their thanks to the rev. gentleman for his kind suggestion to the people. The people are also, to this day, grateful to him and to his local brother, their own countryman, whose son is now in London, sent by his countrymen to study for their further welfare.'}, {'id': 3019, 'article_title': 'The Bathurst Letter, Signed ""A Member,"" Published in Our September Number', 'full_section_title': 'The Bathurst Letter, Signed ""A Member,"" Published in Our September Number', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1876#article-0', 'issue_date': '01_01_1876', 'content': 'Bathurst, River Gambia, Oct. 16, 1875.**'}, {'id': 5276, 'article_title': 'THE GAMBIA BLUE BOOK.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GAMBIA BLUE BOOK.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_12_1885', 'content': '**Manufactures, Mines, and Fisheries, &c.**—Manufactures are varied and most primitive; the cloths of the country, as specimens of weaving and dyeing, are the most advanced proofs of locally developed skill.

It was really the cessation of the slave traffic that brought about the downfall of our prosperity in the Gambia, for it does not grow the oil palm; and ground nuts, now its chief article of export, were not sufficiently in vogue during the first quarter of this century to supply the place of slaves as a source of profit; and the Gambia has remained a restricted and not very valuable British possession, our actual rule being confined to a very small area, just at the mouth of the river, and one or two islets in its middle course.

The raids are said to have been made by the warriors of Chief Beram Cissey, who himself headed the marauders. The first descent was made on the town of Jayed, a place about 300 yards from the River Gambia. After plundering the place the invaders set it on fire. As many as could fled from the city, but several fell into the enemy's hands, including five subjects of British Bathurst. The persons taken were led away into captivity. All the establishments of the traders were plundered and much booty obtained. The fugitives fled towards the River Gambia, and many of them were here picked up by a trading cutter. The poor people were almost naked when found on the banks of the river. The town of Toro was also destroyed by Cissey and his followers. It was stated that the interior of the country had been in a disturbed state for some time, war raging incessantly between the rival chiefs until the belligerents had gradually come to the sea-board. Some of the chiefs, it is said, received annuities from the British Government, with which they are stated to have purchased ammunition to carry on the hostilities. It appears that these troubles had arisen in the kingdom of Badaiboo. We hear that on the death of King Maba, his son, Saida Matee, should have succeeded to the throne, but his authority was usurped by his uncle, Mahmoud Derry Bah, the Regent. Civil war ensued, with the result that Saida Matee was defeated. The fugitive Prince after burning and laying waste all his domains in his flight has, it is supposed, gone to seek the aid of Latjore the deposed Monarch of Cayor, who has nevertheless a number of followers, and a severe struggle for supremacy may be expected, the power of Said Matti being crippled but not destroyed. What is most surprising in the flight of Said Matti is the celerity with which he made his retreat out of the kingdom without even a battle to decide his fate. It is supposed, however, that at the most critical moment he was deserted by his most powerful vassals who it is reported went over to the invaders. And it is quite possible that he may make another effort to recover his lost position. Until lately the action of the Administrator of the Gambia (Captain Moloney) was confined to the giving of good advice and to offers of mediation. When one of Saida Matee's stockaded towns were recently captured, the victors not only burnt the place but pillaged the goods of British subjects, and the latter in consequence fled to Bathurst for safety. The Administrator at once left for the seat of war in the hope of being able to obtain reparation, as well as to prevent all danger of hostilities extending to British territory. The Administrator's mission appears to have been completely successful, as in an interview with Mahmoud Derry Bah he succeeded in extracting from that chief a promise that the claims of the plundered traders should be satisfied. A Board, consisting of Mr. Richards, the chief magistrate at Bathurst, Mr. J. R. Maxwell, the Queen's Advocate, and a native merchant, was engaged in investigating these claims, so that compensation might be demanded only for such as were shown to be well founded."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1885#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The political horizon of British Gambia is by no means in a satisfactory state; clouds are gathering from a quarter which ordinary men regard as a menace to the peace of the river.

He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony.

These particular and personal interests have grown up under British rule in the Gambia, and are the only ones on the West Coast of any importance that would be jeopardized or interfered with by the contemplated transfers. The British free trade policy, which has opened the ports of all our settlements and colonies to foreign commerce, differs so essentially from the French protective system, under which, as at the Senegal, for instance, all possible British competition is prohibited, that the British merchants having establishments on the River Gambia—establishments, some of which were founded more than half a century ago—are very naturally apprehensive that in coming under the restrictive French colonial system, instead of the liberal British one, their interests will be seriously jeopardized; or, in brief, that they would very soon be driven out altogether from the Gambia as a French colony or settlement. We cannot say that these apprehensions are unfounded, and we have therefore not been at all surprised to find that the British merchants having establishments on the Gambia have been holding private meetings in London, during the past month, for mutual counsel and agreement as to the best course for them to pursue for their own protection in this emergency. We sympathize with them, and do not hesitate to say that it would be unjust on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to make the proposed exchange without some stipulation that shall protect their absolute interest. As we are strangers to their counsels, we have not heard what is their estimate of these interests, or what special course of action they may have decided to adopt in defence of them. We have, however, a very decided opinion of our own in the matter, and that opinion we shall unreservedly express. First, then, we think they will be very unwise if they adopt the course of opposition to the Imperial policy in this matter, either on Imperial grounds or on the grounds of any supposed rights that the Native populations in the Gambia may have to a continuance of British rule in their countries. These are questions with which as British merchants they have not any concern. Like all other British subjects, they may express fully and freely their opinions respecting them, but they will not be wise if they do more. Their opposition to the Imperial policy would necessarily have little or no weight, because it could not be separated from, but would infallibly be regarded as influenced by, personal considerations. We helped them in 1869-70 to fight the battle against the transfer of the Gambia to the French, on Imperial grounds, because the transfer, as then proposed, was motived by considerations unworthy of such an empire as that of Great Britain, and certain to bring upon her an enduring disgrace. The motives of Government action are, however, at the present time essentially different. It is no longer a question whether ten or twenty thousand pounds a-year can be saved to the Imperial exchequer by getting rid of the Gambia. That economy was made without getting rid of it. We cannot, therefore, as we stated last month, fight the battle over again on such grounds, because they no longer exist. The considerations that influence us ought also to influence the Gambia merchants on this point. We insist the more on this because we have heard that merchants not connected with the Gambia trade have been active in tendering their co-operation and support to the Gambia merchants in opposing the Government on these Imperial grounds. They have real or fancied interests of their own involved, no doubt, in the projected exchange of settlements; but their interests are not in any respect the interests of the Gambia merchants, who will do wisely to leave them to pull their own chestnuts out of the fire, if they have any that seem likely to be burned there; and decline the proffered aid which, if accepted, will weaken instead of strengthen their position. Their true policy seems to us very clear. It is that they should not oppose the Government views, which are supposed to be now based on Imperial considerations of sufficient weight to justify the Government in entertaining them. Their acquiescence or non-acquiescence will not eventually influence the Government decision. What they have a just right to ask, and should energetically and persistently ask, is that they should not be sacrificed to those Imperial considerations which may justify Her Majesty’s Government in exchanging the Gambia for the relinquishment by the French in favour of Great Britain of their settlements and interests on all other parts of the West Coast of Africa. The Gambia merchants have invested large sums in buildings and other immovable property, in the belief, which they were in every respect justified in entertaining, that the British settlement on the Gambia was a permanent one. The giving up by Great Britain of any settlement it has once formed is an event so extremely rare that there could not be any possible reason why the future cession of the Gambia to some other Power should have been at all contemplated or considered by them. There is not anything therefore in their position at the Gambia to diminish the force and justice of their claim, that in any arrangements made by the British Government with that of the French for the cession of the Gambia to the latter, their interests should be scrupulously guarded and preserved to the fullest extent of their pecuniary value. We have no doubt it is tolerably correct that it would be impossible for them to live and continue their trade at the Gambia as hitherto, when French authorities and laws shall have superseded those under whom and which they have hitherto lived and carried on their commerce. The cession of the Gambia to the French involves therefore their eventual ejection from the settlement. If they remain there striving against the new and adverse circumstances after the cession, and those circumstances act so prejudicially to their interests as they seem to us to be fully justified in believing that they will act, they might be forced into parting with their properties to French merchants at almost any price that the latter might choose to give. They are justified therefore in demanding of Her Majesty’s Government that they shall not be subject to any such contingency, but be so placed under the new rule and laws that, should the prejudicial results which they fear really follow, they may be able at any time to leave the Gambia and receive the full present value of their properties. It is not necessary for us to point out to such practical men as they are how this might be arranged for without any actual loss or burthen to the French Government. It might certainly be so arranged that should the change result adversely to them they shall receive the full present value of their properties; while at the same time they should be left free to realize as much more for these as they might be enabled to obtain.

In 1861 he was an unimportant chief in the kingdom of Baddiboo, against which the last great war expedition of the British authorities in the Gambia was directed. Maba was a bigoted Mahometan, and watching his opportunity, he in 1861 rebelled against the King of Baddiboo, whom he put to death, raising himself to be supreme ruler of Baddiboo. He then declared a propaganda of Mahometanism, which he endeavoured to force by fire and sword in all the adjacent countries. His last recorded exploit was a successful attack upon some 300 French troops (Europeans), who were all slain except nine, the officer in command putting an end to his own existence.\n\nThe last French mail from Senegal brought to Europe the intelligence that this restless and cruel fanatic chief has at last met with the fate he has constantly provoked. He was therein stated to have been taken prisoner in battle by the Joloffe King of Sein, and by him put to death, his head and hands being sent by the Joloffe King to the French Governor of Senegal.\n\nBy the mail of the 2nd inst. from Bathurst we have a confirmation of this important news. As we are not of those who believe that the forcible spread of Mahometanism in Africa (and it never spreads in any other way) is desirable, we unfeignedly rejoice that this great warrior-chief, for such he undoubtedly was, exists no more to trouble the Gambia countries. He has interfered very much with the development of the ground-nut cultivation, on which the trade in the Gambia chiefly depends, and many British traders up the river have suffered severely in the troubles he was constantly exciting, and the wars he was as constantly waging; and we hope now to hear of a new era of trading prosperity there which may compensate them for their losses, and promote the spread of civilisation in those important countries. In this case we feel certain the British authorities will again find it necessary to place a small force at M'Carthy's Island, the former British outpost in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1867-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1867#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BATHURST, GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Without any uncertainty, we would state, in contradiction of Mr. Lee\'s observation, that the people of this settlement have no inclination whatever, and are directly opposed to the opinion, for more reasons than one, that the Gambia should be restored to its former system of separate government.\n\nThis novel idea of separation was first expressed by a member of our Legislative Council, who suggested to a member of the Gambia Native Association, about three months ago, a memorial on the subject to the Right Honourable the Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies; but the suggestion was so opposed by the Association in behalf of the general public that nothing more was ventured further upon the subject. It was even suspected that, like a late memorial against the establishment of a Government school in this settlement, some clandestine efforts might be put forth to move the Government to adopt the system of separate government, and the Association has been watchful lest such a circumstance should transpire.\n\nIf the Gambia be made a separate Government, it will be indispensable to appoint a Governor-in-Chief and Chief Justice; thus the staff of our Government, which is already proclaimed numerous, will be increased along with its expenditure. It is true that the Gambia is not poor, possessing as it does about £25,000 in the hands of the Crown Agents in London. But although it took Dr. Gouldsbury six years of efficient labours to accumulate this amount, yet it does not appear, from the unnecessary expenses the Government is now undergoing, that the settlement will ever be in position to meet the increased liability which a separation must inevitably entail.\n\nWe cannot speak much in favour of Captain Moloney\'s administration. To us it appears that his advent here was an importation of troubles, losses, and depression of trade. Dr. Gouldsbury\'s administration was a marked one. It effected so much improvement in the settlements, privately or publicly, that it can never fail to find a high place in the history of the Gambia. Already the cry is heard in Bathurst, it resounds in the interior of the Gambia, ""Dr. Gouldsbury is wanted! It is he that should be here at the present crisis."" Like Sir Samuel Rowe, it is acknowledged that Dr. Gouldsbury knows how to go about natives, and how to establish peace among them. We are of opinion that, should Dr. Gouldsbury be ordered out here for the space of two years, he will, without much cost to the Government, re-establish peace among the natives, and do all things tending to improve and extend trade; and in case the Home Government should decide upon separating the Gambia from the Government of the West Africa Settlements, we earnestly hope that Dr. Gouldsbury, or some other experienced competent individual, will be appointed to the office of Governor-in-Chief.—Believe me, Mr. Editor, yours sincerely,', 'last_edit_date': '1886-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1886#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.595, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Wars among the Natives of the River Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Our informant, to whom we have alluded in our notice of the River Gambia, on our second page, writes in substance as follows, relative to those wars among the natives of the Gambia Districts, to which we have more than once alluded, and which have been generally represented as resulting from a Mohammedan propaganda by fire and sword:—\n\nAccording to his version, the origin of this disturbance is to be found in the mismanagement of the late British war against the kingdom of Badiboo; and, therefore, that what seems now to occupy almost exclusively the heads, hearts, and hands of the Government, is traceable distinctly to their own acts. He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'History of Changes in the Gambia Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—It is now a very considerable time since we have written you on matters concerning the Gambia; but as opportunity affords we will enter the lists and aid our friends who have been furnishing you with reports of the state of things which has assumed a most formidable appearance against the native traders, dealers, and other inhabitants of the place.\n\nThe time has now arrived, and unity or combination is the cry everywhere in Bathurst among the native inhabitants to give the death struggle against the wicked contrivance of a body of men on matters respecting the re-enactment of an Ordinance that has been repealed, through your valuable assistance, by the wise and good Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Earl of Kimberley.\n\nWe have, it is true, for some time past been very careless about the internal development of our interests, and hence thrown aside things of vital importance that demand our every attention, as if we were at ease under our vines and fig-trees.\n\nHaving been aroused from our state of despondency, we have made ourselves ready for the fight, and if assistance could be afforded us through your valuable columns, we will do all that lies in our power to put an end to the monster—the slavery under which we are now groaning.

But, if the British policy there is to be such as has been shadowed forth in questions and answers in the committee-room, we are inclined to withdraw our opposition—nay more, to recommend what we most ardently opposed. The testimony to the entire discontinuance of the slave-trade, under any name or pretext, by France, has been general and convincing. On slave-trade suppression grounds there would now consequently be no loss by the substitution of French for British rule in the Gambia. If, therefore, because of economical considerations—because of the poverty of its exchequer, Great Britain declines to exercise such jurisdiction over the river and the natives along its banks, from the sea to M\'Carthy\'s Island, as will as effectually repress violence, robbery, and war, stimulate production and commerce, and aid voluntary efforts for the dissemination of Christianity, we see no justification in her retaining the Gambia, provided the French Government will consent to acquire it on reasonable terms, and under such stipulations for entire freedom of trade, and protection to Christian missions, as we feel convinced the enlightened Emperor of the French would willingly agree to. Possessing both the Senegal and the Gambia, and having already a preponderating influence in the neighbouring rivers south of the latter, and supposed to be in their upper portions in near proximity to it, as the Senegal is to the northward, the French Government, which, fortunately for African civilization, still possesses sufficient pecuniary resources to enable her to expend a few thousands a-year for bringing the over-warring natives under a peaceful restraint, as the only foundation for future enlarged production, commerce, and civilization, might, in a short time, succeed in giving a new aspect to regions whose fertility is beyond dispute, and which possess an adequate population inclined to agricultural pursuits.\n\nFor British reasons we should indeed deeply—deeply deplore such a cession of the Gambia to France. To retire from British territory in any part of the world is a serious thing; but if we are to abandon every noble, Christian, and humanitarian, as well as commercial aspiration at the dictum of a miserable economy, our country would only be dishonoured by a longer stay at the Gambia. Better leave it at once, while we have still some rags of reputation remaining from past benefits conferred.\n\n* Burton\'s ""Wanderings in West Africa.""

From the moment we heard of a new advance of the French in the rivers near Sierra Leone we felt convinced that it would do so. With the exception of the River Niger, the Gambia is the finest waterway from the Atlantic to the interior of Africa; and even were there no other considerations mixed up with the desire of possessing it, *per se*, by the French, it is well calculated to inspire such desire. But there are other considerations, and those of no mean importance. The upper waters of the River Senegal—on which river the French Government has spent very large sums of money—are not very far distant from a portion of the upper waters of the Gambia, which is a far superior river to the Senegal; and it must certainly be a matter of real importance to obtain, by means of possession of the two rivers, not only undisputed commercial and territorial possession of the rich tracts of country lying between the two streams, but a monopoly of access from the Western Ocean to the heart of West-Central Africa, with its reputed rich gold fields—with Timbuctoo, the Soudan, and the Upper Niger. Disposed as the French Government would be to spend money in the Gambia, as they have already done in the Senegal—being without rivals—being able, by possessing both streams, to bring the entire native population under a sufficient degree of subjection to force a reign of peace among them, and to insure the fullest security for traders, the River Gambia would be to the French Government and French commerce a possession of immense value. And further, when viewed in connection with the projected great railway across the Sahara, the acquisition of the River Gambia by the French Government would insure to France, within a very brief period, the absolute sovereignty over the whole of North-west and West-Central Africa. The old Roman dominion in Africa, as held after the subjection of Carthage, would be eclipsed by modern French dominion over the same and still wider regions; while the commercial spoils would be far more solidly gratifying to Paris than was the procession in chains of conquered sovereigns to the citizens of the old and renowned capital of the world. The French have, therefore, very strong and solid reasons for wishing to obtain the River Gambia, to say nothing of the *éclat* so dear to the national heart that would attend such an acquisition obtained without expenditure of either money or blood. We say without money, because for any amount they might be called upon to pay for the transfer of existing establishments they would receive their money's worth. But there are other parties interested in this matter. The people of Sierra Leone, merchants and traders, are not those to whom we would here allude. The cession of the River Gambia to France is desired by them because they want to get rid of the French from their own immediate neighbourhood. We warned them and their Government, sixteen or eighteen years ago, that the encroachments then commencing in the Mellicourie, and other neighbouring rivers, would, ere long, unless some measures were at once taken to prevent it, become a serious thorn in the side of Sierra Leone trade and commerce. The proper measures were not taken, and the result we foretold has been painfully realized. The giving up of the River Gambia to France on the sole condition of the latter withdrawing at once and for ever from what are called the Sierra Leone rivers, is, therefore, a popular idea at Freetown. It is so pleasant a thing to secure great advantages, not by any personal or local self-sacrifice, but by the sacrifice of possessions belonging to others, in which they have themselves really no interest, and on which they have not really any claim whatever. Why should the great River Gambia, an Imperial possession of magnitude and value, be given up to France, and its people be transferred beneath the rule of that Power, for the advantage of Sierra Leone? There cannot be any valid reason for such a thing. The mere withdrawal of the French from the Sierra Leone rivers in order to increase the commerce of Sierra Leone, the gains of its traders, and perhaps the public revenue, could not be any equivalent to the British Government for the cession of so important an Imperial possession as the River Gambia indisputably is; although up to the present time it has not pleased the British Government to adopt the necessary measures for utilizing it for the national benefit. Then, as we have said, there are other parties interested in this matter. We mean the more or less educated natives of Bathurst, St. Mary's, &c., and even of M'Carthy's Island, 300 miles up this noble river. On the first occasion of negotiations between the French and British Governments for the cession of the Gambia to France, the feelings and opinions of those natives against the proposed cession were very strongly expressed. They denied the right of the British Government to give them up to French dominion. Contrasting their position with that of a similar class in the Senegal, they protested against being deprived of the rights and privileges of British subjects. We espoused their cause and fought their battle. The British mercantile houses at the Gambia were also strong in their opposition; and, finally, the whole project fell to the ground. When it was again brought forward, we found that although the opinion and feelings of the people had undergone some change; though there was not the same enthusiasm in protests against the cession, there was still no desire for the withdrawal of the British Government, and the advent of that of France. During the discussions on the subject in the British Parliament, when the great advantages that would surely be obtained by the adoption by the Imperial Government of effective means for developing the acknowledged great resources of the noble river were earnestly set forth, there was something very like a pledge given by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies that some such means would be adopted. This pledge, however, has never been redeemed. No greater protection than previously has been given to trade and commerce up the river; but instead thereof, traders have been"", 'last_edit_date': '1880-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1880#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Operations in the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**69**\n\n**FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.**\n\nFor generations the existence and independence of the Kingdom of Dahomey has been a standing menace to the peace of West Africa.
