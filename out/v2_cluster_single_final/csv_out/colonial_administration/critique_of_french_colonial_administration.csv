578,"French colonial strategy in Africa involved military interventions and strategic governance to suppress local conflicts, expand influence, and maintain control over territories.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that French colonial strategy in Africa involved military interventions and strategic governance to suppress local conflicts, expand influence, and maintain control over territories. The General History of Africa highlights that from 1880 onwards, the French primarily relied on military conquest to expand their control over West Africa, particularly in regions like the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Dahomey. This often led to militant reactions from local populations, especially in more Islamized areas, with notable campaigns occurring between 1880 and 1898. The French also utilized indigenous troops for police functions during the inter-war period, indicating a strategic governance approach. The textbook notes that the French administration eroded African authority, with administrators assuming judicial roles, contrasting with the British indirect rule and suggesting a more centralized governance model. Similarly, The African Times articles describe military campaigns against figures like Mabba, Samadu, and King Behanzi, emphasizing the use of force to quell resistance and secure French interests. The articles also discuss the establishment of protectorates and treaties with local chiefs, aligning with strategic governance. French efforts to integrate territories, such as Senegal and Dahomey, into their empire illustrate their strategy of expansion and control. However, the articles also highlight the complexities faced by the French, including resistance from local leaders and the necessity of treaty negotiations, showing that military intervention was not the sole method of expansion. Together, these sources confirm the claim while revealing the multifaceted nature of French colonial strategy in Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that French colonial strategy in Africa involved military interventions and strategic governance.

The execution of this policy was entrusted to officers of the Senegalese area. As one would expect, therefore, in their occupation of West Africa, the French resorted almost exclusively to the method of military conquest rather than the conclusion of treaties of protectorate as the British did. In terms of African reactions, all the options open to them were resorted to, namely, submission, alliance and confrontation. However, as will be seen below, far more of the rulers opted for the strategy of militant confrontation than those of submission and alliance while opposition here was far more protracted than anywhere else in West Africa for two main reasons. The first, as pointed out already, was that the French used the method of military conquest almost exclusively, which consequently evoked militant reaction. The second was that the people were far more Islamized than those of the other areas of West Africa, and as Michael Crowder has pointed out, since 'for Muslim societies of West Africa the imposition of white rule meant submission to the infidel which was intolerable to any good Muslim',$^{2}$ they tended to resist the Europeans with added fervour and tenacity often lacking among nonMuslims.

This phenomenon which meant essentially the loss of African sovereignty and independence as well as land, was accomplished in two phases. The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans. It should be emphasized that these reactions were very much determined by the local African situation. Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans. This was the classical era of treaty-making in practically every nook and corner of West Africa followed in most cases by military invasions, conquests and occupation by armies of varying sizes and discipline. The period from 1880 to 1900 was the high-water mark of European conquest and occupation of West Africa. Never in the known history of the continent has so much military action been seen and so many invasions and campaigns launched against African states and communities (see Fig. 6.1). Particularly memorable were the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey (now Benin) between 1880 and 1898, and the British campaigns in Asante (in what is now Ghana), the Niger Delta region (Nigeria) and in Northern Nigeria between 1895 and 1903 (see Fig. 6.2).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': 'Whatever the variety of theories and methods of colonial domination suggested and implemented in the period between the two world wars, an emergent pattern of bureaucratic rule is evident. By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'. '$^{6}$ Indeed, as will be seen in the next volume, as a result of their repeated and often unnecessary and unjustifiable interventions in the politics of independent African states, those armies have become the heaviest of the millstones round the necks of African governments and peoples."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official. However, the most peculiar and inequitable element in the French system was the indigØnat.$^{23}$ First employed in Algeria in the 1870s, this device was imported into French West Africa in the 1880s and remained institutionally operative there as well as in Algeria until the end of the Second World War. Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.\nMore pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'.

Only in Morocco did the French seriously consider it, and there primarily because of the attention given to indigenous affairs by the ResidentGeneral, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who, in the initial years of the protec› torate, ruled with few restrictions from the metropolitan government. Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard. The French contrôleur civil was to perform in an advisory not a supervisory capacity with respect to the cadi, a Muslim official fulfilling magisterial functions in accordance with the shari'a. A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

The career of Samadu furnishes a painful illustration of the result of our policy in West Africa. A Malinke or Soninke by origin, he was born in Sonankoro, in Koniah, a province of Wassalu, near the sources of the Niger. Early in life he was taken prisoner in one of the numerous tribal wars, and became the slave of a noted Marabout, named Fodi Moussa. He soon became so powerful as to be able to enslave his own master; shortly after which he proclaimed a holy war against all infidels. Thousands of men flocked to his banner, and, before long, he became the scourge of all the States on the right bank of the Upper Niger. In 1881, the French formed an advanced post, about one hundred miles from the Niger, at Kita, in Fuludugu, and the inhabitants of the neighborhood implored their aid against Samadu. In response, Colonel Desbordes, with a force of 250 men, advanced to the relief of Keniera, which had been besieged by Samadu for some three months. The relieving column arrived too late to save Keniera, which had fallen five days before, but it attacked Samadu's army in its entrenchments, and completely dispersed it, with but small loss. Colonel Desbordes' feat had the effect of arresting Samadu's progress northwards, and secured the safety of the inhabitants of Manding and Ningshasslu. Samadu did not accept this reverse as final, and in 1883, the French having pushed their advanced posts to Bamaku, he advanced with 3,000 men to dislodge them. Colonel Desbordes sallied out to meet the enemy, and fell in with them on the banks of the Wayako, a tributary of the Niger. The action was fiercely contested. In the following month, Colonel Desbordes again sallied out; and the enemy offered a very feeble resistance, and hastily retreated fifty miles to the south, to Bankhumana. In 1884, Samadu invested a small French detachment at Nafadie. The place was relieved by a small force under Chef-de-Bataillon Combes, and the combined force cut its way through the opposing hosts and made good its retreat to Niagassola; but this attack decided the French to make a supreme effort and crush Samadu. A column of 950 men was formed under Lieut.-Colonel Frey, and arrived at Kita in January 1888, while Samadu, with 12,000 men, was encamped at Galé, thirty miles to the south. Lieut.-Colonel Frey at once marched to the attack, and, pressing on under cover of the night, reached Galé, undiscovered, at daybreak. The surprise was complete, and the enemy fled without firing a shot, abandoning their camp and some 2,000 muskets. Samadu was now convinced of his inability to cope with the French; he signified his desire for peace, and a treaty was concluded, by which he confided to them one of his sons, and engaged not to molest any of the tribes to the northward. The French having thus checked Samadu's career of conquest and slaughter in the north, that fanatic now turned his attention to the south-east, to the sphere of British influence, where there was no power to arrest his progress. Before long he overran and subjected Kouranko, Limbah, Sulimania, Kono, and Kissi. Falaba, the capital of Sulimania, and the great emporium for trade between Sierra Leone and the Niger, was captured and destroyed; and the whole of the inhabitants of that district have been exterminated or carried off. Sulimania, which was the garden of West Africa, has now become a howling wilderness.""}, {'id': 6247, 'article_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.', 'full_section_title': 'FRANCE AND DAHOMEY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1892#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_09_1892', 'content': 'The events of the French expedition against Dahomey move slowly. At the end of July, Colonel Dodds, who is in supreme command of the French force, was slowly succeeding in driving King Behanzi to terms. With the first arrival of reinforcements Colonel Dodds began to enlarge the circle of the outposts, while not neglecting the old positions. He opened two new roads, one from Porto Novo to Sakete, on the Adjara river, near the British frontier at Lagos, the other binding Porto Novo to Dangbo, a place between the Oueme and the Adjara, near the spot where Captain Oudard was killed in 1890. These operations restored peace in the Decame country. King Behanzi meanwhile continued to affirm his right to Kotonou, and persisted in the assertion of his intention to annex a portion of the province of Porto Novo, placed under the French protectorate by King Toffa. He accepted, he said, the treaty of October, 3, 1890, and he set at liberty the merchants confined at Whydah. The next movement of Colonel Dodds was in defence of certain outlying friendly villages, and he drove back by slight stages a number of Dahomey warriors.

According to a later despatch from Kotonou, the column which left that place returned on the following day after burning the villages of Kotonou, about two miles to the southwest of the French fort, and Zobo, about seven miles to the north-west. The column had a sharp encounter with the enemy, who were well-posted in ambush. The fight lasted until the evening, and the French loss was two sergeants killed and ten men slightly wounded.

Her action as regards Egypt at the end of last century is well known; and her annexation of Algeria some fifty years since has, no doubt, served by its admitted success to stimulate her still further in the same direction. But the rapidity with which she has lately been acquiring territory in the north-west portion of Central Africa is, perhaps, not generally appreciated.

Recent news from these regions is very significant. French desire for territory in this portion of Africa dates from several years ago, when M. Dupontchel, a daring engineer, proposed that a railway should be constructed across the Sahara from Algeria to Timbuctoo. The idea was magnificent, and took the fancy of the French public. An expedition was sent out to survey the route; but as it ended in the massacre of some of his party, it was understood that the time for the trans-Saharan railway had not yet come. Attention was then turned to the possibility of attaining the French ideal by way of the region of the Senegal; and Colonel Gallieni was sent thither at the head of a small expedition, charged with the task of increasing French influence and adding to French territory. One of the most formidable adversaries with whom he had to deal was the marabout Mahmadou Lamine, who for some time gave a great deal of trouble; but the latest news from the expedition is that the marabout has been killed and his men dispersed. The result of Colonel Gallieni\'s campaign—a campaign which has been conducted very quietly—is that the extent of territory under French protectorate has been doubled.

After the enlargement of the British Company in 1881 and the acknowledgment of its political aims, French enterprise was directed to the development of French influence in a similar direction. In 1882 a French company initiated the endeavour to compete with the British Company on the Lower Niger, while it also pushed overland towards the Upper Niger from the seaboard of Senegambia, and there was talk of a French Trans-Sahara railway from the Mediterranean to Lake Chad. In 1882 M. de Brazza added the territory of the French Congo to the Gaboon, and laid the foundation of the forward French movement which has since been prosecuted towards the centre of Northern Africa. In Senegambia French influence was developed with success. Military expeditions were directed against the turbulent Mohammedan tribes of the French sphere. The basin of the Lower Niger and the Binué was the only place in which French ambitions in West Africa had failed, and attempts were made to restrict within the narrowest limits the sphere claimed by the Royal Niger Company. The geographical as well as the political conditions were, however, in favour of the British Company, which had already established trading stations within 200 miles of Lake Chad. The result of five years of more or less constant struggle was that, in 1890, the Niger Company was able to show cause why the British sphere of influence should be extended to that lake. By an agreement the northern limit of the territories of the Niger Company was fixed at a line to be drawn from Barrua on the western shore of Lake Chad to Say, a town on the Upper Niger.

Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast are now completely isolated, small red spots in a great sea of French territory. It may and will be argued that the French lay claim to these enormous tracts of land in a purely nominal way, that they are not likely to interfere with our trade in these regions, and that if it pleases them to colour them French on their maps, why it is a harmless amusement, which cannot possibly affect us in any way. Unfortunately, we find upon examining the question that these arguments do not hold good. In the first place, the French, unfortunately, do not lay claim to these regions in a purely nominal way; it would seem, on the contrary, that they are secured to them by virtue of regular treaties with ourselves and with the native chiefs, if not with our approval, at least with our tacit consent. Secondly, as to their not interfering with our trade: certainly, they have not done so far to any great extent, but everything tends to show that they are beginning to do so in good earnest. The events which are taking place behind Sierra Leone are ample proof of this. French outposts are slowly advancing along our frontier line, and we are continually learning from the local papers of caravans on their way to Freetown being turned aside and obliged to take the roads leading to the French Coast Settlements. The Mohammedan chief, Samadoo, upon whose trade the colony of Sierra Leone is in a great measure dependent, and who has always been friendly towards England, is now (if we are to believe French reports) completely crushed by the two French columns sent against him in the early part of the present year.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'With the above reservation, the spread of French rule in West Africa is not a thing to be, on the whole, regretted. The method of its development is not an ideal one. It appears to resolve itself into this,—to force upon chief after chief treaties by which they acknowledge themselves to be under French protection, and then to cut off their heads and annex their territories if they carry on any little war on their own account without waiting to be protected. But this appears to be very much the practice in Africa among all the European nations which are in process of gobbling up that continent, and one carried on with especial brutality by the Germans. It must, moreover, be recollected that the greatest chiefs are themselves Mussulman conquerors from the North or from the East, whose reign is one almost invariably of terror for the aboriginal tribes,—so much so, that large territories which a century ago were filled with a busy population, are now little more than wastes. Wherever French rule extends, slave razzias cease, scattered fugitives come in from all sides to their old homes, and cultivation begins once more to spread. One of the many illustrations to Colonel Galliéni\'s volume represents the fording of the Niger by crowds of refugees from the States of the Mussulman Sovereign Samory, on its south side,—men, women, and children, to whom the boatmen on the river refused the use of their boats, for fear of Samory\'s vengeance:—\n\n""The current was very violent.

Most of this enormous extent of territory is generally considered practically worthless; the French evidently think otherwise, and time alone will show whether they are correct or not. Senegal proper extends, according to French geographers, from Cape Blanco to Cape Roxo, with the exception of that portion of it which constitutes the British colony of Gambia. The two most important towns of Senegal are St. Louis and Dakar, connected by a railway about 150 miles long. The trade of Senegal and dependencies amounted in 1890 to 1½ million sterling—that is, a quarter of a million sterling more than the average trade of Lagos, one of the most flourishing colonies on the West Coast, which is roughly estimated at one million sterling per annum. I may mention, *en passant*, that £200,000 has recently been voted by the French Chamber for renewed improvements to the port of Dakar, already one of the best on the coast. Neither must it be forgotten that a railway to the Niger is being constructed; 100 miles of this railway is already laid down and does regular service. Numerous engineers are at present employed out there, surveying the continuation of the works. The cost of completing this railway is estimated at about £1,250,000 sterling. By the completion of this railway, St. Louis would be in direct communication with the Niger, first by the Senegal River as far as Kayes (the head of the railway), and from that place, by the railway, as far as the Niger. Navigation on that river, as far as Say, the extreme limit of French influence, would therefore be assured to France. French Soudan, which is really but a continuation of Senegal, includes large tracts of country but little known, among which is Samadoo\'s empire, which extends right away to the back of Sierra Leone, leaving that colony merely 200 miles of ""Hinterland."" Rivières du Sud (northern rivers) of French Guinea, which France should never have been allowed to acquire, come third in order. It is situated between Portuguese Guinea and Sierra Leone. All the country at the back is French, so that the colony has a good ""hinterland"" to tap. Trade is as yet but small, though it seems on the increase. By a glance at any map of the district it will be seen that Sierra Leone is entirely surrounded by French territory. We now come to the fourth settlement—the Ivory Coast—all of which is now French, the territory between the Cavally and Pedro Rivers having been acquired by France by a treaty recently passed with the Republic of Liberia.

Central Africa, thus defined, is about thirty times the area of France, and fifty times that of the United Kingdom, and probably contains about one-twelfth of the population of the globe. In the second place, and for the same reason, I use the word ""England"" for ""Great Britain and Ireland,"" and ""Englishmen"" for the inhabitants of this country. ""Britain"" and ""Britons"" are, unfortunately, considered pedantic in prose.\n\nThe Anglo-German and Anglo-Portuguese agreements of 1890 have induced a colonial movement in France which, in this age of electricity, may be described as a strong secondary current. Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent. The inadequate recognition in England of this movement may perhaps be attributed to a well-founded belief on the part of ""Our own Correspondents"" that the British public has lately had a surfeit of the Dark Continent.\n\nIt may seem illogical that the demarcation by other countries of spheres of influence in East and South Africa should affect the estimates which France had previously formed of the value of the regions bordering on her possessions in the north and west of the Continent; but it is not in France alone that the fever of annexation proves contagious. To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire.

The French Government had spent large sums in the prosecution of active military proceedings, and treaties had been made with the principal native chiefs. Amongst these one of the most important was with Samory, the chieftain of the Mandingo States, which are conterminous with the north-eastern frontier of the English settlement of Sierra Leone. It was signed in 1885 in his capital of Bissandougon, and though he is now anxious to renounce his allegiance to the French Government and to place himself under English protection, he has never denied the authenticity of the document. The English commissioners had no treaties to oppose to those which were in the possession of the French. While the provisions of the treaty of 1882 with regard to the boundary of Sierra Leone were embodied in the agreement of 1889, it had become necessary in other respects to recognise existing facts. It was no longer possible to suggest that France should withdraw from her position either in the more southern portions of the coast or in the territories neighbouring upon Sierra Leone over which her protection had been accepted. The second article of the treaty fixes the northern frontier of that Colony as follows:—""The line of demarcation, after having divided the basin of the Mellacoree from that of the Great Scarcies, shall pass between Bennah and Tamhakka, leaving Talla to England and Tamisso to France, and shall approach the tenth degree of north latitude, including in the French zone the country of the Houbous, and in the English zone Soulimaniah and Fallaba. The line shall stop at the intersection of the 13th degree of longitude west of Paris (10° 40\' of Greenwich) and of the tenth degree of latitude."" Fallaba, which is situated at this point of intersection, marks, therefore, the north-eastern corner of the English territory of Sierra Leone. Beyond this no definite frontier line has been provided for, and the fear of English merchants interested in the caravan trade with the interior is that French authority will be exerted to prevent the currents of native trade which have their sources in countries subject to French influence from flowing as they now do through Fallaba to Freetown in order to turn them to the French outlet of Konakry. It appears that caravans coming from the Upper Niger to Sierra Leone have already been interfered with, and no surprise can be felt at the uneasiness with which merchants interested in the English trade must regard the prospects of the future. That France should desire to attract the trade of her hinterland to the ports of her own coast colonies is inevitable. Her intentions are shown by the instructions given to Lieut. Quiquendmon, who has lately conducted a mission through the Native States of the Upper Niger. His principal duties were to secure the markets and the commercial roads, and to prepare the way for the establishment of a French resident in one of the principal towns of the Upper Niger, whence it may be possible to extend French influence and French commerce through all the neighbouring States. These are the very States of Sigou, Sikoro, Tieba, &c., from which caravans have been in the habit of carrying native produce to Sierra Leone, and if Lieut. Quiquendmon is not deceived in the results of his activity, there is little doubt that the supremacy of France has been fully established in the regions through which he travelled. It is not in the estimate which they have formed of the position that the English Chambers of Commerce are likely to prove mistaken. French competition must be expected to grow keener with every year. It is the proposed remedy which is impossible. The kingdom of Samadoo which Lord Salisbury is petitioned to take under the protection of Great Britain falls within the acknowledged sphere of French influence and forms a part of the territories over which Colonel Archinard has lately conducted a military expedition.

Gambetta, and the operations of both were so energetically conducted that the National African Company saw itself under the necessity either of entering into a commercial war or of retiring from the position.

This fact enabled Great Britain to take a different position from what she would otherwise have occupied in regard to that part of West Africa.

Great Britain took part at the Berlin Conference in the discussion of the clause by which the navigation of the Niger was rendered free to the merchant ships of all nations, and the British representative had a determining voice in the conditions under which free navigation was accorded. It should be pointed out that the existing rights of international navigation on the Niger extend only to merchant vessels; they do not include rights of free trade with countries bordering the river, and, while Great Britain allowed freedom of navigation on the portion of the Niger falling under her protection, a clause was inserted in the General Act setting forth that nothing in these obligations should hinder Great Britain from making rules of navigation not contrary to the spirit of the engagement nor should the benefits of free navigation be enjoyed by other nations except on condition of conforming to the rules so made.\n\nGermany had in 1884 declared a Protectorate of the Cameroons.

What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The impact in the political field, then, was important though of mixed blessing.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

But, then, conditions in Europe during the same period were not so very different either. This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

Here again, conflicting answers have been given to this question. To some historians, indeed a very large number, including the Marxist and the development and anti-development theorists but for very different reasons, though colonialism was a short interlude, it nevertheless was of great significance for Africa and left an indelible impression on Africa. As R. Oliver and N. Atmore contend: 'Measured on the time-scale of history, the colonial period was but an interlude of comparatively short duration. But it was an interlude that radically changed the direction and momentum of African history.'$^{50}$ Gann and Duignan also regard the colonial era 'as most decisive for the future of Africa'.$^{51}$ The answer of the Marxists and the underdevelopment theorists is neatly summed up in the title of Rodney's book, namely, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa.

Ajayi has consistently maintained that the impact of colonialism on Africa has been exaggerated, that colonialism 'represents only an episode in a long and eventful history', and did not cause any break in continuity, that Africans retained some control over their own destinies and 'to the extent to which Africans retained initiative, the ability of Europeans to make entirely new departures in African history was limited'. Hopkins has also maintained that the 'colonial era has ceased to be regarded as the sole substance of African history and there are sound reasons for thinking that colonial rule itself had a less dramatic and a less pervasive economic impact than was once supposed'. He has insisted that colonial› ism did 'not create modernity out of backwardness by suddenly disrupting a traditional state of low-level equilibrium' and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""Finally, in the social field, the significance of colonialism here is clearly a mixed one.

Already, two new groups have been added since independence. One is the political elite made up of the leading members of the political parties that have been mushrooming in Africa and who have become the prime ministers, presidents, ministers, ambassadors, etc. The other is the military elite made up of present and ex-officers of the armed forces of each independent state. The members of these elite groups are definitely different from the people of the rural areas in terms of their dress, life style, tastes and status. Now, had these elite groups constituted a good percentage of the population of Africa, one would have accepted their formation as yet another crucial and fundamental change introduced by colonialism.

When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers.

The Prince is accompanied by his marabout, his interpreter, two of his father's Ministers, and other persons. He belongs to the tribe of Wolof Serrare, reputed to be the finest, the handsomest, and the darkest race of all Africa. They profess Mahometanism, but withal have not yet entirely renounced certain fetishist practices. The Wolofs wear short trousers and a kind of frock without sleeves, open at the sides. Their hair is plaited into several braids, and they have numberless amulets tied round their necks with leathern thongs. Prince Diowley has adopted the Arabic costume during his visit, and conceals his amulets; but he still plaits his hair according to Soudanese fashion. He occupies apartments in the Grand Hotel, which the French Government have retained for him at a cost of £20 a day. The attendants carry about them on all their excursions pewter jugs containing water for their ablutions.\n\nThe presence of this Prince in France is regarded as a favourable sign of the loyalty of those tribes of Upper Senegal which until quite recently gave the French troops so much trouble. Samory, his father, is the wealthy king of a vast Soudanese State, which he made by his prowess. He has several sons, of whom the third, Prince Diowley, is said to be his favourite, and is designated as his heir. He is 17 years of age, and is remarkably handsome and intelligent. He has learned a few words of French, and understands a good many more. He wears a caftan of green silk, embroidered with gold. He eats with relish roast meat. The mission will stay in Paris for about a fortnight, at the end of which it goes to the autumn manoeuvres. A high official of the Admiralty is to take the Prince over Paris and lionise him in the fashionable circles still in town. He and his suite will take all the theatres in turn, beginning at the Opéra. Before returning to Africa they are to be shown over the silk looms of Lyons, in order to dispel the prejudice entertained by them, in common with several tribes of the Upper Niger, that French silks are not the product of human industry, but are supplied ready to sell by the Evil Spirit.""}, {'id': 6161, 'article_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE FRENCH IN WEST AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1891#article-5', 'issue_date': '02_11_1891', 'content': 'With the above reservation, the spread of French rule in West Africa is not a thing to be, on the whole, regretted. The method of its development is not an ideal one. It appears to resolve itself into this,—to force upon chief after chief treaties by which they acknowledge themselves to be under French protection, and then to cut off their heads and annex their territories if they carry on any little war on their own account without waiting to be protected. But this appears to be very much the practice in Africa among all the European nations which are in process of gobbling up that continent, and one carried on with especial brutality by the Germans. It must, moreover, be recollected that the greatest chiefs are themselves Mussulman conquerors from the North or from the East, whose reign is one almost invariably of terror for the aboriginal tribes,—so much so, that large territories which a century ago were filled with a busy population, are now little more than wastes. Wherever French rule extends, slave razzias cease, scattered fugitives come in from all sides to their old homes, and cultivation begins once more to spread. One of the many illustrations to Colonel Galliéni\'s volume represents the fording of the Niger by crowds of refugees from the States of the Mussulman Sovereign Samory, on its south side,—men, women, and children, to whom the boatmen on the river refused the use of their boats, for fear of Samory\'s vengeance:—\n\n""The current was very violent.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

No society or individual can do it; it is folly to suppose, or act upon the supposition, that commerce, societies, or individual efforts, can be successful in rapidly reclaiming or bringing Africa from its present savage condition to a state of civilisation. Possibly private efforts might, in the lapse of many hundred years, partially effect the civilisation of this vast, rich, and unknown country. Still, if after seventy years' occupancy of Sierra Leone by Great Britain, the inhabitants do not yet know the plough, or any agricultural labour-saving implement whatever, or practise those arts known and esteemed as essential to civil life, you may form some idea of the number of years which individual effort, aided by a British Colonial Government, may require to bring Africa up to the lowest plane and meanest type of civil man.\n\nProfoundly penetrated with these views—knowing from personal and extended observation that they are founded in truth—I cannot too forcibly urge upon you and all true friends of Africa, to concentrate all of influence we may possess in obtaining united national action upon this great subject.\n\nIf it was ever the duty of civil governments to seek to redeem from savage life barbaric nations, surely it is time that England and America should combine in immediately planting in Africa such permanent institutions as will most speedily and effectually work this change. This only can be done by negotiation and the introduction of the useful arts. By establishing agricultural schools—not a chief but would warmly second their efforts—all would gladly send their children; and by the immediate introduction of labour-saving machines, to some of which you lately alluded, the wonderful productiveness of the soil and climate would largely and speedily repay any advance of capital or outlay that may be made, and peace, and law, and kindness, and plenty will effectually take the place of strife, of crime, force, hatred, and want.

The dream of the French has always been to connect Algeria with Senegal, *via* Lake Tchad, and we find they comprise the whole of the Western Sahara, situated between Senegambia proper and Algeria, in their more or less nominal ""sphere of influence."" Most of this enormous extent of territory is generally considered practically worthless; the French evidently think otherwise, and time alone will show whether they are correct or not. Senegal proper extends, according to French geographers, from Cape Blanco to Cape Roxo, with the exception of that portion of it which constitutes the British colony of Gambia. The two most important towns of Senegal are St. Louis and Dakar, connected by a railway about 150 miles long. The trade of Senegal and dependencies amounted in 1890 to 1½ million sterling—that is, a quarter of a million sterling more than the average trade of Lagos, one of the most flourishing colonies on the West Coast, which is roughly estimated at one million sterling per annum. I may mention, *en passant*, that £200,000 has recently been voted by the French Chamber for renewed improvements to the port of Dakar, already one of the best on the coast. Neither must it be forgotten that a railway to the Niger is being constructed; 100 miles of this railway is already laid down and does regular service. Numerous engineers are at present employed out there, surveying the continuation of the works. The cost of completing this railway is estimated at about £1,250,000 sterling. By the completion of this railway, St. Louis would be in direct communication with the Niger, first by the Senegal River as far as Kayes (the head of the railway), and from that place, by the railway, as far as the Niger. Navigation on that river, as far as Say, the extreme limit of French influence, would therefore be assured to France. French Soudan, which is really but a continuation of Senegal, includes large tracts of country but little known, among which is Samadoo\'s empire, which extends right away to the back of Sierra Leone, leaving that colony merely 200 miles of ""Hinterland."" Rivières du Sud (northern rivers) of French Guinea, which France should never have been allowed to acquire, come third in order. It is situated between Portuguese Guinea and Sierra Leone. All the country at the back is French, so that the colony has a good ""hinterland"" to tap. Trade is as yet but small, though it seems on the increase. By a glance at any map of the district it will be seen that Sierra Leone is entirely surrounded by French territory. We now come to the fourth settlement—the Ivory Coast—all of which is now French, the territory between the Cavally and Pedro Rivers having been acquired by France by a treaty recently passed with the Republic of Liberia. It includes the settlements of Grand Bassam, Assinee, &c. Here again we have all the ""hinterland"" under French protection, secured to that country by the explorer, Captain Binger, who, by the way, is now appointed Governor of that Colony. Trade has more than doubled in two years, and great hopes are entertained as to its future prosperity.

Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care.

A striking example is that of the Congo Free State, which, in addition to the magnificent endowment of King Leopold, is subsidised to the extent of £80,000 a year by the Belgian Government. Great Britain, on the other hand, has never contributed a shilling to aid us in our work of exploration, civilisation and extirpation of the slave trade. It would be idle to complain, even if we were disposed to do so, of being thus left entirely to our own resources, and it may be that in the long run we shall profit more from the energy evoked and the liberty fostered by independence of State subsidies and State interference. But it is an indisputable fact that commerce on the Niger has suffered heavily during the last three years from the pecuniary encouragement given to our foreign neighbours. No appreciable effect is indeed produced in respect of those articles of African produce such as gum, kernels, oil and rubber, which are not suited for land carriage over long distances; but in respect of one valuable product—viz., ivory, which is carried on the backs of slaves for immense distances at a small cost, these subsidies, which practically amount to bonuses to the local merchants, have unquestionably diverted a considerable value from the Niger markets to those of more favoured regions, and have thus diminished your annual dividends to the extent of at least 4 per cent. It is not easy to see how this result has benefited the taxpayers of the European States which pay these bonuses out of their home exchequers; but it has undoubtedly enriched the merchants of various nationalities trading in their African possessions at the expense of commerce in unsubsidised British possessions where the whole cost of administration and development has to be met by taxation on trade. Passing from these considerations of our external relations to our neighbours, I will say a few words on our own internal condition, that is on the progress of settlement within our present sphere of operations. You may perhaps remember that at our meeting two years ago I dwelt at considerable length on the great difficulties with which we have had to contend, apart from those arising from the unhealthiness of the climate and from the intermittent residence and consequent want of continuity in our staff in Africa. I pointed out that ""we have to deal with 800 tribes who have been for countless generations plunged in idle barbarism, whose sole idea of wealth has been the holding of slaves, and whose main occupation in life has been to acquire such slaves by intertribal war or kidnapping."" I am glad to be able to tell you that year by year there has been a steady growth of the whole, some influence and power of the Company—a growth necessarily slow and incomplete, but more rapid than we had ventured to anticipate. The missionaries in the Lower Niger have borne witness to the remarkable progress of peace and security under our rule. You must not understand me as saying that there is not still in those regions a vast amount of gross barbarism and uncurbed ferocity; but only that these have been mitigated and even in some places abated to a degree which more than justifies our presence there as the ruling power. Having achieved such striking success as far up the Niger as Lokoja, we have thought the time ripe for taking similar measures in the Pagan countries to the south of the Lower Benue; where, during the few years since we first established our stations, and probably for many years previously, incalculable miseries have been inflicted on the natives by slave hunters from the North and East. It is an inevitable consequence of these raids that their operations expand year by year in a wider circle, as belt after belt of country is devastated and depopulated, leaving no further prey for the slave hunters; so that tribes whom we had already commenced to train to peaceful commerce and whom we were teaching to utilise the natural resources of that fertile region, have disappeared, most of their members having been either killed or captured as slaves, while the more fortunate are hiding amongst the forests and rocks in hopes of escaping the fate of their companions. The region of which I am speaking is at present one of the principal hunting grounds for supplying the enormous and apparently insatiable demand for slaves in the Central Soudan and even as far as Morocco. You will at once understand that if we longer delayed taking the necessary remedial measures all hope of developing those fertile and once populous regions must be abandoned. We are therefore impelled by interest, as well as the ordinary feelings of humanity, to act decisively at this, the earliest practicable moment, and to afford these pagan populations— with whom we have made treaties—efficient protection to life, freedom, and property. We have, therefore, ordered the military occupation of this region, which is now being executed. This measure has demanded an increase to our small army and consequently additional expenditure, which must temporarily be met by increased taxation. I must remind you that although the establishment of peace and security will certainly bear fruit in largely increased commerce yielding a larger revenue, the immediate result will be only to preserve the trade already existing. The development which will naturally arise from a sense of security amongst the natives cannot be expected at once. You must remember that the greater portion of the taxation at present falls upon the Company, which is still by far the largest European trader in the territories, although no longer alone there, as at the time of the issue of the Charter.

From the moment we heard of a new advance of the French in the rivers near Sierra Leone we felt convinced that it would do so. With the exception of the River Niger, the Gambia is the finest waterway from the Atlantic to the interior of Africa; and even were there no other considerations mixed up with the desire of possessing it, *per se*, by the French, it is well calculated to inspire such desire. But there are other considerations, and those of no mean importance. The upper waters of the River Senegal—on which river the French Government has spent very large sums of money—are not very far distant from a portion of the upper waters of the Gambia, which is a far superior river to the Senegal; and it must certainly be a matter of real importance to obtain, by means of possession of the two rivers, not only undisputed commercial and territorial possession of the rich tracts of country lying between the two streams, but a monopoly of access from the Western Ocean to the heart of West-Central Africa, with its reputed rich gold fields—with Timbuctoo, the Soudan, and the Upper Niger. Disposed as the French Government would be to spend money in the Gambia, as they have already done in the Senegal—being without rivals—being able, by possessing both streams, to bring the entire native population under a sufficient degree of subjection to force a reign of peace among them, and to insure the fullest security for traders, the River Gambia would be to the French Government and French commerce a possession of immense value. And further, when viewed in connection with the projected great railway across the Sahara, the acquisition of the River Gambia by the French Government would insure to France, within a very brief period, the absolute sovereignty over the whole of North-west and West-Central Africa. The old Roman dominion in Africa, as held after the subjection of Carthage, would be eclipsed by modern French dominion over the same and still wider regions; while the commercial spoils would be far more solidly gratifying to Paris than was the procession in chains of conquered sovereigns to the citizens of the old and renowned capital of the world. The French have, therefore, very strong and solid reasons for wishing to obtain the River Gambia, to say nothing of the *éclat* so dear to the national heart that would attend such an acquisition obtained without expenditure of either money or blood. We say without money, because for any amount they might be called upon to pay for the transfer of existing establishments they would receive their money's worth. But there are other parties interested in this matter. The people of Sierra Leone, merchants and traders, are not those to whom we would here allude. The cession of the River Gambia to France is desired by them because they want to get rid of the French from their own immediate neighbourhood. We warned them and their Government, sixteen or eighteen years ago, that the encroachments then commencing in the Mellicourie, and other neighbouring rivers, would, ere long, unless some measures were at once taken to prevent it, become a serious thorn in the side of Sierra Leone trade and commerce. The proper measures were not taken, and the result we foretold has been painfully realized. The giving up of the River Gambia to France on the sole condition of the latter withdrawing at once and for ever from what are called the Sierra Leone rivers, is, therefore, a popular idea at Freetown. It is so pleasant a thing to secure great advantages, not by any personal or local self-sacrifice, but by the sacrifice of possessions belonging to others, in which they have themselves really no interest, and on which they have not really any claim whatever. Why should the great River Gambia, an Imperial possession of magnitude and value, be given up to France, and its people be transferred beneath the rule of that Power, for the advantage of Sierra Leone? There cannot be any valid reason for such a thing. The mere withdrawal of the French from the Sierra Leone rivers in order to increase the commerce of Sierra Leone, the gains of its traders, and perhaps the public revenue, could not be any equivalent to the British Government for the cession of so important an Imperial possession as the River Gambia indisputably is; although up to the present time it has not pleased the British Government to adopt the necessary measures for utilizing it for the national benefit. Then, as we have said, there are other parties interested in this matter. We mean the more or less educated natives of Bathurst, St. Mary's, &c., and even of M'Carthy's Island, 300 miles up this noble river. On the first occasion of negotiations between the French and British Governments for the cession of the Gambia to France, the feelings and opinions of those natives against the proposed cession were very strongly expressed. They denied the right of the British Government to give them up to French dominion. Contrasting their position with that of a similar class in the Senegal, they protested against being deprived of the rights and privileges of British subjects. We espoused their cause and fought their battle. The British mercantile houses at the Gambia were also strong in their opposition; and, finally, the whole project fell to the ground. When it was again brought forward, we found that although the opinion and feelings of the people had undergone some change; though there was not the same enthusiasm in protests against the cession, there was still no desire for the withdrawal of the British Government, and the advent of that of France. During the discussions on the subject in the British Parliament, when the great advantages that would surely be obtained by the adoption by the Imperial Government of effective means for developing the acknowledged great resources of the noble river were earnestly set forth, there was something very like a pledge given by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies that some such means would be adopted. This pledge, however, has never been redeemed. No greater protection than previously has been given to trade and commerce up the river; but instead thereof, traders have been"", 'last_edit_date': '1880-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1880#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND ENGLAND ON THE NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Those who wish to form a just idea of the economic value of Central Africa should carefully study the work just published on ""Applied Geography,"" by Mr. J.

Except that both undertakings sprang from a common spirit of commercial enterprise, the comparison is deceptive and misleading. The East India Company planted itself in countries already occupied by old civilisations, where the national intellect had been cultivated for untold ages, and commerce, with its attendant wealth, had long flourished; countries peopled by races inured to taxation, from whom large revenues could be raised without serious opposition. On the Niger there is no Pagoda-tree to be shaken with the accompanying showers of rupees. We do not, so far, raise from the natives one penny of direct revenue, the little we receive being indirectly through duties on the trade entering and leaving the country. Instead of vast populations with the inherited habit of labour, we have to deal for the most part with tribes ignorant, idle, and improvident, incapable of understanding, I need hardly say, not only the accumulation of wealth for future generations, but even the prudence of providing for their own sustenance during years of scarcity. They have not only to be taught how to work, but, what is more difficult, to be taught the habit of working.""\n\nWhile insisting on the potential wealth of Central Africa, I have dwelt on the obstacles in the way of its rapid development and on the absolute futility of an intermittent or spasmodic policy, because these points are essential to the main object of this article, which is to examine whether the existing movement in France is likely, within any period worth considering, to bring her settlements—for passing expeditions leave no results—into close contact and therefore possibly into collision with England in the Niger-Tchad basins. At the time of the conclusion of the late Anglo-French agreement, it was said that Lord Salisbury, far from having removed, *pro tanto*, the danger of conflict between the two nations, had given them a common frontier and had therefore actually created opportunities for disputes. I shall endeavour to show the fallacy of such reasoning by a short examination of the conditions which Lord Aberdare, in another speech delivered last July, summed up in the following words: ""Nature has placed between these spheres""—French and English—""formidable barriers, which could only be overcome by an initial expenditure out of all proportion to any probable returns for many years.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We now come to the last French colony on the West Coast (Gaboon, on the South-west Coast, excluded)—namely, Benin, including the coast towns of Kotonou, Porto Novo, &c., and the newly acquired Protectorate of Dahomey, bounded on the west by German Togoland, and on the east by Lagos and Voruba.

The Say-Barroua line marking the limits of French influence, according to the Anglo-French agreements, extends perpendicularly to the eastern frontier of Dahomey.\n\nSuch is the position of the French in West and Northern Central Africa, and a glance at a map of the district clearly shows that with a degree of slothfulness utterly inexplicable we have allowed France to step in behind most of our colonies and secure the rich ""Hinterlands"" in the rear. Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast are now completely isolated, small red spots in a great sea of French territory. It may and will be argued that the French lay claim to these enormous tracts of land in a purely nominal way, that they are not likely to interfere with our trade in these regions, and that if it pleases them to colour them French on their maps, why it is a harmless amusement, which cannot possibly affect us in any way. Unfortunately, we find upon examining the question that these arguments do not hold good. In the first place, the French, unfortunately, do not lay claim to these regions in a purely nominal way; it would seem, on the contrary, that they are secured to them by virtue of regular treaties with ourselves and with the native chiefs, if not with our approval, at least with our tacit consent. Secondly, as to their not interfering with our trade: certainly, they have not done so far to any great extent, but everything tends to show that they are beginning to do so in good earnest.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

As one would expect, therefore, in their occupation of West Africa, the French resorted almost exclusively to the method of military conquest rather than the conclusion of treaties of protectorate as the British did.

However, as will be seen below, far more of the rulers opted for the strategy of militant confrontation than those of submission and alliance while opposition here was far more protracted than anywhere else in West Africa for two main reasons. The first, as pointed out already, was that the French used the method of military conquest almost exclusively, which consequently evoked militant reaction. The second was that the people were far more Islamized than those of the other areas of West Africa, and as Michael Crowder has pointed out, since 'for Muslim societies of West Africa the imposition of white rule meant submission to the infidel which was intolerable to any good Muslim',$^{2}$ they tended to resist the Europeans with added fervour and tenacity often lacking among nonMuslims.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease. Indeed, for Europe, the timing of the conquest could not have been better; for Africa it could not have been worse."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': ""As noted above, the critical factor in the changing balance of power in Africa in the 1870s was not the troops, nor their training and discipline or generalship, but the quality and quantity of the guns available to the respective sides. The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': 'European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour. In the first place, thanks to the activities of European explorers and missionaries, Europeans were by 1880 far more knowledgeable about Africa and its interior - its physical appearance, terrain, economy and other resources and the strength and weakness of its states and societies - than Africans were about Europe.\nSecondly, owing to the revolutionary changes in medical technology and in particular the discovery of the prophylactic use of quinine against malaria, Europeans became far less fearful of Africa than they had been before the middle of the nineteenth century. 57 Thirdly, as a result of the uneven nature of the trade between Europe and Africa up to the 1870s, and even after, as well as the increasing pace of the industrial revolution, the material and financial resources available to Europe were overwhelming in comparison with those of Africa.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'.

Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard. The French contrôleur civil was to perform in an advisory not a supervisory capacity with respect to the cadi, a Muslim official fulfilling magisterial functions in accordance with the shari'a. A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

He is at present an officer of engineers in the service of El-Hadj-Omar, one of the most powerful sovereigns of Central Africa, and has built fortresses for that prince at Segou, Sikoro, Koundain, and Niora.

Her action as regards Egypt at the end of last century is well known; and her annexation of Algeria some fifty years since has, no doubt, served by its admitted success to stimulate her still further in the same direction. But the rapidity with which she has lately been acquiring territory in the north-west portion of Central Africa is, perhaps, not generally appreciated. It will be news to a great many people that, as the result of treaties and of recent little ""military operations,"" France is now either suzerain or ""protector"" of all the territories lying between the Senegal River, the Niger, and Sierra Leone, with the exception of the lower valleys of the Gambia and the Rio Grande, which belong to England and to Portugal respectively. Recent news from these regions is very significant. French desire for territory in this portion of Africa dates from several years ago, when M. Dupontchel, a daring engineer, proposed that a railway should be constructed across the Sahara from Algeria to Timbuctoo. The idea was magnificent, and took the fancy of the French public. An expedition was sent out to survey the route; but as it ended in the massacre of some of his party, it was understood that the time for the trans-Saharan railway had not yet come. Attention was then turned to the possibility of attaining the French ideal by way of the region of the Senegal; and Colonel Gallieni was sent thither at the head of a small expedition, charged with the task of increasing French influence and adding to French territory. One of the most formidable adversaries with whom he had to deal was the marabout Mahmadou Lamine, who for some time gave a great deal of trouble; but the latest news from the expedition is that the marabout has been killed and his men dispersed. The result of Colonel Gallieni\'s campaign—a campaign which has been conducted very quietly—is that the extent of territory under French protectorate has been doubled. It is expected that Gallic influence will shortly be greatly increased in the Fouta-Djallon, a State lying between the Gambia and the coast of Guinea, which has for some years been under the more or less nominal pro...\n\n---', 'last_edit_date': '1888-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN INTERNATIONAL RACE TO LAKE TCHAD.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We have reached the final phase of the scramble for Africa. A glance at a good map of Africa will show that there still remains one extensive and important region which has not yet been traversed by any explorer. It is the one big thing that remains to be accomplished in African exploration, and he who succeeds will well deserve the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society. The region in question extends from the Lower Congo, on the south, almost direct northwards to Lake Tchad. A large area of this region, moreover, has been left unappropriated in the various international arrangements which have been the sequel to the last six years' scramble for Africa. This region, however, is not likely to remain much longer either unexplored or unappropriated. At this moment there is an eager race between France, Germany, and England to obtain possession of an area which is undoubtedly one of the most desirable in Central Africa. By the latest Anglo-French arrangement a line from the north-west corner of Lake Tchad, drawn irregularly westwards to Say, on the Niger, was agreed upon as the southern limit of French influence. The common-sense interpretation of this arrangement, and certainly the one accepted in England, implies that France would not seek to include into any of the countries around Lake Tchad either to the east or to the south of this line. This, however, is apparently not the interpretation placed upon the arrangement in certain circles in France. The recent adventure of Lieut. Mizon on the Binué undoubtedly had in view the conclusion of treaties with the native States lying to the east of Sokoto. Fortunately, the attempt from that quarter has been frustrated. But much more ambitious schemes on the part of France are now being revealed. At present the German sphere in the Cameroons does not come east of 15 deg. E. longitude, but between this and the lower course of the Mobangi France has appropriated a great block included in her Congo territory up to the 4th parallel N., while, according to the Anglo-German Agreement, all treaties made in territories intervening between the Binué and Lake Tchad shall be notified from one Power to the other.\n\nUnder these conditions it would seem as if France had formed the ambitious project of securing an uninterrupted connexion between Algeria and the French Congo; indeed, it has been proposed to construct a railway between Algiers and Brazzaville.

In this division France is entitled to the largest share by reason of having consented to the abandonment of her rights in Eastern Africa in favour of other nations, and by reason of the efforts she has made for the development of her possessions in Algeria, Tunis, Sénégal, and the Congo district. The Anglo-French Convention has already ratified the union across the Sahara of Sénégal and Algeria. The same document accords us a footing north of Lake Tchad, which we are going to acquire from the Congo by way of Baghrimi. The extension of our influence to this latter country must be made to ratify the union across the Soudan of the French Congo and Sénégal with Algeria and Tunis. A certain number of persons, having since the end of 1889 understood the necessity for immediate action in view of the realisation of this plan, have organised at their own expense the expedition under Paul Crampel, the object of which is to explore the region between the Congo and Lake Tchad and to conclude treaties, and return if possible by the north. The same persons have favoured other expeditions. They have thus been able to serve the cause of French influence without engaging the resources or the responsibility of the State. Such initiative appears more and more necessary to-day since it has become a question of acquiring the rights of first occupants in Central Africa, and then of developing our commerce in the regions placed under French influence. It is for this reason that the subscribers to the existing African expeditions have resolved to form an association which, under the title of the Comité de l\'Afrique Française, will use all means in its power to develop the influence of France and French commerce in Western, Central, and Northern Africa. It need not be said that the association, formed in a purely patriotic spirit, and independent of all politics, is absolutely disinterested.""\n\nAn executive committee of three has been appointed to take charge of the affairs of the association.

No part of this new French colony is absolutely barren, and the richness of its vegetation and the fertility of its soil is unequalled in these equatorial regions.

The dream of the French has always been to connect Algeria with Senegal, *via* Lake Tchad, and we find they comprise the whole of the Western Sahara, situated between Senegambia proper and Algeria, in their more or less nominal ""sphere of influence."" Most of this enormous extent of territory is generally considered practically worthless; the French evidently think otherwise, and time alone will show whether they are correct or not. Senegal proper extends, according to French geographers, from Cape Blanco to Cape Roxo, with the exception of that portion of it which constitutes the British colony of Gambia. The two most important towns of Senegal are St. Louis and Dakar, connected by a railway about 150 miles long. The trade of Senegal and dependencies amounted in 1890 to 1½ million sterling—that is, a quarter of a million sterling more than the average trade of Lagos, one of the most flourishing colonies on the West Coast, which is roughly estimated at one million sterling per annum. I may mention, *en passant*, that £200,000 has recently been voted by the French Chamber for renewed improvements to the port of Dakar, already one of the best on the coast. Neither must it be forgotten that a railway to the Niger is being constructed; 100 miles of this railway is already laid down and does regular service. Numerous engineers are at present employed out there, surveying the continuation of the works. The cost of completing this railway is estimated at about £1,250,000 sterling. By the completion of this railway, St. Louis would be in direct communication with the Niger, first by the Senegal River as far as Kayes (the head of the railway), and from that place, by the railway, as far as the Niger. Navigation on that river, as far as Say, the extreme limit of French influence, would therefore be assured to France. French Soudan, which is really but a continuation of Senegal, includes large tracts of country but little known, among which is Samadoo\'s empire, which extends right away to the back of Sierra Leone, leaving that colony merely 200 miles of ""Hinterland."" Rivières du Sud (northern rivers) of French Guinea, which France should never have been allowed to acquire, come third in order. It is situated between Portuguese Guinea and Sierra Leone. All the country at the back is French, so that the colony has a good ""hinterland"" to tap. Trade is as yet but small, though it seems on the increase. By a glance at any map of the district it will be seen that Sierra Leone is entirely surrounded by French territory. We now come to the fourth settlement—the Ivory Coast—all of which is now French, the territory between the Cavally and Pedro Rivers having been acquired by France by a treaty recently passed with the Republic of Liberia. It includes the settlements of Grand Bassam, Assinee, &c.

In 1882 a French company initiated the endeavour to compete with the British Company on the Lower Niger, while it also pushed overland towards the Upper Niger from the seaboard of Senegambia, and there was talk of a French Trans-Sahara railway from the Mediterranean to Lake Chad. In 1882 M. de Brazza added the territory of the French Congo to the Gaboon, and laid the foundation of the forward French movement which has since been prosecuted towards the centre of Northern Africa. In Senegambia French influence was developed with success. Military expeditions were directed against the turbulent Mohammedan tribes of the French sphere. The basin of the Lower Niger and the Binué was the only place in which French ambitions in West Africa had failed, and attempts were made to restrict within the narrowest limits the sphere claimed by the Royal Niger Company. The geographical as well as the political conditions were, however, in favour of the British Company, which had already established trading stations within 200 miles of Lake Chad. The result of five years of more or less constant struggle was that, in 1890, the Niger Company was able to show cause why the British sphere of influence should be extended to that lake. By an agreement the northern limit of the territories of the Niger Company was fixed at a line to be drawn from Barrua on the western shore of Lake Chad to Say, a town on the Upper Niger.

Elsewhere, but as part of the same policy—a policy of making the whole of the Western Soudan a great dependency of France—equal energy was displayed. If the reader will refer to any map of Africa of fair scale he will find a place marked Assinee on the coast, not very far removed from Cape Coast Castle. Assinee was formerly an old French dependency, and this dependency, in pursuance of the same policy, was revived, and its boundary extended until the whole shore line between the British Gold Coast Colony on the east and the Republic of Liberia on the west has now been secured by France. Further to the east again, Porto Novo and other stations, on what was once the Slave Coast, are in the occupation of the French, and from them they have carried their arms into the Kingdom of Dahomey. Even on the Lower Niger the French established themselves, and only the conjunction of forces represented by the National African Company led to their traders withdrawing, and to the relinquishing of territorial claims in that neighbourhood.\n\nIt was not till 1884 that the career of Germany in Africa began.

Since 1874 the British Government has been continuously occupied with boundary questions; but the Conference held at Berlin in 1885, and the famous Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 relating to Africa and Heligoland (which re-stated and revised the boundary between the two Powers in the Niger regions, and also marked a line between the German Protectorate of Togo, and the British Gold Coast colony), have helped materially in the simplification of those knotty points which have inevitably arisen from time to time.

But this appears to be very much the practice in Africa among all the European nations which are in process of gobbling up that continent, and one carried on with especial brutality by the Germans.

""Britain"" and ""Britons"" are, unfortunately, considered pedantic in prose.\n\nThe Anglo-German and Anglo-Portuguese agreements of 1890 have induced a colonial movement in France which, in this age of electricity, may be described as a strong secondary current. Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent. The inadequate recognition in England of this movement may perhaps be attributed to a well-founded belief on the part of ""Our own Correspondents"" that the British public has lately had a surfeit of the Dark Continent.\n\nIt may seem illogical that the demarcation by other countries of spheres of influence in East and South Africa should affect the estimates which France had previously formed of the value of the regions bordering on her possessions in the north and west of the Continent; but it is not in France alone that the fever of annexation proves contagious. To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire.

The larger of the two French companies was formed under the auspices of M. Gambetta, and the operations of both were so energetically conducted that the National African Company saw itself under the necessity either of entering into a commercial war or of retiring from the position. It determined upon adopting the former course, and was so far successful that at the Berlin Conference in 1884 to consider the whole West African position, the British representative was enabled to state that ""the whole trade of the Niger Basin is at the present moment exclusively in British hands."" This fact enabled Great Britain to take a different position from what she would otherwise have occupied in regard to that part of West Africa. A British Protectorate had been declared in July 1884, over the portion of the coast stretching from Lagos to the Rio del Rey and inland to the confluence of the Niger and the Binué. Great Britain took part at the Berlin Conference in the discussion of the clause by which the navigation of the Niger was rendered free to the merchant ships of all nations, and the British representative had a determining voice in the conditions under which free navigation was accorded. It should be pointed out that the existing rights of international navigation on the Niger extend only to merchant vessels; they do not include rights of free trade with countries bordering the river, and, while Great Britain allowed freedom of navigation on the portion of the Niger falling under her protection, a clause was inserted in the General Act setting forth that nothing in these obligations should hinder Great Britain from making rules of navigation not contrary to the spirit of the engagement nor should the benefits of free navigation be enjoyed by other nations except on condition of conforming to the rules so made.\n\nGermany had in 1884 declared a Protectorate of the Cameroons.

The English commissioners had no treaties to oppose to those which were in the possession of the French. While the provisions of the treaty of 1882 with regard to the boundary of Sierra Leone were embodied in the agreement of 1889, it had become necessary in other respects to recognise existing facts. It was no longer possible to suggest that France should withdraw from her position either in the more southern portions of the coast or in the territories neighbouring upon Sierra Leone over which her protection had been accepted. The second article of the treaty fixes the northern frontier of that Colony as follows:—""The line of demarcation, after having divided the basin of the Mellacoree from that of the Great Scarcies, shall pass between Bennah and Tamhakka, leaving Talla to England and Tamisso to France, and shall approach the tenth degree of north latitude, including in the French zone the country of the Houbous, and in the English zone Soulimaniah and Fallaba. The line shall stop at the intersection of the 13th degree of longitude west of Paris (10° 40\' of Greenwich) and of the tenth degree of latitude."" Fallaba, which is situated at this point of intersection, marks, therefore, the north-eastern corner of the English territory of Sierra Leone. Beyond this no definite frontier line has been provided for, and the fear of English merchants interested in the caravan trade with the interior is that French authority will be exerted to prevent the currents of native trade which have their sources in countries subject to French influence from flowing as they now do through Fallaba to Freetown in order to turn them to the French outlet of Konakry. It appears that caravans coming from the Upper Niger to Sierra Leone have already been interfered with, and no surprise can be felt at the uneasiness with which merchants interested in the English trade must regard the prospects of the future. That France should desire to attract the trade of her hinterland to the ports of her own coast colonies is inevitable. Her intentions are shown by the instructions given to Lieut. Quiquendmon, who has lately conducted a mission through the Native States of the Upper Niger. His principal duties were to secure the markets and the commercial roads, and to prepare the way for the establishment of a French resident in one of the principal towns of the Upper Niger, whence it may be possible to extend French influence and French commerce through all the neighbouring States. These are the very States of Sigou, Sikoro, Tieba, &c., from which caravans have been in the habit of carrying native produce to Sierra Leone, and if Lieut. Quiquendmon is not deceived in the results of his activity, there is little doubt that the supremacy of France has been fully established in the regions through which he travelled. It is not in the estimate which they have formed of the position that the English Chambers of Commerce are likely to prove mistaken. French competition must be expected to grow keener with every year. It is the proposed remedy which is impossible. The kingdom of Samadoo which Lord Salisbury is petitioned to take under the protection of Great Britain falls within the acknowledged sphere of French influence and forms a part of the territories over which Colonel Archinard has lately conducted a military expedition. To accept offers of submission from its chief and to establish the political rights within his frontiers which the merchants of Liverpool desire would be a direct contravention of the spirit of all the African treaties of last year.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Royal Niger Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Amongst the questions which the French and British position in West Africa has brought forward for more or less immediate decision is that of the future of the Royal Niger Company.\n\nThe very great services rendered by this Company to the Empire hardly need, in the light which has been thrown upon them by late events, to be recapitulated. Organised originally under another name for the purpose of amalgamating British interests upon the Lower Niger, the first years of its corporate existence were devoted to the object of outstripping all foreign competitors for local influence, and especially to fighting with its own weapons an important French commercial enterprise organised under the auspices of M. Gambetta for the political purpose of establishing French rights in a region known to be one of the most valuable in Africa. Between the years 1881 and 1885 the Company almost ruined itself in defeating the efforts of France to gain possession of the basin of the Lower Niger. But although the struggle ran at moments so close, the result was entirely successful for British interests. The French houses withdrew from that portion of the river, and in consequence of what had been done Great Britain was enabled, at the Conference at Berlin in 1884, to take the position of the only Power having influence on the Lower Niger. The services of the Company were cordially recognised by the British Government of the day, and its position as a political instrument was greatly strengthened by the grant of a charter in 1886.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies. It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain. The protectorate, announced at Bonny, in December last, by Admiral Sir Walter Hunt Grubb, extends from the right bank of Benin river to the Rio del Rey, thus including Brass, New and Old Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and other important trading stations.\n\nTwo series of considerations, the internal and external, have combined to render action imperative, and a retrospective view may not be uninstructive. Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river. There Ja Ja found a place for his town, and established himself as King of Opobo.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1888#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
