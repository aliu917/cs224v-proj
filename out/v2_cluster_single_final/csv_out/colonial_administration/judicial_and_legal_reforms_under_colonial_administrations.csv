226,"The colonial legal system in Africa was fundamentally flawed, allowing Europeans and influential local figures to evade justice for crimes against Africans due to systemic inefficiencies, racial biases, and a lack of accountability and evidence.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the claim that the colonial legal system in Africa was fundamentally flawed. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the imposition of European judicial institutions that often disregarded African customary law, focusing on punishment rather than redress, which exemplifies systemic inefficiencies. It also points to the paternalistic nature and racial biases inherent in the legal structures, such as the French indigénat system, which allowed arbitrary punishment by French administrators. The text describes how colonial officials often acted as dictators rather than advisors to traditional rulers, enforcing unpopular measures and indicating a lack of accountability. Although the textbook does not explicitly mention Europeans or influential local figures evading justice, it supports the notion of a biased and flawed legal framework. In contrast, The African Times articles provide explicit examples of Europeans and influential local figures evading justice, highlighting systemic inefficiencies like inadequate police and judicial systems. The articles detail racial biases, with Europeans receiving lenient sentences or acquittals despite clear evidence of their crimes, such as in the case of Thomas Lubley. They also illustrate a lack of accountability, with officials escaping punishment, as seen in the case of a government official fined a mere £5 for an assault resulting in the death of four natives. Furthermore, the manipulation of legal processes and racial prejudice in jury decisions are evident, reinforcing the claim of a biased and ineffective legal system in delivering justice for Africans. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of a colonial legal system fraught with inefficiencies, racial biases, and a lack of accountability, allowing for the evasion of justice by Europeans and influential local figures.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that the colonial legal system in Africa was fundamentally flawed. The text highlights the imposition of European judicial institutions that often disregarded African customary law, with a focus on punishment rather than redress, which could be seen as a systemic inefficiency. The colonial system's paternalistic nature and the racial biases inherent in the legal structures are evident, as seen in the French indigénat system, which allowed arbitrary punishment by French administrators. Furthermore, the text describes how colonial officials often became dictators rather than advisors to traditional rulers, using them to enforce unpopular measures, which suggests a lack of accountability. The racial discrimination and the imposition of European norms over African systems further indicate a biased legal framework. However, the text does not explicitly mention Europeans or influential local figures evading justice for crimes against Africans, which is a notable difference from the claim.

Racial biases are evident in cases where Europeans received lenient sentences or were acquitted despite clear evidence of their crimes, such as the case of Thomas Lubley, who was given a light sentence for a heinous crime against a young African girl.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Beyond the official rhetoric, the mundane purposes of colonization turned out to be quite limited. In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'However, we find that even in the Muslim emirates of Northern Nigeria where it would appear there was a harmony of interests between the colonial power and the emirs, the union between the European and indigenous administrative systems was never organic. The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism. For the Negroes in particular the theory postulated a degree of cultural barrenness which made it necessary and possible to explain their history and social evolution in terms of the Hamitic impact.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola', 'content': ""Regarded as nonentities by the Europeans, subject to corporal punishment, and sometimes to arbitrary and venal treatment at the hands of the colonial authorities, to the demands of labour-recruiters and the collusion between government officials and resident Portuguese, Africans became outcasts in their own countries. They did, however, have several means of escaping the pressures that were brought to bear on them.\nThe first form of resistance consisted of taking up arms, but this was steadily abandoned from the end of the First World War since it was ultimately and hopelessly doomed to failure. There were fewer and fewer leaders, most weapons had been confiscated and gunpowder was, with a few exceptions, no longer available on the open market. The second alternative was to go into hiding. When the situation became intolerable, entire villages abandoned their fields and moved to areas furthest from the reach of the colonial authorities. Peasant flight was particularly common in the northern and eastern regions which remained effectively outside Lisbon's control. Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final. There is widespread evidence of massive clandestine emigration into the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia and even South West Africa. Often members of the rural population travelled great distances through harsh terrain with young children on their backs to free themselves from the tyranny of Portuguese colonial rule. If they were caught by the colonial authorities or the local African police, the men were beaten and imprisoned and the women sexually abused.\nThe fourth type of resistance to colonial rule were the religious or messianic cults founded by Africans in reaction to the colonial religion. There appears to have been little local initiative behind this metaphysical revolt of the Angolans since most of the independent churches came primarily from the Belgian Congo, spilling over into the Bakongo region of northern Angola."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.\nMore pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Because both groups lacked any significant power, direct confrontation was often not a viable strategy.

The dominant European popula› tion, as in the United States, perceived these forms of 'day-to-day resistance' as prima facie evidence of the docility and ignorance of their subordinates rather than as expressions of discontent. 34 Tax evasion occurred with great frequency throughout all of Central Africa. Just before the arrival of the tax collector, all or part of a village would flee into an inaccessible region until the state official departed. In Northern Rhodesia, the Gwemba Tonga were notoriously successful evaders, as were their Bisa and Unga neighbours who fled into the Bagwelu swamps.$^{35}$ This practice was so common in Mozambique that one official noted in disgust, 'It remains unknown how many times six or more adults will flee from their kraal leaving only a blind, ill or elderly individual who is exempt from taxes'.$^{36}$ Those Africans fortunate enough to live along international borders could slide back and forth across the frontier avoiding the tax collectors of both colonies.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims. As a result, closely related and sometimes previously politically united peoples at times found themselves on opposite sides of the agreed boundary lines.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves. In a milieu of cultural symbiosis, Africans contributed almost as much to the rest of the society as they accepted from it. Of course, the more they needed and the less they found, the more they became creative as the patois speech pattern of the previously French eastern Caribbean islands and the papiamento of the previously Dutch Antilles reveal. Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'When the American slave systems disintegrated during the nineteenth century, the basic institutional forms and social attitudes of the societies had already been established.

In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour. In the coffee, cattle and fishing areas of south-eastern Brazil, Puerto Rico, eastern Cuba, and the interior provinces of Venezuela and Argentina, social mobility tended to be greater, social distances shorter, and internal class and caste distinctions more relaxed and less formal than in the plantation zones.

J., a Liboo trader for a French house, some months ago, left here to return to his home at Dakhar, in Senegal. He was heavily deficient in his accounts. His employers learned after he left here that he had sent several slaves he had purchased with their goods in this river by land to Dakhar. They sent to the French authorities there; the man and his slave, were brought before the Commandant. The man denied he had bought the slaves; he said that he did a large trade with Tody Cubba, a robber chief in the Jolah country, and that Tody Cubba had given them, a present, to him. The Commandant told the slaves they were free to go where they liked; they were free; asked them, did they want to leave the trader or stay with him? They replied, they wished to stay with him, as they knew him better than any one else. The trader therefore, kept the slaves. The truth is, these people were bought by the trader from Tody Cubba at prices varying from 12l. to 20l.; and being Jolahs, they could not return to their country, as, once a Jolah is sold out of the country, he or she cannot return again; it is against law and custom. Of course, nothing can be done to the trader, as sufficient legal evidence cannot be obtained to prove slave-dealing. Anyhow, not being a British subject, he is not amenable to the slave-trade law.

The robbery by traders in the river this year is past all previous experience; it is now wholesale. Formerly they used to ""invest"" in slaves, cattle, country cloths, and some goods; this year they have done all the above. One man I know bought two new slave wives, besides other slaves. But, in addition, they have shipped down to Bathurst, by native-owned vessels, quantities of ground nuts, there to be sold by friends of theirs for cash. And this sort of business has culminated in one case where the man in charge sent vessel after vessel to Bathurst, to a confederate there, loaded with his employer\'s ground nuts, and had them sold there; at last he was detected and dismissed.\n\nIn many parts women go with salt to buy corn. A trader transfers (?) to one of these women a quantity of ground nuts, say 50 to 200 or more bushels at a time; she ships these in her name to Bathurst, and pays him the proceeds, less commission. If an employer or his clerk goes to such a port and asks the trader, ""Whose nuts are these?"" he answers, ""My wife\'s,"" i.e. mistress. Such produce cannot be touched under English law. As the woman is not married in a church in Bathurst, she is not a legal wife.\n\nI have seen vessels loading such stolen nuts, and have seen nuts sent by canoe to a vessel at another port, to ship to Bathurst for sale there; but I could not legally prove this to the satisfaction of a jury, as my informants dare not give evidence. The crop this year has been very large and heavy. The prices traders get for goods are high; in some class of goods they have got as much as 25 to 100 per cent. from the natives over and above the price such goods were invoiced to them by their employers, who pay all their expenses as well as wages and food; yet the employers will not get a penny of such profit, and many traders\' accounts will show a loss. They say plainly that, no matter what loss they make, English law cannot touch them; they are free of arrest for debt, and if tried criminally, the jury will not convict.\n\nThe case of Regina v. Thomas, at the late Sessions in Bathurst, bears out this assertion. Thomas was tried for stealing ten turkey eggs; he denied stealing ten eggs, and said it was ""only four eggs he had taken."" The case was clearly proven by witnesses, besides his own admission, yet the jury refused to convict, said they had ""a doubt on their minds,"" and gave him the benefit of it; so the prisoner was discharged. Trial by jury is as big a farce in cases of theft or embezzlement, before the Courts in Bathurst, as trial for agrarian crime is in Ireland.—Your obedient servant,'}, {'id': 6014, 'article_title': 'SLAVERY IN A BRITISH COLONY.', 'full_section_title': 'SLAVERY IN A BRITISH COLONY.', 'last_edit_date': '08-29-1890', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1890#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_10_1890', 'content': '""On March 26, 1890, a woman named Fanny Hogan was prosecuted before District Commissioner Edward M\'Munn, at Accra, on a charge of slave dealing, and it was proved that she had bought for £3 a child named Nyamie Domah.

Almost immediately afterwards, however, the district commissioner was peremptorily ordered by Sir W.

Subsequently, on June 20, Mr. Perregrine, after refusing to transfer a slave boy, in the possession of Ellen Quartey, the concubine of a white resident, to his own mother, was only constrained to do so by Mr. Joseph Cornelius instituting criminal proceedings in the Queen\'s name against Ellen Quartey; and when that was done, and the slave owning was proved, no penalty whatever was imposed on the woman.\n\n""It is notorious that at no time, or only on very rare occasions, has the Ordnance No. 1 of 1874 been adequately enforced as regards either the liberation and careful apprenticeship of children imported into the colony and there sold as slaves, or the punishment of slave-dealers and slave-owners.

Kidd and M'Coskry, of Liverpool. His victim was a little girl eight years of age. We cannot enter into the filthy details, though all the evidence is before us. He was tried on the 6th of the present month. The result is, in our opinion, disgraceful to the jury, and not so creditable as we could wish to the judge. How any jury could, upon the evidence, have acquitted Lubley of the *rape*, when among other conclusive evidence it was proved that the poor child was bleeding during four days, we cannot possibly conceive. But we hope to get some explanation of this. Having, however, thus escaped upon the capital charge, he pleaded *Guilty* to that of criminal assault with attempt, &c.; and here, again, his good fortune did not desert him. The judge sentenced him to *four months' imprisonment*, with hard labour. This last part, of course, for a *European* at Lagos is a farce; and so four months' imprisonment is considered adequate punishment for that act of beastly atrocity. One of our duties is to demand equal justice for the coloured and white subjects of Her Majesty in Lagos and elsewhere on the West Coast; and we ask, would the trial have had such results if the child had been white, the daughter of a European resident at Lagos, and the criminal one of the educated Africans there? We do not hesitate to say that the accused would have been found guilty of the capital offence, and been hung or sentenced to imprisonment for a long term of years; or, even supposing the impossibility that he could have had the good fortune of Lubley and been acquitted of the capital offence, we are quite sure that for the criminal assault he would, and most deservedly, have been sentenced, even by that same judge, to four years, instead of four months' imprisonment.

The defendants were indicted for culpable homicide in the one case, and assault in respect of the others; and the Solicitor-General, who prosecuted for the Crown, described the narrative as exhibiting ""a monotony of brutality.""\n\nFor the defence it was alleged that nothing more than a ""common assault"" had been committed, and only by one of the farmers, Mr. J. P. T. Hart. Mr. Hart himself gave evidence, in which he said that he had only used a ""reim,"" not a ""sjambok,"" in flogging the natives, who had been killing valuable sheep belonging to him. His anger at his losses had something to do with the severity of the punishment. The jury found the defendants guilty of ""common assault under great provocation,"" but acquitted them altogether on the other indictment.\n\nMr. Justice Jones, while admitting that there was some reason for the merciful view taken by the jury regarding the former charge, characterised the verdict of acquittal on the charge of homicide as ""a disgrace to the community.""

Our readers will not have overlooked the correspondence and copies of memorials in the African Times, during past months, on the important subject of ""Trial by Jury"" at the Gambia, in both criminal and civil cases. The battle, if we may so term it, between officialism, which espoused the cause of some half a dozen European mercantile agents and traders on the one hand, and the native population on the other, commenced with the failure to obtain conviction on two charges of wrongfully disposing of property by native traders up the River who had been entrusted with goods for sale by an importer at Bathurst. The jury would not convict; they could not agree, there being a minority for acquittal. The cases were fully stated in our columns, by the prosecutor on the one hand, and Mr. Thomas Quin, foreman of the jury, and one of the dissenting minority, on the other. The latter expressed his firm conviction of the innocence of the accused, exposed certain errors on the part of the Chief Magistrate, and stated his belief that when the trials were resumed, as they were to be, before the Chief Justice from Sierra Leone, the ruling of the Judge would be in favour of the prisoners, and they would be again acquitted. And this proved to be correct. Meanwhile, however, the official and European elements had lost no time in dealing with the matter. An Ordinance was framed and sent home for approval, abolishing trial by jury in criminal cases of that description, and substituting therefor trial by the Chief Magistrate and two Commissioners or two Justices of the Peace. The native traders, in a body, memorialized the Secretary of State against such a change in the law, praying him to disapprove of the same. If the following, which came by the last mail, be correct, and we see no reason for disbelieving it, the decision has gone against them.

The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink.""

Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""soon brought to see ourselves as other see us—as brutal heathens, real pucca heathens, with the exception that we have not here such virtue as the heathen possesses until he is contaminated by us.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914', 'content': ""and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult. Only in places like Old Calabar, where the slaves were permanently alienated, with little inclination to integrate them culturally, and with a tradition of competition among the ruling elite to show off wealth by the number of slaves killed in funeral ceremonies,$^{21}$ did the slaves in the agricultural villages combine in a secret cult to demand improved conditions. Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

Two Kafirs were condemned to death at the last circuit—the one for an atrocious criminal assault on a female, the other for murder. In both cases the circumstances were of the blackest hue, and no effort was made to interfere with the course of justice. The usual preparations were made, and every expedient precaution seems to have been adopted to ensure the satisfactory execution of the dreadful sentence, but Natal is yet deficient in the proper appliances and the professional skill pertaining to the hangman\'s office. Early on the morning appointed a large crowd of white and black spectators had gathered round the gallows—protected, as it was, by a military guard. The unhappy couple arrived perfectly indifferent to their fate, exhibiting the utmost insouciance and jocularity. On reaching the scaffold, the younger one—convicted of the criminal assault—began in a vivacious manner to evade, so far as he could, the designs of the executioner. The drop fell, when, to the horror of all around, the halter of the murderer snapped, and he fell heavily. The younger prisoner had managed to stride across the trap, and thus to avoid his doom. We shall not describe the efforts which were now made by the hangman and an assistant to force the prisoner down the trap, nor the struggles which the latter made in order to escape his fate. Suffice it that after several minutes had elapsed the work of strangulation was being accomplished. Nor shall we enter into the horrid details of the other\'s fate. Enough to say that again the rope broke, and again the unfortunate creature, amidst the groans of the crowd, underwent the fearful process, and on the third occasion the attempt proved successful. It is a curious incident that the impression left on the minds of the onlooking natives, and of the prisoner himself, was, that having committed three murders, he was to be hanged three times. So strong a sensation has this occurrence excited, that we hope there is little likelihood that such a tragedy will be enacted for the third time, and that in future the proper appliances will be provided. This is the proper place to state that criminal assaults upon European females have been frequently attempted of late by Kafirs, and the extreme punishment of the prisoner already mentioned was an example sternly demanded by law and by society.""\n\nThe following are our prices current: Butter, 1s. 3d. per lb.; bacon, 6d. to 10d. per lb.; hams, 1s. per lb.; cheese, 1s. per lb.'}, {'id': 308, 'article_title': 'AFRICAN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.

Moreover, many intermarriages took place, and this confusion became intensified. The location of the various tribes on modern maps was not to be relied upon, as the natives themselves were not able to define their localities. The descendants of the Arabs were nomadic, and wandered from place to place with their flocks. These might be called the first class, and were, as a rule, the masters of the country. The second class were the descendants of the Berbers, the ancient possessors of the country; who were now subject to their Arab conquerors, to whom they paid tribute for protection. The Berbers lived in towns and villages, and were devoted to trade. The manners and customs of the Arab and Berber tribes were very similar. In physique the men were tall, well proportioned, and vigorous, graceful in their movements, and capable of enduring great hardships and fatigue. As a rule, they were good-looking, with fine eyes and teeth, and well-shaped noses and mouths. Of late there had been an admixture of negro blood, and it appeared to be on the increase. The women were by no means beautiful. Their features were coarse; they had broad noses, large mouths, prominent teeth, and many of them had a forbidding look, which was caused by lowering the eyebrows. Morality was at a very low ebb. Their religious laws allowed them great freedom. They were apparently very devout, joining in prayer five times a day. The more of the Koran they knew the more devout they were considered; goodness did not necessarily come from the heart, but was the expression of the lips. They were the dupes of the ""holy man,"" who plundered them and presumed on their ignorance and fanaticism. The Koran and a book called ""Daleel el chariat"" (""Guide to Goodness"") were the only books they had. He had a copy of the latter sent him, and its beautiful writing and illuminations showed that the priests were well taught. Usually in case of crime an assembly of the head men of the tribe was called together and was presided over by a holy man. Murder was sometimes punished by death, but it was very rare.

In this instance it was only a poor, helpless, ignorant, alien native African, who knew nothing of the English language or laws, who, if he did even with his own hand commit the murder imputed to him, believed when he so committed it that according to native custom it was in the full exercise of his right as one of a hostile expedition in an enemy's town to commit it. But it might not always be a poor alien native that the Executive would desire to have convicted. If once such a system be allowed to pass unchallenged, it is impossible to assign any limits to the horrors that might be committed under the cloak of justice by such a governor and such a judge as we have above supposed might at some future time exercise concurrent jurisdiction in Sierra Leone. Any defender of public rights against the views of the Executive, any one who from whatever cause became obnoxious to the Executive, might become a helpless victim. This must not be. The public safety demands that it shall be made impossible. The power to execute a sentence of death without previous confirmation in England by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies must be taken away. We can imagine no circumstances, except where a colony is in a state of open rebellion, in which any evil can arise from such delay in executing a man who has been sentenced to death, while the enormous evil that may arise by leaving such powers of execution without previous reference to England, in the hands of any governor of such Crown colonies as those on the West Coast of Africa, must be evident to every one. A people jealous of its rights and liberties, and watchful over the priceless boon of individual and public security, will never fail to protest and appeal against any defect in the laws and regulations by which it is governed. There is a manifest danger lurking near every man in the Sierra Leone community. Will not that community, as one man, protest against its continuance? Will they not petition without loss of time for the removal of this threatening danger? We cannot think otherwise. And while we would have them petition the Colonial-office that the power to inflict the penalty of death under sentence of a local criminal court be no longer left in the hands of any local executive authority, but that in all such cases there should be a reference to England, and no execution of the sentence without express order from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, we would not have them content with this petition only.

Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders.

It would take a lengthened space were I to relate all the circumstances which resulted in the most brutal murder of this poor man. I shall only confine myself to what I myself saw. He was paraded round about the town, and then taken to the place of his execution, where he was placed in the middle of a large concourse of spectators, all, except the women, armed almost to the teeth, and then literally butchered.\n\nNot quite a week after this, an English vessel called the ""John Bardon,"" which was lying off here trading, was driven on shore by a violent hurricane; all efforts were made by her crew to save her, and she might have certainly been saved if assistance had been rendered to her. She made signal for a boat to come alongside to give help, but none of the savages, who were then about 300 on the beach, could be prevailed upon to do so; although many of them were good boatmen, and although large rewards were offered if they would do so. The whole crowd of the natives present, anticipating the plunder which the wreck would afford, appeared exceedingly anxious that the vessel might run ashore. They jumped for joy, invoking their Fetish to cause the vessel to wreck. After an unsuccessful effort, the crew abandoned the vessel, and came on shore in a small boat with a few bags and boxes containing their clothes; but no sooner did they land on the beach, than a great crowd of natives rushed to the boat and carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. The owner, John Wood, was himself among the number of his crew, and I understand that his box, containing a large amount of money and other valuables, was carried away by those ruthless people. I saw him sitting on the beach in a senseless state, bleeding profusely from his leg, and surrounded by a host of savages, who, had it not been for the presence of a few civilized gentlemen on the spot, and also Chief Amagarsbi, would have stripped them quite naked.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1872#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RECENT REVOLT IN THE CAMEROONS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In connexion with the recent meeting of the Native police against the German authority in the Cameroons, very serious charges have been made against some of the highest officials in the Colony. They are accused of the most revolting cruelty towards the Natives; and the particulars agree with the facts revealed by the insurrection, especially in regard to the floggings and other barbarities of a disciplinary nature. There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental. A brutal Colonial Governor among savages is the worst possible enemy of the State he represents, and he does more to sap its authority than all the witch doctors put together. The sense of natural justice is perhaps strongest in those races that know very little of the other variety.\n\nThe *Neue Deutsche Rundschau* for April contains an article entitled ""Pages from the Diary of a German in the Cameroons,"" which throws a lurid light on the proceedings that led up to the recent outbreak of the Native police force. The writer is anonymous, but appears to be an official of some kind, sent out at a later period than the men whom he puts in his terrible pillory. No one can read the diary without feeling convinced of its good faith, and its publication has made an immense stir in Germany. Englishmen have their own crimes against Natives to answer for, and no white race that has had to live with black races is blameless. The courage implied in the publication of such a document shows that German opinion is sound at heart, and all white peoples may learn how terrible are the dangers to which despotic rule over ""inferior"" races exposes the white man, and how essential it is never to relax the precautions against his demoralisation which experience has proved to be required:—\n\nMarch 13, 1893.—I hear some interesting particulars about the Bakoko rising. There are numerous inaccuracies in the official reports. Assessor Wehlau, the leader of the expedition, while the villages were burning, gave orders that some old women should have their throats cut; as for men, he could not take prisoners. Instead of the 150 prisoners of the official report, there were, according to my informant, only twelve or fifteen. Weary, wounded, half-starving, covered with bruises and sores, these few—mostly old women, greybeards, and children—were landed from the ship and beaten and shoved in fetters to the prison.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land. Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'African traditional religion and colonial rule', 'content': 'Africans used their religion as a weapon to resist colonial rule and its threat to their values, and often relied on magic and the intervention of their ancestors and gods in their fight against colonial oppression.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule.

Two Kafirs were condemned to death at the last circuit—the one for an atrocious criminal assault on a female, the other for murder. In both cases the circumstances were of the blackest hue, and no effort was made to interfere with the course of justice. The usual preparations were made, and every expedient precaution seems to have been adopted to ensure the satisfactory execution of the dreadful sentence, but Natal is yet deficient in the proper appliances and the professional skill pertaining to the hangman\'s office. Early on the morning appointed a large crowd of white and black spectators had gathered round the gallows—protected, as it was, by a military guard. The unhappy couple arrived perfectly indifferent to their fate, exhibiting the utmost insouciance and jocularity. On reaching the scaffold, the younger one—convicted of the criminal assault—began in a vivacious manner to evade, so far as he could, the designs of the executioner. The drop fell, when, to the horror of all around, the halter of the murderer snapped, and he fell heavily. The younger prisoner had managed to stride across the trap, and thus to avoid his doom. We shall not describe the efforts which were now made by the hangman and an assistant to force the prisoner down the trap, nor the struggles which the latter made in order to escape his fate. Suffice it that after several minutes had elapsed the work of strangulation was being accomplished. Nor shall we enter into the horrid details of the other\'s fate. Enough to say that again the rope broke, and again the unfortunate creature, amidst the groans of the crowd, underwent the fearful process, and on the third occasion the attempt proved successful. It is a curious incident that the impression left on the minds of the onlooking natives, and of the prisoner himself, was, that having committed three murders, he was to be hanged three times. So strong a sensation has this occurrence excited, that we hope there is little likelihood that such a tragedy will be enacted for the third time, and that in future the proper appliances will be provided. This is the proper place to state that criminal assaults upon European females have been frequently attempted of late by Kafirs, and the extreme punishment of the prisoner already mentioned was an example sternly demanded by law and by society.""\n\nThe following are our prices current: Butter, 1s. 3d. per lb.; bacon, 6d. to 10d. per lb.; hams, 1s. per lb.; cheese, 1s. per lb.'}, {'id': 546, 'article_title': 'Influence of the Colony of Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'Influence of the Colony of Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': 'The beneficial influence of Sierra Leone among the neighbouring heathen is shown by the following speech of the new king of the north Bullam Country and people.\n\nBrought out in regal attire, and shown to some 3,000 people of all ages—declared king—and the country being delivered into his keeping, he thus addressed his subjects:—\n\n""I thank God that He has raised me to sit on the throne of my ancestors, and I hope that I shall receive from the chiefs and people ample assistance and sound counsel in doing all that is required for the good government of our country.

If once such a system be allowed to pass unchallenged, it is impossible to assign any limits to the horrors that might be committed under the cloak of justice by such a governor and such a judge as we have above supposed might at some future time exercise concurrent jurisdiction in Sierra Leone. Any defender of public rights against the views of the Executive, any one who from whatever cause became obnoxious to the Executive, might become a helpless victim. This must not be. The public safety demands that it shall be made impossible. The power to execute a sentence of death without previous confirmation in England by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies must be taken away. We can imagine no circumstances, except where a colony is in a state of open rebellion, in which any evil can arise from such delay in executing a man who has been sentenced to death, while the enormous evil that may arise by leaving such powers of execution without previous reference to England, in the hands of any governor of such Crown colonies as those on the West Coast of Africa, must be evident to every one. A people jealous of its rights and liberties, and watchful over the priceless boon of individual and public security, will never fail to protest and appeal against any defect in the laws and regulations by which it is governed. There is a manifest danger lurking near every man in the Sierra Leone community. Will not that community, as one man, protest against its continuance? Will they not petition without loss of time for the removal of this threatening danger? We cannot think otherwise. And while we would have them petition the Colonial-office that the power to inflict the penalty of death under sentence of a local criminal court be no longer left in the hands of any local executive authority, but that in all such cases there should be a reference to England, and no execution of the sentence without express order from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, we would not have them content with this petition only. The matter is too grave; the danger is too terrible. The remedy is too indispensable to be allowed to depend on the fiat of the Colonial-office alone. It is a matter in which the Imperial Parliament, Lords and Commons, should be called upon to interfere; and we do most earnestly hope that petitions with this object, signed by every African in the colony—by every man who has African blood in his veins, will be speedily forwarded to us, in order to their presentation in both Houses of the Imperial Legislature. Until that power of carrying into effect a sentence of death passed by a local tribunal upon his own sole responsibility (which is no responsibility at all under such circumstances) be taken from the Head of the Executive in the West Coast Settlements, no man's life there can be looked upon as worth a single year's, aye, or even a single month's purchase."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1871#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trial and Execution of Whobay', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The impression left on our mind by a first reading of the proceedings and evidence against Whobay, and which led to our publishing in a supplement last month the details and remarks which appeared in the *West African Liberator*, has been more than confirmed by a further and closer examination. Unhappily, this account reaches us only when we are powerless for good as regards the man himself; *he has been executed.* We feel deeply the extreme gravity of the position in which this places us, in the observations which it is our duty to make. If this man has been improperly tried, convicted, and executed, he has been murdered. And where a man has been murdered there must necessarily be some one culpable. Is it, then, to be wondered at that we approach this matter with great pain? Who are the parties before us? A poor African—a cruel, blood-stained African, if you will—on the one hand; the executive and judicial authorities of Sierra Leone on the other: a native of a barbarous country and tribe, not living under British rule or laws, and brought 100 miles over the sea to be tried; an executive and judiciary representing, acting in the name and with the power of the Sovereign of a great civilised nation. What crime is this ""untutored savage"" charged with? Murder. On whom, where, and under what circumstances committed? On a child named Boye; in a native town or village under its old native chief, within and close to an imaginary and undefined line of demarcation between a territory ceded to Her Majesty by the King and chiefs of Bagroo in 1862; during a war excursion made by people of the neighbouring Imperah Country, by order of their chiefs. No British law had been at any time proclaimed in that town; no British authority, even the most mean, resided there, the people being under the rule and authority of their native chief, the same as before the cession; the only exception being that whenever any Sierra Leone or other born British subject felt himself aggrieved by this chief\'s decision, he could appeal to the British Civil Commandant at Sherbro, thirty miles off, for redress. The Boye alleged to be murdered was a child of this chief. Some dispute had become envenomed between this chief and the chiefs of the neighbouring Imperah Country, acknowledged to be *without* British jurisdiction, and these, according to the native way of making war, had by surprise attacked and taken this chief\'s town of Gondomah, and his wives and children captive; one of whom, this child Boye, was killed during the occupation by this Whobay, the son of an Imperah chief, alleged to be one of the war party, and the murder being, as further alleged, committed by his hand. This was on the 14th of March last. Early in May this man goes down to Bonthe, Sherbro; he is arrested, taken before the magistrate, Captain Walshe, committed for trial, and sent to Sierra Leone; tried there in May for the murder of one Patience Peters, a Sierra Leone woman, during that same war occupation of Gondomah; acquitted because of defective proof of jurisdiction; re-arrested immediately; recommitted by the police magistrate of Sierra Leone for the murder of this child Boye, and now, on the 21st October, brought once more before the Supreme Court for trial. If ever there were in any alleged criminal case circumstances to induce caution and even lenity on the part of the Executive, and a jealous watchfulness by the judges that the jurisdiction of a court should not be unduly stretched to bring the accused within the fatal meshes of the criminal law, surely such circumstances existed here. Do the proceedings as regards Whobay exhibit such caution, lenity, and watchfulness? Far from it; so far, indeed, that we feel compelled to seek motives for the absence of them. There seems to us to have been an eagerness for a conviction on the part of the Executive, well calculated in a Crown colony to poison and pollute the stream of justice; a foregone conclusion, and a determination not to be baulked of its prey, which is foreign to the spirit and practice of British institutions. We know the full force of what we say, but while it may please God to spare our life we will use all our endeavours to make pure and to keep pure the administration of justice in Africa, and to our view this purity cannot co-exist with the slightest tinge of passion. To us it appears distinct and clear that the criminal net has been criminally lengthened to include Whobay, in the same way that it was criminally lengthened by the executive and judicial authorities at Cape Coast in the case of Finlason. Although Mr. Rainy, who so praiseworthily fulfilled the duties of counsel for the prisoner, to which he was appointed by the Court, does not say this, we see that it was in the mind of the Editor of the *West African Liberator* when he wrote: ""Whether, under these circumstances, Whobay could be legally tried is a question that ought to have been set at rest as early as possible; it was frequently mooted by the prisoner\'s counsel during the trial, but it was overlooked, and his Honour the Chief Justice, in his charge to the jury, made no allusion to it, though we are impressed on public grounds that his honour should have expressed his opinion on the matters. His silence keeps us from expressing our opinion on it."" We see no necessity for any such reticence on our part. In the absence of any vindication by the judge of the jurisdiction of his court in this case, we, in our plain common-sense view, deny the competency of his court to try and pass sentence of death on Whobay. We deny that the murder of which he was accused—even were we to admit, which we do not, that he committed it—was a murder such as would bring the murderer within the action of the British Criminal Law. He was, if concerned in it, only so concerned as one of a war party sent by his superiors, the kings and chiefs of the Imperah Country to make war, according to African custom, upon the town of which the child Boye\'s father was native chief, and in which he was the sole authority; which war party collectively killed this child. The town thus made war upon was situate close to an undrawn and undefined line, supposed to divide the newly-acquired British territory in which it is claimed to be situate, from the Imperah Country, to which Whobay belonged, the Treaty of cession merely stating the boundary to be *about* thirty miles from Sherbro River, and *no survey to fix the boundary line* having since been made—no authoritative warning been given to the neighbouring independent chiefs never to pass that line with hostile intent. According to usage in Africa, as elsewhere, the British authorities at the Sherbro should have demanded atonement and compensated for the outrage from the Imperah chiefs, or proceeded forcibly to punish it, and to enforce such conditions as would have prevented any recurrence. Instead of this, the bright idea seized them to arrest this man when he comes peaceably down to their seat of rule; to charge him, who knew nothing of English language, law, or customs, with murder committed in that foray; and send him over the sea 100 miles to Sherbro to be tried for it in the regular British Criminal Court of the colony. Arrived there, the Executive Government bring him before the Supreme Court for trial. Of two witnesses brought forward by the Crown, one swore the murder with which he was then charged was committed within the thirty miles, the other that it was not within the thirty miles. The judge charged that if there was any doubt on this point the prisoner ought to have the benefit of it, and the jury acquitted him.

Now, there was a man who said, that in the night before the ordeal somebody had rubbed him with lemon juice; he did not know who it was, and could not help it. This was suspicious, and being closely questioned, his answers were not satisfactory. At length it turned out that he was the murderer, and not those men pointed out by the ordeal.

At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like. The revenue of the protectorate is derived from licenses and a house tax. The staff in each district consists of a District Commissioner, surgeon, and company of frontier police. Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security. The effect of the further establishment of British administration and tribunals has been the movement of a number of Natives from the coast into the interior with the purpose of trading, and there is therefore every hope of an increasing development of the natural products of the protectorate in the near future.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Late Trial at Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'viction of Williams and John will, we hope and believe, put an end to that idea of impunity, and tend to restrain the brutal instincts of men who, as natives of the British Settlements, claim the protection of the British Government without considering themselves to be in their own persons amenable to British laws. We will not unnecessarily shock our readers by a recapitulation of the abominable atrocities of which those men were found guilty. It was of a nature, unhappily, but too common in native Africa among the heathen populations; but that it should have been committed by men and women who had received Christian education in the Missionary Schools of Sierra Leone, and who, by a profession of Christian faith, had been admitted into the ranks of teachers of Christian faith and precepts, made it especially heinous, and its punishment especially desirable. We feel deeply for the Church Missionary Society in this unhappy matter, which must have inflicted the greatest pain on the members of a Committee who have done and are doing so much for the Christian education of the African people. That these gross offenders should have been trained in their institutions, and been deemed worthy to be employed as teachers of Christianity, will, we fear, be urged by enemies of Christian Missions as an evidence of the fruitlessness of Christian effort. Nothing can be more unjust than this; and if other evidence of its injustice were wanting, ample has been given by the general feeling of horror which the report of the atrocity gave rise to among the native Christians of Sierra Leone—a feeling which would never have existed, much less been manifested by any native African heathen community. All the reports that we have received are unanimous in their statement of the painful impression produced among the native Christians at Sierra Leone by the evidence of the shocking brutality committed on the person of the unfortunate victim—brutality so cold-blooded and pitiless that it seems strange to us how human beings who had been instructed in Christian precepts could have been guilty of it. The evidence was, however, too clear to admit of any doubt on the subject; and yet we have no hesitation in asserting that these gross offenders made such profession of Christian faith and principles as fully justified the Church Missionary authorities in admitting them into the glorious ranks of Christian teachers, without which they would never have been so honoured. Only the all-seeing eye of God could have known of the depravity that lay hidden in the secret recesses of the heart, waiting only favouring circumstances to enable it to reveal itself. We can only hope that the offenders will see the hand of God in the temporal punishment that has fallen upon them. We rejoice that their lives have been spared; that they were found guilty of manslaughter, and not of murder; and that, having, as they now have, time given them for repentance, they may by it obtain that pardon which embraced the malefactor on the cross at Calvary. Finally, we would say to the Church Missionary Society: ""Be not discouraged, because human wisdom is fallible. You have in the ranks of your native African teachers men who are working as zealously and as purely for their dear Lord and Master as any, even the most faithful, of the ministry in this favoured kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Old Calabar is one of these so-called ""Oil River"" Districts; and at Duke Town, which we suppose we must term its capital, one Oroks was lately crowned ""King"" by Consul Hewett. Some of our correspondents strongly condemned this measure, Oroks\' character not being such as to inspire any confidence that the laws and usages of civilization were likely to be honoured and followed by him. We considered the evidence to be very strong against him, but missionary matters being mixed up with the general public ones in our correspondents\' letters, we did not care to insert these in our columns. And now we have the most horrible account of an execution for murder in Duke Town. The particulars will be found in another column; we cannot recapitulate here. But as such atrocities could not possibly be practised under missionary approval, we cannot refrain from noticing the low condition of missionary influence in a small town which has now been some thirty-five years under missionary occupation and teaching. This evidence of the low state of missionary influence justifies all that we have ever written in favour of bringing Old Calabar and the other Oil Rivers under British rule. These trading stations are very expensive for Great Britain. The West African Squadron is principally occupied in keeping them open to trade, and in settling disputes in them between the natives and the European agents of European mercantile houses, while the revenues of Great Britain are not in any way benefited by the trade carried on there. Still, we would not complain of this if we could see that there was progress in civilization. We consider it a duty with which God has charged our country to promote the spread of Christian civilization wherever its influence extends, and can be made to prevail. We are not annexationists by territorial greed. Under our colonial system, the subjects of every country in the world can import and export on the same terms as British merchants, in all our colonies and possessions; and the West African colonies and settlements not affording any facilities for British colonization by natives of Great Britain and Ireland, the only pecuniary advantage Great Britain can derive by holding them can be that she thus prevents the shutting out of her own subjects from trade in them by hostile tariffs and exceptional charges and duties, so often employed against them in the colonial ports of other civilized Powers. To elucidate this, we have only to refer to the difference between French Senegal, from which British commerce is excluded, and the British Gambia, where French mercantile houses are now crowding out the British ones through the operation of differential duties in France, where the ground nuts of the Gambia are converted into Italian olive oil! No; there is no ""Jingoism"" or ""earth greed"" in our advocacy of the subjection of the Oil River districts to British rule, instead of, as now, to spasmodic British intervention. If occupied by Great Britain, or rather, if government in them was administered by Great Britain, Customs\' duties might be made to pay the cost, instead of its falling, as now, upon the Imperial Exchequer; the worst atrocities of heathenism would be put an end to, as Suttee was suppressed in India, and as human sacrifices have been prevented in the Gold Coast districts; and civilization on the basis of Christianity would be gradually propagated, as it has been in other British settlements on the West Coast. Before closing these hasty remarks on a subject of great importance, we cannot refrain from noticing that the person said to have been murdered by the slave who was afterwards so cruelly put to death, is characterized as a ""Christian,"" and that the terms employed respecting him are such as are generally used about Sierra Leone young men. Was this, then, another instance of slave-holding practices by Sierra Leone men—therefore British subjects—professing Christianity? We fear it was, because we have but too much reason to know that not a few Sierra Leone men, educated in Mission schools, do not hesitate, when in heathen trading towns, to buy and hold slaves. May we suggest to the British Consul having jurisdiction in the Oil Rivers to examine into this matter of slave-holding by Sierra Leone educated Africans—British subjects—who are ever ready to claim British protection even when by slave-holding they are violating British laws. We have the firm belief that Africa can only be civilized and Christianized by Christian Africans; and this gives additional importance to a matter on which we think deeply.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1883#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATED SIERRA LEONE BRITISH SUBJECTS AND SLAVE DEALING.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The publication of the official Correspondence relative to the case of the slave girl in whose murder at Onitsha on the Niger two coloured men, named John and Williams, formerly in the service of the Church Missionary Society, were implicated, is calculated to deepen the feeling of indignation with which that brutal crime was regarded by the public when the facts of the case were first made known. The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

This foreign interference intensified in proportion to the settlers' increasing need for cheap indigenous labour to work on the farms and in the mines, and for the hut tax to meet at least part of the administrative expenses. Africans were compelled to vacate their homelands to make room for white settlers and to serve as army 'volunteers'. In Rhodesia (Northern and Southern) and Nyasaland, the Chartered Company administrators simply trans› planted the 'Native Laws' of South Africa. In Rhodesia, where white settle› ment was the heaviest, the administration tolerated no obstacles to its economic ventures, even if these obstacles were Shona lives and rights. It readily commandeered Shona lands, livestock, crops and stores of food and subjected the Shona to forced labour to serve the interest of the settlers, who had been drawn to Mashonaland with promises of a better, easier and richer way of life.

Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

They believed in the unquestionable superiority of the white race, culture and religion, and they viewed colonization, commerce and Christianity as inseparable allies. At the same time they also emphasized the need for imperial responsibility (paternal guardianship) over the Africans. They sought to smooth cultural contact between the colonizer and the colonized and to 'protect' and 'civilize' the African in an effort to make him a more useful member of the new colonial community.

The Yaka periodically fled across the Kwango River which separated Angola and the Congo, while their compatriots took advantage of the unpatrolled frontier to cross into the French Congo where they remained until harassed by local tax officials. 37 A similar strategy was employed by disenchanted members of the rural populations living in the Milanje region along the Nyasaland-Mozambique border and in the Gaerezi Valley separating Rhodesia and Mozambique."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

They were committed to constitutionalism, gradualism, and cultural assimilation as advocated by a few white liberals among the settlers. But they also were disciples of Booker T. Washington's doctrine of black economic self-determination and of his conservative politics of accommodation.\nLike the missionaries, they often categorized the African masses as 'benighted people' and 'noble savages' and then assumed the responsibility of overhauling traditional Africa through introducing Christianity, educa› tion, capitalism, industrialization, and the Protestant work ethic.

Again, Kafir law is dispensed among the natives by Europeans, and by their own chiefs. And in the colonists\' disputes with the natives there is great uncertainty as to the law by which the case has to be determined. And natives who have become civilised repudiate the barbarous Kafir law. A meeting of native delegates from mission stations has protested against it. Some of their speeches were very characteristic and forcible. The following, by a delegate named Johannes, is a fair and interesting specimen: ""We are here met to attempt to decide a question which I will endeavour to put as clearly as I can. We have left the race of our forefathers; we have left the black race, and have clung to the white. We imitate them in everything we can. We feel we are in the midst of a civilised people, and that when we became converts to their faith we belonged to them. It was as a stone thrown into the water, impossible to return. You have all left different savage races to come to Natal. We have all been well received—not as dogs, but as people. We have been protected since, and are happy. One thing alone detracts from our security. The law by which cases are decided is only fit to be eaten by vultures. Who will say Kafir law is good, when we see thousands flying every day from it to the refuge of the wings of the Englishman? The question for us to decide is, whether we will have Kafir or English law? We have left the black race—it is impossible to return. We are under the wing of the Queen—let us ask her for the law. Look round you. You have an English house; English tables, chairs—everything round us is English but one, and that is the law. Do not think I would say that the present law in Natal is not perfection compared to the law we have left. Who has ever heard in Natal the cry of ""Kill the witch!"" Who has had his cattle slaughtered because his chief was hungry, since we came under the shadow of Victoria\'s wing? Yet the law is bad. Let me put a case. I quarrel with a black man. I go to law. What do I find? An Induna. I speak my case to him. His answer is a stroke of the chin. I am told to return to-morrow; and this goes on for a month. Have I not left my plough? Have I not walked ten miles a day for a month? Who pays me for my time lost, my money spent, and my heart hardened? Let us represent this evil to our superiors. Let us tell them we have left the black race, and belong to them. Will they send us back to barbarity? They may send our bodies, but our spirits they cannot send. Our spirits belong to civilization, though our bodies are the colour of the earth. I can say no more than this."" We are glad to see this protest of civilised Kafirs against even a modified Kafir law. This demand of English law by them is a good sign.

It always pains us when we are compelled to arraign individuals at the bar of public opinion. With the present state and condition of the African settlements this, however, is from time to time inevitable. Individuals have so much influence for good or evil. Years ago we protested against the undue and evil influence in the Protected Territories of the Gold Coast of Mr. J. B. M'Intyre and other employes of Messrs. Foster and Smith, of London. They had then four or five seats in the small Legislative Council, and through the vices or weaknesses of Government officials they really ruled those countries so far as it suited their purpose or interests. They and their doings became thus really public property. The power and evil influence of Mr. M'Intyre were unbounded. To offend him was perdition; not to be subservient to him was very little less. Mr. Andrews and Mr. Richard Pyne, as Governors, were both ruined by yielding and becoming subservient to that influence; respectable private traders were swept away by it; it was a dragon as bad on the Gold Coast as the fabled one killed by St. George was in the districts he tyrannised over; and men wondered when a Cape Coast St. George would come. Judge Hackett worshipped it; military judges and magistrates were its allies; Magistrate Parker even, with brandy bottle in hand, would not do battle with it. Had it a charmed life, and was it immortal? Not quite this. Though officially and judicially untouched, men saw signs of decay; it seemed to be destroying itself by its own wanton and ungovernable excesses; its teeth were falling out one by one, and its claws were becoming weak and rotten. At length, in the instinct of self-preservation, some mustered up courage to beard it; yet the prestige inspired by former dreadful exploits made it still terrible until the long expected St. George came upon the scene. Driven out by Downing-street from the Gambia, because he manfully refused to be an unscrupulous whitewasher of Admiral Patey in his Bathurst Gaol enormities, Mr. Chalmers arrived at Cape Coast as Chief Magistrate. We may confess that, although we esteemed him for his conduct in the Patey affair, we had our doubts about him, for reasons which we thought justified our suspicions, but which it is not necessary here to explain. We rejoice, however, to say that, as far as we have yet seen, those doubts and suspicions were unfounded. Men at Cape Coast saw a painstaking, patient, diligent judge, who studiously avoided all intimacies that might in any way throw discredit on his judicial decisions; a feeling of confidence in British justice began to revive; men gathered courage to oppose powerful extortioners, and to bring their own counter-complaints before the Chief Magistrate's tribunal. The result seems not to have disappointed those who knew they had right on their side. Among evil influences maimed or destroyed, that of the great dragon before mentioned has not escaped. In our last we inserted a letter dated Cape Coast, February 16, in which some brief particulars were given of the cases Ferguson v. M'Intyre, and Davis v. M'Intyre. With Ferguson it was a matter of life or death, and little less so with Davis, against whom M'Intyre had also brought proceedings. Ferguson appears to have given M'Intyre a mortgage on his house, &c., at Cape Coast as security, upon it being alleged by M'Intyre that there was a heavy balance against him. One morning notices of sale of this house were found posted in Cape Coast for payment of 380l., alleged to be due by Ferguson to M'Intyre. Ferguson's accounts showed to him very different results. He therefore moved for an injunction. It was granted. The Court appointed an accountant to examine. And what was the final judgment of the Court? That instead of Ferguson owing M'Intyre 380l., M'Intyre owed Ferguson 50l. 7s. 2d. The case of the scandalously oppressed and ill-treated Joseph Smith has also been before the Court. This poor man has indeed suffered most cruel injustice at the hands of successive administrators of the law at Cape Coast. We examined his evidence and statements in 1865, and were so fully satisfied that he had been unjustly imprisoned, and that because of the evil influence we have alluded to justice was iniquitously denied him at Cape Coast, that we endeavoured to get his case brought into the London courts, for setting aside the judgment against him and obtaining a righteous decision in his affairs. But it was decided the courts here had not any jurisdiction, and if a righteous magistrate had not at last found his way to the Cape Coast bench, he would never have escaped from the legal slough into which the evil influence, and conniving legal and other officials had plunged him. Compensatory justice he cannot now ever hope to obtain; liberating justice we thank God that, through Mr. Chalmers, he has obtained. Made a bankrupt at the suit of Messrs. Foster and Smith or their agents in 1861, he has suffered uninterrupted persecution and wrong. It clearly appears now, from the portion of evidence procurable, that his estate, if it had been righteously administered, would have paid 15s. in the pound. We believe from what came before us it would have paid 20s., with a not inconsiderable surplus. And yet this man has by local official and judicial tyranny, disgraceful to Great Britain, been treated like one of the vilest of felons; had his home desolated, his children murdered (for when deaths result from iniquitous oppression the victims are really murdered, though there be no human punishment for the murderers), and never until the 17th January last could he obtain his discharge.

Smith never received any subsistance money during this time, though his estate is acknowledged to have yielded 13,000l. During the greater part of the nine years Mr. M'Intyre was sole assignee. After Mr. Chalmers had granted Smith's discharge, in the teeth of a violent opposition by Mr. M'Intyre and the counsel he employed, he made an order directing Mr. M'Intyre to produce in court all books, papers, and accounts in his hands as assignee, as well as an account of the assets that had passed through his hands; in fact, all accounts connected with the estate from 1861 to the said 17th January 1870.

Five white farmers were charged with tying up natives and cruelly flogging them. Two of the natives were so badly injured that they had to be removed to hospital, and one of them died of blood poisoning resulting from his wounds. The defendants were indicted for culpable homicide in the one case, and assault in respect of the others; and the Solicitor-General, who prosecuted for the Crown, described the narrative as exhibiting ""a monotony of brutality.""\n\nFor the defence it was alleged that nothing more than a ""common assault"" had been committed, and only by one of the farmers, Mr. J. P. T. Hart. Mr. Hart himself gave evidence, in which he said that he had only used a ""reim,"" not a ""sjambok,"" in flogging the natives, who had been killing valuable sheep belonging to him. His anger at his losses had something to do with the severity of the punishment. The jury found the defendants guilty of ""common assault under great provocation,"" but acquitted them altogether on the other indictment.\n\nMr. Justice Jones, while admitting that there was some reason for the merciful view taken by the jury regarding the former charge, characterised the verdict of acquittal on the charge of homicide as ""a disgrace to the community."" For the assault, Hart was fined £125 or fifteen months\' imprisonment, and the other sentences varied from £45 to £100.\n\nThe Judge\'s comments are strongly endorsed by a portion of the colonial Press, and resented by another section. The *Cape Times* says the jury decided that killing was no murder. The effect of the trial on the native mind cannot fail to be mischievous and disquieting. They ""will see that they are liable to punishment without law, without proof of guilt, without fair inquiry of any sort, and that against such violence they are practically left without protection. The only remedy seems to be abandonment of trial by jury, and the establishment of a special Court, as on the diamond fields, or the adjudication of cases subject to the influence of racial prejudice."" The *Eastern Province Herald*, while agreeing that men must not take the law into their own hands, calls upon the Government to suppress the crime which led to the present case.

Kidd and M'Coskry, of Liverpool. His victim was a little girl eight years of age. We cannot enter into the filthy details, though all the evidence is before us. He was tried on the 6th of the present month. The result is, in our opinion, disgraceful to the jury, and not so creditable as we could wish to the judge. How any jury could, upon the evidence, have acquitted Lubley of the *rape*, when among other conclusive evidence it was proved that the poor child was bleeding during four days, we cannot possibly conceive. But we hope to get some explanation of this. Having, however, thus escaped upon the capital charge, he pleaded *Guilty* to that of criminal assault with attempt, &c.; and here, again, his good fortune did not desert him. The judge sentenced him to *four months' imprisonment*, with hard labour.

They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

""A young man, by name Moses (R. E. Moses), purchased a cask or two of rum from one of the wholesale merchants in this town. At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Infamous Africans Deserving Severe Punishment', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Daniel Josiah, formerly a washerman, at present a balance-broker, and Charles Allen, a well-known fisherman, of Wilberforce, Sierra Leone, somehow become a native of Lagos.

With regard to the alleged outrages by missionaries on natives of Africa, that is, by members of the Blantyre mission, to which Dr. Cameron called the particular attention of the House of Commons—outrages of which, he said, the missionaries confessed they had been guilty, but which they attempted to justify—we must say that we agree with Mr. J. Campbell, that while a hasty judgment ought not to be passed, there cannot be a shadow of doubt that it is wrong for missionaries to assume criminal jurisdiction over the natives of uncivilized countries. The Blantyre missionaries, like all other ministers of Protestant missions, are supposed to have gone forth among the heathen to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation, and to preach the Gospel of peace and love, not to administer human justice, and to shoot and flog offenders to death. In that the Blantyre missionaries have admitted (if it be so) ""that collisions with the natives had taken place, and lives had been lost in their attempts to establish criminal jurisdiction,"" they certainly have thus condemned themselves as missionaries; and the sooner the mission is withdrawn from the field in which it has thus departed from the legitimate sphere of missionary action the better. But we are, nevertheless, far from thinking that the Blantyre missionaries, however much they may have erred as missionaries, have made themselves amenable to the provisions of the 24th and 25th Victoria, c. 100, sec. 9, as having committed the crimes of murder and manslaughter contemplated by that Act of Parliament; and still less can we agree with Dr. Cameron in his contention ""that whenever uncivilized people need chastisement, that chastisement shall only be inflicted by authorised persons, and that no traveller should be allowed to take upon himself the power of life and death."" By ""authorised persons"" Dr. Cameron evidently meant persons holding powers of jurisdiction under the British Crown, or under some other civilized power than that of Great Britain; and he seemed to think that the strongest application of such law to British subjects would facilitate ""the march of exploration and research."" Traders, travellers, and explorers in uncivilized countries may be truly said to carry their lives in their hands. They are always warned that from the moment they pass beyond the boundaries of countries over which the jurisdiction of civilized powers extend, they do so at their own risk and peril. They are, in fact, thrown upon their own resources for their own protection; and as a general rule it will be found that if they commit acts of violence, except in strict self-defence, they themselves perish as a consequence of that violence. It has been held, as a general principle of British and all civilized law, that responsibility goes with protection, but does not extend beyond the limits of protection; and although there has been an attempt to extend responsibility beyond the limits of protection, as under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 41, 2 Vic. c. 67, alluded to by Sir C. Dilke, which gives power to issue an order in Council for the exercise of British jurisdiction over British subjects abroad, Her Majesty\'s Government has never seen fit to use the powers given under that Act; nor will they, we think, ever see fit to exercise it so as to take from travellers and explorers in uncivilized countries the right of self-defence against the attacks of savages whose countries they may be traversing. To take from them this right—to lay down as a rule of law that if they cause the death of one or more savages in self-defence they have been guilty of the crime of murder, punishable by death under British law, would be to put an end to exploration in uncivilized countries altogether, instead of facilitating it, as Dr. Cameron seemed inclined to contend. No one can deprecate acts of violence more than we do—in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they are as unnecessary as they are unchristian; but if we are asked whether we had rather that the great discovery of the source of the River Congo should never have been made, than that the lives of a certain number of opposing cannibals, clamorous for human flesh, should have been sacrificed by Stanley in forcing his way down that great stream, the knowledge of the true course and importance of which may lead to the redemption of extensive countries from loathsome barbarism by the diffusion of Christianity and civilization among their inhabitants, we are in conscience compelled to admit that, although we deplore that any human life, whether of the explorers or their opponents, should have been sacrificed in the course of that great discovery, we hold that sacrifice to have been insignificant and unworthy of notice in view of the enormous results that may, and will, accrue from that discovery. Even the most patient and Christian of all known explorers in Africa, the lamented Dr. Livingstone, did not deprecate the use of violence in cases of necessity, and thought it well that the English should be known as people who can hit hard when unjustly attacked. Either we must condemn the whole of those vast interior countries of Africa to unmitigated barbarism for yet a long succession of ages, or we must be prepared for occasional acts of violence in self-defence on the part of travellers and explorers. With all respect to Dr. Cameron, nothing can, in our opinion, be more ridiculous than to lay down as a rule that whenever uncivilized people need chastisement it should be inflicted by authorised persons. If Stanley had given up himself and his followers, for whose life and well-being he was responsible, unresistingly into the hands of the cannibals of the Congo, and he and they had been eaten accordingly, does Dr. Cameron pretend to believe that, in the improbable event of the news that Stanley and his people had been cooked and eaten having ever reached this country, the British Government would have fitted out an expedition to chastise those wretchedly uncivilized people? The idea is absurd. We should have been told that before Stanley undertook such an expedition he should have counted the cost; that he had thrust himself into danger without adequate means of self-defence, and had paid the penalty of his rashness. We think Dr. Cameron did well to bring before the House the alleged exercise of criminal jurisdiction by the Blantyre missionaries, who were not sent forth for purposes of exploration or discovery, or to found a colony, but simply to endeavour to propagate the truths and doctrines of Christianity. We have no desire to see Protestant missionaries following the course of the Jesuit missions to Paraguay and elsewhere. If it be indispensable to the establishment and maintenance of a mission station in East Central Africa, that the missionaries should do such things as the Blantyre missionaries are stated to have done, and to have admitted that they have done, it only makes good the opinion we have at all times expressed, that there can be no satisfactory missionary establishments among the heathen, except where there is a basis of British Power; and that British missionary efforts among the heathen can only be safely or beneficially undertaken where there is such a basis of power. The uncivilized Africans, like, and perhaps even more than, all other uncivilized people, believe only in ""power."" They have no respect for anything but power. They do not understand or believe in generosity or forbearance; these they look upon as evidence of weakness, which they despise; and we sincerely believe that...\n91', 'last_edit_date': '1880-08-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native African Customs.—Advantages of British Protection', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—At Aburi a woman was murdered some four months ago, and nobody knew who was the culprit.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction.

When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also. Frequently these palavers occupy much of our time, but it is not time lost; for it increases our influence for good amongst them, and often saves greater evils and the depression and stoppage of trade, both among themselves and between them and the European merchants.""', 'last_edit_date': '1871-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Late Trial at Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'viction of Williams and John will, we hope and believe, put an end to that idea of impunity, and tend to restrain the brutal instincts of men who, as natives of the British Settlements, claim the protection of the British Government without considering themselves to be in their own persons amenable to British laws. We will not unnecessarily shock our readers by a recapitulation of the abominable atrocities of which those men were found guilty. It was of a nature, unhappily, but too common in native Africa among the heathen populations; but that it should have been committed by men and women who had received Christian education in the Missionary Schools of Sierra Leone, and who, by a profession of Christian faith, had been admitted into the ranks of teachers of Christian faith and precepts, made it especially heinous, and its punishment especially desirable. We feel deeply for the Church Missionary Society in this unhappy matter, which must have inflicted the greatest pain on the members of a Committee who have done and are doing so much for the Christian education of the African people. That these gross offenders should have been trained in their institutions, and been deemed worthy to be employed as teachers of Christianity, will, we fear, be urged by enemies of Christian Missions as an evidence of the fruitlessness of Christian effort. Nothing can be more unjust than this; and if other evidence of its injustice were wanting, ample has been given by the general feeling of horror which the report of the atrocity gave rise to among the native Christians of Sierra Leone—a feeling which would never have existed, much less been manifested by any native African heathen community. All the reports that we have received are unanimous in their statement of the painful impression produced among the native Christians at Sierra Leone by the evidence of the shocking brutality committed on the person of the unfortunate victim—brutality so cold-blooded and pitiless that it seems strange to us how human beings who had been instructed in Christian precepts could have been guilty of it. The evidence was, however, too clear to admit of any doubt on the subject; and yet we have no hesitation in asserting that these gross offenders made such profession of Christian faith and principles as fully justified the Church Missionary authorities in admitting them into the glorious ranks of Christian teachers, without which they would never have been so honoured. Only the all-seeing eye of God could have known of the depravity that lay hidden in the secret recesses of the heart, waiting only favouring circumstances to enable it to reveal itself. We can only hope that the offenders will see the hand of God in the temporal punishment that has fallen upon them. We rejoice that their lives have been spared; that they were found guilty of manslaughter, and not of murder; and that, having, as they now have, time given them for repentance, they may by it obtain that pardon which embraced the malefactor on the cross at Calvary. Finally, we would say to the Church Missionary Society: ""Be not discouraged, because human wisdom is fallible. You have in the ranks of your native African teachers men who are working as zealously and as purely for their dear Lord and Master as any, even the most faithful, of the ministry in this favoured kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In our desire to do justice, we printed one communication, in which one of the inculpated ministers distinctly stated that the charge of his possessing slaves was false, whereas the same individual subsequently confessed in Lagos to having nineteen, when, their names having been all given, he could no longer conceal the fact. In a short letter from another, which will appear in this number if we have space for it, there is no repetition of any such denial, but a statement that they are willing to give up their slaves. We hope the result will be that a new era of goodwill commence in Abeokuta, though we confess we agree with ""Owuyeh"" that the withdrawal of the Rev. James Johnson from the superintendence of the interior is not calculated to forward the great ends the Church Missionary Society have in view.

770,British colonial rule significantly influenced local governance and legal systems in Aquapem and the Gold Coast by integrating traditional practices with English legal standards and prioritizing European officials in judicial roles.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British colonial rule significantly influenced local governance and legal systems in Aquapem and the Gold Coast by integrating traditional practices with English legal standards and prioritizing European officials in judicial roles. The General History of Africa highlights the British strategy of incorporating traditional practices with English legal norms through the establishment of 'native courts' under Lugard's indirect rule. These courts adhered to African customary law, modified only when conflicting with fundamental English principles, and were presided over by Africans, primarily handling domestic affairs. This reflects a blend of traditional and English legal practices. However, the text also underscores the prioritization of European officials in judicial roles, as seen in the dyarchical judicial arrangement where criminal law and litigation involving Europeans were under colonial jurisdiction. The British government's decision to resume direct control of coastal settlements in 1843, governed by a legal convention among chiefs recognizing British law, further supports this prioritization. The African Times articles complement these insights by detailing instances such as the King of Aquapem referencing English laws in local disputes, indicating the integration of English legal standards. They also highlight the appointment of Europeans, like the Queen's Advocate, and the presence of British judges and magistrates, illustrating the prioritization of European officials. The articles discuss challenges in applying English law, such as partial application and resulting injustices, while acknowledging the need to legalize native authority within defined limits, suggesting a complex interaction between traditional governance and colonial rule. Together, these sources illustrate the significant British influence on local governance and legal systems through the integration of traditional practices with English legal standards and the prioritization of European officials, while recognizing the ongoing role of traditional practices.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights that align with the claim regarding British colonial rule's influence on local governance and legal systems in the Gold Coast, including Aquapem.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""Maclean's career3 blossomed after the new retreat of the British govern¬ ment, which, caught up between its embarrassing allies on the coast and the fighting spirit of Asante, felt that the Gold Coast was too expensive in terms of money and human lives despite the British victory at Dodowa. Maclean, President of the Council of Merchants that provided the local administration of the forts, could therefore give free reign to his business acumen and knowledge of people, often disregarding official instructions from London, where a committee of merchants once again had charge of the forts. He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

The result was that throughout the nineteenth century, and even during the early part of this century, the new and old elites built up a tradition of co-operation - the new elite being regarded as those who mediated between their indigenous societies and western culture. After all they had been enabled to learn the new techniques in order to help their people meet the problems posed by European presence. In the Gold Coast and in Egbaland (Nigeria) they had worked closely with the traditional elite in an effort to build a new society and ward off European rule. But these efforts had failed.\nHowever, as colonial rule took deeper root, strains and stresses appeared in the relationship of the two groups. The new elites had wrongly hoped that Europe was out to modernize Africa and would use members of their group as the instruments for achieving that goal. But under colonial rule it was European bureaucrats who assumed the role which the new elites had cut out for themselves. And instead of taking the new elites into partnership, the administration tended to prefer the traditional rulers whom they relegated to the area of local government. This was particularly so in British-ruled Africa where a determined effort was made to preserve the old ruling families and to some extent in Belgian-ruled Africa after 1906. Even in the French territories where most of the great paramountcies were destroyed, the old ruling families at times survived in attenuated forms to be used at the village and district levels.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The decision to abolish the slave trade by Britain in 1807 was an important factor for change. Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states.

For example, in 1827 a naval squadron was stationed at Fernando Po, and in 1849,$^{ tne}$ & $^{TSt}$ British consul, John Beecroft, was appointed for the entire territories of the Bights of Benin and Bonny. The Court of Mixed Commissions was also set up at Freetown, Sierra Leone, to try the captains of captured slave ships, and to set free the slaves of condemned slavers. For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 260, 'article_title': 'Native Administration of Justice on the Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Native Administration of Justice on the Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-26', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'On the 15th August a very singular case was brought before Quaw Dade, King of Aquapem.

(A man had killed his wife in a town, Adukurom, in the same week, and ran away.) The other from Date answered, ""No, I am no murderer; I have been just working for a friend of mine, and afterwards have been looking for a few sticks to build a hut for me and my family, for we are now living in a farm not very far from hence; but I have lost my way, and as it is now getting dark, I am going to the village from whence you are coming to sleep there to-night, and return to-morrow morning to my family.""

All the laws and customs may be caused to be first written for the information and guidance of the Lieutenant-Governor, or they may be noted down as they are brought under notice in the course of appeal. The latter may, perhaps, be the better course; but I think it is essentially necessary that the laws and customs, swept of all their superfluous atrocities or injustice, should become laws and customs for the black and the white alike. I was going to say that they should become laws and customs by which the black and the white may be guided alike. I humbly submit that the ends of justice cannot otherwise be better served; for hitherto the natives have had to appeal to purely English laws—laws which they did not understand, of which they were ignorant, which were foreign, and which were satisfactory to none but lawyers, licensed advocates, and attorneys.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-08-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native Authorities', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The matter treated of by our Accra correspondent in the letter which we have now inserted, is not unworthy the attentive consideration of the Gold Coast Executive and of Her Majesty\'s Government. The British sovereign being now the supreme authority over the whole of the Protected Territories of the Gold Coast Colony, and all judicial and administrative authority exercised therein being only so exercised by permission of, or direct appointment from, the Gold Coast Executive, there can, we think, be no doubt that it is advisable, both in the interest of the native kings and chiefs who govern, and of the people who are governed, that the individuals who have the right to govern, and the exact limits of their jurisdiction and responsibility, should be fixed and determined in every province or district throughout those Territories. Owing to the Protection, and the restraining influence of British authority, those Territories now enjoy a peace and security for life and property never before known in any part of Native Africa. Although nothing has been done by the British Government to destroy the baleful superstitions that have been the curse of the country from time immemorial, and the people are still bound to a fearful degree by their chains, the powers of the fetish priests, and of the kings and chiefs who slavishly, or for motives of personal gain, or hatred or revenge, executed their murderous behests, has been so restrained by the almost certainty of punishment, that the deadly sting of these superstitions has been extracted; so that where hundreds of most atrocious murders would otherwise, as of old, be sickening the heart of humanity, not one is now perpetrated. This fact alone ought, when adduced, to be considered a sufficient answer to those who dare to call in question the alleged benefits of British rule in West Africa. We are far from saying that all the good that might have been done has been effected by that rule; but that an enormous amount of good has resulted from it, both directly and indirectly, is unquestionable. While, however, admitting and asserting this, we do not the less press for the increase and extension of that good; and such extension and increase are comparatively much easier to effect than was that amount of good of which they are to be the legitimate developments. One great good that may be effected is, as our correspondent ""Charity"" points out, in legalizing native authority within certain well-defined limits throughout the Protected Territories.

In ordinary cases they submit. It is cheaper for them to do so than to resist. But in consequence of the absence of territorial right beyond the narrow limits of the forts and settlements, judges and magistrates holding their authority from the British Crown are placed in the disgraceful and dishonouring position of being compelled to use their authority for the enforcement of native laws diametrically at variance with those of Great Britain. Under their mandate, runaway slaves are delivered up to their masters; and every wife and concubine, be it remembered, is a slave! We have lately seen in our columns under what circumstances of atrocity this had been done at Accra. British authorities do at the Gold Coast, under orders from England—which it would be impossible to justify—what, if done elsewhere without orders, would subject them to criminal prosecution and severe punishment. British authority is thus made the minister and upholder of slavery, polygamy, and other atrocities of heathenism and barbarism; too often even, it is to be feared, the involuntary abettor of murder and superstitious human sacrifice. Meanwhile, with a few honourable exceptions, the British employés, civil and military, as well as mercantile agents, have acted as if they were sent out to carry on a propaganda of drunkenness and debauchery. The climate, and the necessities which the climate is supposed to engender, have been urged and seemingly admitted, as an excuse for every kind of vicious excess. We have a host of concurrent testimony that the greater portion of the deaths which have occurred among Europeans in these settlements, and elsewhere on the West Coast, have been not from climate per se, but from climate acting upon persons improperly selected, brought from other enervating climates (such as the West Indies, &c.), with constitutions impaired, or upon systems vitiated and enfeebled by abominable impurity and dissipation. It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents. According to the custom of the country, these are marriages; but the Europeans contracting these alliances consider them as only a temporary convenience; and for the most part, when they leave the Coast to return to England, not only are the women abandoned, but the children born of them also, without any provision being made for them, and seemingly without remorse on the part of him who leaves them.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Gold Coast settlements have belonged to England for 120 years, and until 1843 the government was satisfactorily administered by a company of merchants, and was then taken over by the Crown. The British jurisdiction extends over a territory of about 6,000 square inches, and a population computed at about 275,000 natives. The trade of the Gold Coast has doubled during the last ten years. In 1871, the imports, according to the Gold Coast Customs returns, amounted to 250,000l., and the exports to 378,000l.; but according to the British Customs Blue Book, the exports from this country alone amounted to 477,000l.

They complain bitterly of the ordinances passed by the Council in which only one of their members has a voice.

The civil establishments form the principal charge on the funds of the Colony: public works, the colonial hospital, transport, and other expenses consequent on the recent disturbances, both in the neighbourhood of the settlements and on other parts of the coast where the Colony has been called upon to contribute aid, with the usual demands for police, gaols, aborigines, &c., make up the annual expenditure, which, unfortunately, the year's revenue is rarely able to meet—the result is, as shown in the Return No. 7 (Appendix), that on the 1st January in the present year the colony had incurred liabilities beyond its power to defray, to the amount of 5,630l.\n\nThere is no chance that this state of things will be remedied until the Colony learns to appreciate the necessity of regulating its expenditure by its power of raising revenue, nor need this be a very difficult task. The revenue derived from customs in 1862 was 8,314l., raised by a duty on declared imports to the value of 99,825l.; in the following year, an export duty having been substituted for the import duty, the revenue raised was 10,125l.; but, had the import duty been continued, and those precautions taken to protect the Colony against fraud which it should be in the power of every Government to adopt, the duty, at the previous import rates, which would have been payable on imports to the value of 175,896l. would have been 14,634l., giving a clear gain of revenue of upwards of 4,500l. in that one year, which would have gone some considerable way towards paying off the liabilities of the Colony. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the present mode of raising the revenue has much to recommend it on the score of fairness, and that it has as yet been attended with some success.\n\nBritish law is administered in the Colony through the agency of a supreme court, which sits periodically at Bathurst, and is presided over by the chief justice; of a court of requests; and a police magistrate's court.

There were many reasons, and very serious ones, why this was imperatively called for. Because the Fort at Quitta got into grievous disrepair some ten years ago, the small detachment of West India troops until that time stationed there was withdrawn. The natives then fell gradually under the influence of Ashanti, with whom they formed alliance; and to whom they were of essential use in the supply of arms and munitions of war, as well as of many useful articles. We dare not say much about the slave sales of boys and girls which they also made there, seeing that similar atrocities were permitted at Cape Coast, where the British Government had its chief seat of authority. Having an immunity from the import duties which were levied at all the ports on the western side of the Volta by the British authorities, these trans-Volta districts enjoyed advantages in trade, which led to the settlement of not a few traders there. The accounts which reached us from time to time were of a very unsatisfactory nature; strongly elucidating that, however satisfactory these trading operations in native territory might be to men or firms who made themselves powerful, and could sufficiently bribe the native kings and chiefs, they were far from being so to the weaker traders, who, when wronged (and this was of but too frequent occurrence), were entirely at their mercy, and almost hopeless of obtaining redress. It was with the utmost satisfaction, therefore, that we learned of the extension of British authority, occupation, and rule to these districts, as recognized integral portions of the new Gold Coast Colony. It would have been unfair to the countries west of the Volta, that they should be subject to heavy import duties on certain articles, while their neighbours on the east side of that river, and trading with the same people in the interior, were free from such duties. We naturally expected that the imposition of duties at Jellah Coffee, Quitta, &c., would at first cause some dissatisfaction; but we believed this would be but transient, and that counterbalancing advantages derived from the presence of British authority, if that authority were judiciously exercised, would soon reconcile all the hitherto oppressed and wronged; whatever it might do with the oppressors and wrongdoers, who would naturally dislike the curb thus placed in their mouths, to restrain them in the indulgence of their unjust greediness. The first account we have received of proceedings in the Court of the British Civil Commandant, fully justifies the expectations we entertained. We do not know anything of the parties concerned, or of the merits of the dispute between them. All we can see is, that the one who had been placed in log by native authority, has had judgment in his favour by the British Commandant after a patient hearing; and that the decision was received with joy by the natives, who felt grateful to the Queen for having sent her authority among them. It is not difficult to understand this. The native courts everywhere are well understood to be subservient to those who can pay best, as against those who cannot afford to pay. The weak find little or no protection in them; and the change from this to the decision in a British court, in cases where there cannot, by any possibility, be a suspicion or charge of undue partiality on the part of the magistrate or judge, must commend itself to the public sentiment. We feel that there must be a great arrear of unredressed wrong, of postponed justice, in these trans-Volta seaports; and we expect to hear of many other cases not essentially differing from that of Bruce v. Williams. There are not any powerful English firms there, whose influence might be supposed, as sometimes at Cape Coast and Lagos, to warp and bias the mind of the presiding judicial authority; and we have, therefore, every reason to expect decisions in disputed cases, which will give general satisfaction; together with a feeling of security on the part of the weaker members of the community, which will be well worth the payment of regulated Customs' duties, and be, indeed, thus very cheaply purchased. All that will be wanting there, as in the older settlements, will be the occasional visits of a Circuit Judge, who would correct any error into which the local authority may have fallen. We rejoice over this extension of British authority among the sea-coast populations between the River Volta, and the territory of Dahomey, and look for a great tide of prosperity, and advance of civilization in those districts."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It was governed by its native king, who was placed on the throne, after the expulsion of the usurper, by the efforts of the British squadron, and was maintained in that position by the same power, and lastly it had the assistance, as British Consuls, of men of ability and local experience, who exerted themselves in every way to promote its prosperity and advancement. The result has been already detailed; after ten years of misrule, Her Majesty's Government, notwithstanding its reluctance to extend the British dependencies on the African coast, was compelled, in the interests of humanity, to take possession of Lagos, and make it a British settlement.\n\nIf such were the consequences of this experiment in a place like Lagos, possessing so many conditions favourable to its success, it can hardly be doubted what would follow an attempt to apply it to places like the Gambia and the Gold Coast, surrounded by powerful and warlike natives, who are now only kept in restraint by the knowledge that we possess the power to enforce submission to our authority."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Extension of British Rule on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '“Dec. 9.—I hear to-day that the Government have arranged matters at Bagedah, and that a landing waiter has left for that place.

There must manifestly be great risk of injustice being perpetrated under the name and form of law, when only a part, instead of the whole, of the English system is introduced in a British settlement. The course pursued on the West Coast has been for the respective Legislative Councils (formed of Crown officials and other Government nominees) to pass ordinances from time to time, applying certain portions of the home laws to the settlements in which they might be exercising jurisdiction. In this way the British laws for the recovery of debts have been introduced in all the West Coast Settlements; and, as ought to have been considered a necessary consequence, the English laws for the relief of debtors have been subsequently introduced also, in all the colonies and settlements, excepting that of the River Gambia. This exception is the evil of which we complain, and which calls for prompt and immediate remedy. The English laws and form of procedure for the recovery of debt, and the old English laws of imprisonment for debt, are stringently applied at Bathurst; but there is no relief there for the insolvent debtor, as in England; the incarcerated debtor must remain in prison year after year, until death releases him, or his creditors relent and give him freedom. This partial application of English law is now producing results greatly to be deprecated. Under it, a gross and grinding and atrocious tyranny is exercised—a tyranny aggravated by the nature of the general mercantile transactions of the colony. The great trade of the River is that in ground-nuts. This trade is principally carried on by educated natives of Bathurst with the native producers in the upper part of the River. These educated natives, without whose intermediation between the British import houses and the native producers, the trade could not be carried on, are not possessed of the capital necessary to enable them to purchase imported goods of the importing merchants for purposes of barter, and subsequently to sell the ground-nuts to them. They have, therefore, to take the goods for barter from the merchants, at the merchants' prices, as agents, with the responsibility of principals. They are charged with the goods they take up the River for barter, at prices which may possibly enable them, in a very good ground-nut season, and barring accidents and plunder by marauding tribes (for there is no efficient British protection up the River), to cover their expenses and realise a small sum for the support of their families; but, practically, the result is, that the unfortunate trader is always in debt to the merchant—is hopelessly his slave—and, in the event of his desiring emancipation from this thraldom, or claiming for himself and his fellows equal protection and advantages with the merchant under British rule, he is proceeded against in the court of law for the balance alleged to be standing against him, has, almost as a matter of course, judgment pronounced against him, and from that moment becomes a hopeless and helpless victim of injustice under the name of law, to be locked up or allowed to be at large only at the will and caprice of his creditor. Now this is so repugnant to British law, to justice and equity—is so great a bar, so insuperable an obstacle to that native progress which the late committee of the House of Commons looked forward to for enabling the government to be carried on by the agency of educated natives in the West Coast Settlements—that, as we have before said, we feel that it is only necessary to bring it thus under the notice of Her Majesty’s Government to cause the adoption of some immediate measures by the Colonial-office for putting a stop to the grievous oppression under which the educated native traders in the River Gambia are now suffering. It would have been easy for us, and would have been our duty, had we not this conviction as regards the Colonial-office, to show how infamously the law has been of late set in action by one of the resident merchants for personal motives, hatreds, and interest, to the oppression of educated natives who have dared to aspire to an equality of rights, as British subjects, with the more opulent import and export merchants; but as it is always with the most extreme reluctance that we expose an offender, we abstain from any further remarks at present, and venture to express boldly the hope that it will be rendered altogether unnecessary, by his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies, or by Sir Arthur Kennedy, in his capacity of Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, ordering the immediate promulgation of an ordinance at the Gambia for putting in force there the English Bankrupt and Insolvency Laws, to be administered there as at Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, &c., with this proviso, that as trial by jury in civil causes is now abolished there, and by late alteration in the Jury Laws as regards criminal cases all the power of the jury-box is thrown into the hands of the few opulent mercantile houses, to the prejudice and danger of the whole body of educated natives, traders and others, no sentence of imprisonment under such Bankrupt and Insolvency Laws shall be at all carried into execution until the same has received the approval of the Governor-in Chief at Sierra Leone."", 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCRA, GOLD COAST COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Accra is now the capital of the Gold Coast Colony. Up till 1876 Cape Coast Castle enjoyed that honour, but in that year the head-quarters of the Government were moved to this place. The change would have been inadvisable on other than sanitary grounds, as there is not the least protection here against the surf which breaks along the shore, at some seasons rendering landing impracticable, and at all times dangerous. Once ashore, Accra presents pleasanter features and surroundings than are to be found in any of the other towns of the Gold Coast Colony. The town is much more scattered than that of Cape Coast Castle. It is built on the top of a red cliff, some 60 feet high, overlooking the sea. Formerly there were three Accras, British and Dutch, adjoining each other, which now form one town, and Danish two miles east. The latter still retains its Danish appellation, Christiansborg. British Accra is the oldest English possession on the West Coast, having been owned by us for upwards of two hundred years. The Danes do not seem to have left their mark on the place to any extent, either as regards language, manners, or customs, whereas the Dutch have left traces of their rule here in the number of half-castes with Dutch names, and also in the language spoken by the natives. Fantee is, of course, the language spoken by the natives, but it is a good deal corrupted by the addition of English and Dutch words. The language, to the ear unaccustomed to it, sounds uncouth and unmusical, and utterly devoid of that rhythm which Oriental languages possess, and which is so attractive to the untutored ear. The people here appear to be a similar race to the Ashantees. In fact, there is such constant intercourse going on between the Ashantee country and Accra that a large number of the inhabitants of this place are Ashantees. There are no troops here, merely a large force of Houssas, but their services are not much in request, as the people are very law-abiding. There is a considerable trade between Accra and the interior, and a large amount of gold dust is brought down and exported to England. The greatest care is requisite in purchasing this, and European merchants find it necessary to employ native assayers to prevent fraud on the part of the sellers. Some of the native jewellers here turn out fairly good workmanship in the shape of rings, necklaces, bracelets, &c.; they always manufacture from 22-carat gold, and their workmanship is consequently extremely soft. There are very few European merchants here—not more than three or four at present. Their number seems to have been diminishing of late years, and appears to be likely still further to decrease. The firms at home find that they can get their business out here equally well transacted by educated natives at less cost, so that the latter are gradually absorbing all the agencies for English houses. The white man cannot compete with the negro in his own country, when the latter is of average intelligence, fairly educated, and sufficiently cute; and from the progress made by the upper class of natives, it appears that the large firms in England will in a few years' time be glad to act as agents for the native merchants, instead of the latter transacting that office for them. A plentiful and constant supply of labour is the great difficulty this colony has to contend with—not that there is any lack of materials at hand, but the negro will not work as long as he can exist without it, and in a climate like this, existence becomes practicable on a very small amount of labour. The consequence is, that the adult male population of the Gold Coast Colony add little to the riches or produce of the country. Most of the work that is done is performed by the female portion of the community, while their husbands sit at ease and complacently view their wives and daughters labouring while they eat the bread of idleness. All the Europeans are agreed that the only hope for the future is a system of forced labour which, compelling able-bodied natives to work for fair remuneration, will take steps to guard this measure against the risk of abuse. In a very short period the increased wealth of the colony would demonstrate the benefits of such a measure, whilst the increased improvement in the condition of the natives would lead them to see that forced labour was advantageous to them and to the colony."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Governor Maxwell said he considered it a great advantage to meet those who could assist him in dealing with difficult questions, and to acquire some touch with the great centre of commerce with which the distant part of the globe he was to govern traded directly.

It, however, seemed curious that such an ordinance should be required, and he thought something should have been done long ago. It would be a mistake to grant tracts of land to speculators who had no intention of using them, or who were unable to do so. In the colonisation of Australia the Government there laid it down that concessions to settlers by Natives would not be sanctioned by the Government. The circumstances might be different in Africa, where there were princes with a recognised jurisdiction, but it would have been better if it was understood that concessions other than those granted by the Government would not be recognised. With regard to the mining industry he would make it one of his first duties to see how far the Government could go to aid in the development of these resources. But he had seen mines that were very promising, but which turned out to be very unproductive, and it would be necessary to see that these mines were not of this nature before it would be wise to construct a railway at considerable expense to the district in which they were situated. As to the rivalry of other countries, he thought they were agreed that if other countries allowed free trade it did not matter what the port was, but other countries did not grant free trade. Still, other countries had their aspirations, and they had a right to colonise on their own account and develop their own trade. But there were such things as hostile protective tariffs, and his efforts would be directed towards the means of attracting as much trade as possible by developing the roads, &c. With regard to Ashanti, he did not yet know how far it was possible to carry out the establishment of a British Protectorate there, but he was sure that if the Natives knew the advantages they would welcome the change. However, until he arrived at the Gold Coast and discussed these matters on the spot he was unable to say anything positive. He would do his best to make the district a prosperous one.

The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Somaliland > Local protest movements', 'content': ""distribution or grazing needs.

The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The one from Amanokurom, instead of saluting, cried at the Date man and said, ""You are a murderer; we have heard that you have killed somebody, and are now running away."" (A man had killed his wife in a town, Adukurom, in the same week, and ran away.) The other from Date answered, ""No, I am no murderer; I have been just working for a friend of mine, and afterwards have been looking for a few sticks to build a hut for me and my family, for we are now living in a farm not very far from hence; but I have lost my way, and as it is now getting dark, I am going to the village from whence you are coming to sleep there to-night, and return to-morrow morning to my family."" Says the other, ""I too am going to cut some palm branches to repair my roof, but I do not believe you; you are telling a lie."" With these words he gave him a cut on his head with his bush-knife. The Date man did the same, and so both of them wounded one another most fearfully. One of them had to be carried thence.\n\nIn the native court of the Chief of Aquapem the grandees found the matter very difficult to decide, as each, in relating his portion of the story, asserted that the other first began to fight him. They were then asked whether they knew each other before, and had ever had any quarrel together? But they never had met before. Now the whole court was in perplexity. There were no witnesses, and each accused the other. A part of the court said, ""Let us count the wounds, and see who has most."" The other part said, ""No, that can\'t give any decision."" But the King decided the case in a very clever manner. He said: ""I have seen that each one\'s matter is as sweet as honey [according to the country expression], but none of us were there, and you cannot produce any witness. You all know that we are under the protection of the English Government, and I, being the king of this country, am responsible for all that is done against the English laws. You know that some years ago a subject of mine murdered an Accraman, and hid him in the bush, and the Accras said I myself had killed him. Had the murderer not been found out, the English Government would have punished me. Now suppose you two had wounded one another in the bush in such a way that both had died on the spot, who had to give account before the English court but myself? Therefore this folly which you two have committed has been done against me and my good name before the English Government.

(See African Times, November No., Memorial to this Colonial-office.)\n\nIn 1859, Harry Finden, with others, called on Governor D\'Arcy for the first time. Governor D\'Arcy had passed a wrong judgment upon a British subject, by delivering him over into the hands of his accusers, from under the protection of the British Government, without a shred of evidence to prove the charge of theft laid against him; and which led to his being, according to heathen law, _murdered by the King of Farraba._ (See African Times, April No., 1865.) Finden\'s argument on this subject with the Governor was, that he could not understand how a British subject could be delivered over into the hand of a native chief, to be judged by heathen laws, while there were sufficient British judges at Bathurst. The King of Farraba having a charge against the man, ought to have sent the accusers and evidence to Bathurst, and the case should have been tried by a judge and jury, to the satisfaction of all. But his Excellency gave over the man as a favour, &c., to the King of Farraba; but favour should have been out of the question where the life of a human being, and that human being a British subject, was at stake. Governor D\'Arcy, on finding his error, hurried a messenger to the King of Farraba to return his prisoner; but the answer from the King was, ""_Trop tard, trop tard, j\'ai déjà placé lui dans mon jardin_ (too late, too late, I have already put him into my garden).""

So far as Sappor and the other parties who owned some of the cattle were concerned, this piece of paper was entirely worthless. For example: I rob my neighbour of his horse; I bring it to you, and offer to hand it over to you in payment of an account you have against me; you know that I stole the horse, and thinking to secure yourself and prevent the possibility of the owner claiming it from you, you get a document from me wherein I notify to all whom it may concern that I gave the horse to you in payment of a certain debt. Would this, I ask, bar the owner from claiming his horse, and would it secure you in the possession of it in the eyes of the law? I am inclined to think that in England the receiver, under such circumstances, would be only too glad to get rid of his bargain and be let alone, if the law would leave him alone after such inexplicable conduct. The seizure of the cattle took place on the 29th April at Addah, and the document in question was drawn up in Accra and dated two weeks after; and moreover, Abloh was not in Addah, but one hundred miles off, in Kroboe, when the cattle were panyarred. The Court attached no weight to the fact that Hillgenburg admitted that he was aware some of the cattle belonged to other parties, and that he had promised to deliver them to their respective owners on reaching Accra. It was not denied that Abloh had paid over to Ungar the property of others in satisfaction of his own liabilities, but it was ruled that those parties should have sued Abloh, and not Ungar. In fact, it was the application of pure country law in a British court of justice—the virtual acknowledgment of the right of panyarring. After the conclusion of the evidence for the defence, on the 29th May, the Court adjourned to the 31st, in order, so it was stated, to allow the members an opportunity of reading over the evidence and deliberating upon the judgment to be delivered.\n\nOn the 31st, at eleven A.M., Captain Crozier alone appeared on the bench. Seeing the defendant in court, he said to him, ""Oh, Mr. Ungar, the case is decided in your favour; you may go!"" Not a single word more was uttered. Astonishment was depicted on the countenances of every one present, save and except the defendant, who from the very moment he entered the court had appeared in unusually good spirits. The plaintiff\'s attorney, of course, at once gave notice of an appeal to the Chief Magistrate\'s Court; but in all probability nothing more will ever be heard of the matter, as Ungar will be leaving the Coast, most probably never to return, before the next official visit of Mr. Parker, the Chief Magistrate, to this place.'}, {'id': 1566, 'article_title': ""MR.

But I think it best to dispose of it as far as possible in the stage which it has reached, without taking notice of any past irregularity.\n\nTwo legal points appear to me to be brought under my consideration.\n\nFirstly, The Imperial Act 24 and 25 Vic. c. 96 is among others adopted in Sierra Leone by the Local Ordinance No. 3 of 1862, ""so far as local circumstances will permit;"" and the 116th section of that Act provides the form of indictment for a subsequent offence after a previous conviction for felony or misdemeanor, in which form of indictment the previous conviction is specifically alleged.\n\nIt is stated that Mr. Huggins sentenced prisoners to the increased punishment due to a subsequent conviction on being satisfied of the previous convictions, (d) although such convictions were not stated in the informations according to the form provided by Act of Parliament.\n\nMr. Huggins explains that it is for the judge to decide what parts of an act thus adopted in a colony are really in force in them; he adduces what certainly appear to be very good reasons for thinking that this section of the Imperial Act is not applicable to the circumstances of Sierra Leone; and he has therefore treated it as not being in force. He adds that former judges have not thought it indispensable that prior convictions should be thus stated in criminal informations. (e)\n\nSecondly, it is alleged that in certain instances Mr. Huggins has sentenced certain persons to greater punishments than the law admitted of.\n\nTo this Mr. Huggins replies by referring to the Act 7 and 8, Geo. IV., c. 28, sec. 11, which is in force in the Colony, and which I may observe is not referred to by the petition. (f)\n\nThe first point raised by the petitioners is one of form, that is to say it is not denied that the prisoners were really liable to the punishment inflicted on them if only the proper forms had been observed. (g)\n\nI think it very unadvisable that the Queen\'s prerogative of mercy should be used for the purpose of defeating substantial justice; and without expressing any opinions as to the correctness or incorrectness of Mr. Huggins\'s judgment, I consider that the Executive Government should treat it as authoritative unless and until a contrary decision should be pronounced by some superior court.'}, {'id': 1605, 'article_title': 'Equities of Cape Coast Government', 'full_section_title': 'Equities of Cape Coast Government', 'last_edit_date': '08-23-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1869#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_08_1869', 'content': ""I was a passenger per steamship Congo, from Sierra Leone, and on my arrival here I found on board two small boxes addressed to me, and not knowing anything about them, I gave them in charge of the landing waiter on board the ship, in presence of more than half a dozen witnesses.

He has but to leave Bathurst, and the authorities will not follow him, on the score of the expense. Here is a case in point. Some years ago, a captain of a small vessel broached goods belonging to the charterer, took them on shore at the port of Albreda, and there sold them; and, as he was landing at night, met and conversed with the policeman on duty, and said he was going to sell some goods in the town. One of the crew afterwards revealed the matter, and a warrant was applied for against the captain. On the night of the day the warrant was issued, the man got notice of it, and escaped into Combo; when the police looked for him next day, he was gone. The owner of the goods then had to issue a reward for his apprehension, and insisted on the police following him through Combo, which they did; but he again got wind, and escaped out of British jurisdiction. The owner of the goods went to Albreda to investigate the case, and heard from the policeman that he saw the man take the goods on shore to sell them. Nearly a year passed over, when the owner heard that the man was in British Burra, and insisted on his arrest. At last he was caught and brought down, when it turned out that a Mandingo detective had to be employed to catch him. The case came before the Police-court. The policeman from Albreda was there, and swore that he never saw the man take the goods on shore, but that the man came to him and took him on board the cutter, and showed him how the packages of goods had been tampered with by the crew. This was evidently to screen the captain, as the crew, who were the witnesses of the case, could not be found after that lapse of time. There was not enough evidence for committal, so the man was let out. At the end of the case the Sergeant-Major of the Police stood up and told the magistrate the man must have been innocent, as when he heard there was a warrant out for his arrest _he gave himself up_.\n\nThis, of course, was not the case, or why did the man hide in different parts of the country for a year? and why was his mother constantly begging the owner of the goods to withdraw the warrant? and then, after the case was dismissed, why did the Sergeant in charge of the Court bring the Mandingo detective to the owner of the goods, and claim and get paid the reward? But then the prisoner was a friend, or relation, I do not know which, of the Sergeant-Major.'}, {'id': 4376, 'article_title': 'SEEMINGLY UNJUST AND IMPOLITIC SENTENCE.', 'full_section_title': 'SEEMINGLY UNJUST AND IMPOLITIC SENTENCE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1882#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_02_1882', 'content': 'Some month or two ago it was said that a Salaga man was tried in the Supreme Court, apparently for slave-dealing: but at any rate he was sentenced to four years\' imprisonment. The circumstances (if as stated) were these: The Salaga man came here to trade and brought his wife and child with him. A Houssa, taking a fancy for the woman, accused the stranger of being a slave dealer. Even if the woman had been the man\'s slave, how could the mere possession of a slave make him open to punishment? When here, Governor Strachan and Judge Chalmers issued a decree that anyone who chose to remain with his master could do so. Where then is this poor man\'s crime? He did not buy a slave here. According to the gentlemen just named, a man may keep his slave as long as the slave voluntarily remains with him: The woman was asked if she were the man\'s slave, and she answered that he bought her and married her. The man explained that that was the custom of his country. The Houssa in search of a wife was put into the witness-box. What evidence could he give of facts of his own knowledge? This poor man had broken no British Gold Coast law within British jurisdiction, and the most the Court could have had any right to do was to emancipate the woman if she desired it. The English law acknowledges a marriage lawful wherever contracted, if according to the customs of that country, even between an Englishman and a native of any other country. If the mere bringing a slave here subjects a man to four years\' imprisonment, who did not know that the bulk of the 400 men brought by the Ashantee ""Prince,"" ambassador, and the rest of it were slaves? So far from imprisoning him, the fuss that was made about him must have much astonished him. I have called the man a Salagan, but it seems he said he was from a country as far beyond Salaga as Salaga is from Accra, and that having heard of Accra he came with his wife to see the place and to buy goods.

The older custom was to send out picked men to be the local military and political chiefs, and in their hands was left the execution of measures deemed desirable or necessary. The new departure is to send out these picked men as heretofore, and allow them to become fully acquainted with local affairs, but whenever troubles come to a head to despatch from England special men to do the special work. It is thus that we have recently had Stellaland—originally intrusted to the control of the High Commissioner and the administration of his deputy—now handed over to the military rule of a major-general, specially sent out as Special Commissioner, with an army of several thousand men; while his superior officer, a lieutenant-general, full of local experience of the whole country, remains in Cape Town merely ""watching events."" Nor have people forgotten the disastrous effects in Zululand, when, after years of protest and request on the part of the local authorities, Lord Wolseley is suddenly sent out specially to arrange all things. The condition to which Zululand is now reduced is palpable evidence of the inadequacy of this new régime to meet the needs of the case. In Bechuanaland, shortly after the arrival of the Special Commissioner, the Administrator feels himself called upon in honour to resign, and the rock of offence was the arrest of Niekerk. The case is one of far-reaching import. Niekerk is arrested on a charge of murder, and many hold that if he is condemned to death there will be a flame lighted of rare animosity, the quenching of which will exceed any trouble South Africa has yet seen. It may be well to give the story of the case in brief. Niekerk is a Dutchman who was the constituted head of the Stellaland Republic. In that capacity he issued a proclamation declaring one Honey to be an outlaw, and forbidding him to re-enter Stellaland. Among the alleged crimes were treason and cattle-lifting. Honey braved the proclamation and re-entered Stellaland. He was captured and taken to the neighbouring Transvaal for trial. The authorities there declined, on the plea of ultra vires. The prisoner was taken away, and barbarously shot en route by order of the Administration of Stellaland. This all occurred in the beginning of 1883, more than a year before the Queen\'s protectorate was declared over the country. Moreover, the facts are well known to Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Rhodes, who administered the country in the Queen\'s name. Both employed and worked with Niekerk. The trial will, no doubt, clear up the case; but at present many are puzzled to know how the constituted head of a State can be brought to trial in another State for giving orders in verbal accordance with legal proclamation. At all events, this case has had a tendency to arouse rare animosities, although the vigorous action of Sir C. Warren has undoubtedly reassured a large section of the population who are sadly in need of reassurance. It is now commonly accepted ""that England is in earnest, and determined to put a stop to the lawless state of affairs in Bechuanaland, and show she means to be supreme in South Africa."" This trial and this breach with the Administration are delaying Sir C. Warren in Stellaland; but it is reported that the freebooters of the Goshen Republic have judiciously retired over the Transvaal border. They declined to recognize the deputy commissioners sent up from here, but with no force at their backs; and expressed the conviction that no English soldier would come north of the Orange River. But now they are undeceived; the soldiers have come in large numbers; and the General in command has adopted so vigorous a line of action as to secure respect for English authority. All are hoping for a peaceful solution; all are anxiously awaiting the specific declaration of what is to be done. The Cape Government is ready to assist with money the institution of some permanent English administration, but the Home Government must explain their intentions fully, and show that the scheme has the merit of permanency.'}, {'id': 5850, 'article_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.', 'full_section_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_06_1889#article-6', 'issue_date': '03_06_1889', 'content': 'HOUSE OF COMMONS.—May 1.**\n\n**MURDER OF MR.

Five white farmers were charged with tying up natives and cruelly flogging them. Two of the natives were so badly injured that they had to be removed to hospital, and one of them died of blood poisoning resulting from his wounds. The defendants were indicted for culpable homicide in the one case, and assault in respect of the others; and the Solicitor-General, who prosecuted for the Crown, described the narrative as exhibiting ""a monotony of brutality.""\n\nFor the defence it was alleged that nothing more than a ""common assault"" had been committed, and only by one of the farmers, Mr. J. P. T. Hart. Mr. Hart himself gave evidence, in which he said that he had only used a ""reim,"" not a ""sjambok,"" in flogging the natives, who had been killing valuable sheep belonging to him. His anger at his losses had something to do with the severity of the punishment. The jury found the defendants guilty of ""common assault under great provocation,"" but acquitted them altogether on the other indictment.\n\nMr. Justice Jones, while admitting that there was some reason for the merciful view taken by the jury regarding the former charge, characterised the verdict of acquittal on the charge of homicide as ""a disgrace to the community."" For the assault, Hart was fined £125 or fifteen months\' imprisonment, and the other sentences varied from £45 to £100.\n\nThe Judge\'s comments are strongly endorsed by a portion of the colonial Press, and resented by another section. The *Cape Times* says the jury decided that killing was no murder. The effect of the trial on the native mind cannot fail to be mischievous and disquieting. They ""will see that they are liable to punishment without law, without proof of guilt, without fair inquiry of any sort, and that against such violence they are practically left without protection. The only remedy seems to be abandonment of trial by jury, and the establishment of a special Court, as on the diamond fields, or the adjudication of cases subject to the influence of racial prejudice."" The *Eastern Province Herald*, while agreeing that men must not take the law into their own hands, calls upon the Government to suppress the crime which led to the present case. ""Here is an owner of valuable stock losing them day by day, his own herds being in the conspiracy to rob him. He obtains from one of the boys a confession implicating several others, and he finds the skins of slaughtered sheep in the bush. He finds that sheep worth £30 apiece have been slaughtered for a beer-drink, and yet he can get no evidence which will hold water in a Court of law.

The letter was suggested by certain incidents which have recently arisen in the administration of the Lagos Folded Woven Goods Ordinance. These principles are—(1) That seeing the ultimate consumers of cotton goods are illiterate and measure the goods after their own fashion irrespective of any mark or number on the piece, all that is really necessary is that goods shall be folded in 36in. folds. (2) If the marking of a length be insisted upon, it is unnecessary to have it marked both on a ticket and stamped on the piece itself. The last course is to be preferred. (3) Lenient administration is necessary, especially in the early stages of the operation of the law. (4) The maximum fines should not be too high, as under the Lagos Ordinance, seeing that they have relation to offences which might easily arise through inadvertence.

Renner, was called to the English Bar by the Honourable Society of Lincoln\'s Inn in April 1883, and in 1884 he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast Colony. The circumstances which led to the proceedings in which this appeal is taken occurred in or about Sept. 1886, and Feb. 1887. During the first of these periods the appellant was employed by one J. W. Sackey to prepare on his behalf a mortgage of a dwelling-house and land in Elmina belonging to him in favour of a native chief Eccra Kwaku. Special instructions were given that the consideration to be inserted was the sum of £250 advanced to him on or before the date of the deed, and also that the deed was to be antedated, Sept. 26, 1884. The appellant prepared the deed in accordance with these instructions, and sent it to his client; but he was not present at and took no part in its execution and its delivery to the mortgagee. There is no evidence as to the precise date upon which the mortgage deed prepared by the appellant was delivered by him to Sackey; but its delivery and its execution must both have been subsequent to Sept. 20, 1886. It now appears that at the time when instructions were given for the preparation of the mortgage one John F. Brooks had obtained a judgment against Sackey for the sum of £921 8s., payable by instalments of £250 per quarter, the first instalment on Dec. 20, 1886. The judgment creditor became entitled to recover that debt by attachment and sale of the debtor\'s property, real or personal. Mr. Brooks did not take any steps to levy his debt from the property included in this mortgage until Jan. 1887. After that fact came to his knowledge Eccra Kwaku, on Jan. 29, 1887, instituted an interpleader suit, with the object of having the property mortgaged to him released from the attachment; and in that proceeding the appellant acted as his solicitor. The case went to trial before Chief Justice MacLeod, when the mortgagee gave evidence in his own favour, being examined by the appellant as his counsel and solicitor. In answer to questions, he stated the consideration which had been given to him for the mortgage, and also stated, ""I have the mortgage, and produce it, marked A, dated Sept. 26, 1884. After production of the document, which bore the date assigned to it, no questions were put to the witness as to the actual date of its execution; but he was fully cross-examined as to the consideration given for the deed. The learned Judge, on considering the evidence, released the mortgage property. Eccra Kwaku, the mortgagee, died in 1890; and nothing more was heard of this matter until upwards of seven years after. In April 1894, Kwasie Mensah, administrator of the deceased, brought an action against F. H. Kwaku, one of the sons of the deceased, for certain sums alleged to be due by him to the estate, in which the appellant acted as counsel and solicitor for the plaintiff. On July 27, 1894, Mr. Roberts, acting as counsel and solicitor for the defendant, moved for a rule nisi calling upon the appellant to show cause why he should not be suspended for a specified period from practising within the jurisdiction of the Court, pending the confirmation or disallowance of such suspension by the full Court: or why the matters charged against him should not be referred to the full Court in order that his name might be struck off the roll of the Court. The suit was, at that time, before Mr. Justice Redwar; and the application was made in terms of Section 79 of the Supreme Court Ordinance, 1876, which gave the learned Judge the power of temporary suspension with the alternative of remitting the matter to the consideration and determination of the full bench. On Aug. 31, 1894, Mr. Justice Redwar, being of opinion that the charges against the appellant were of too grave a character to be dealt with by him, discharged the rule which he had granted, and referred the whole matter to the full Court. On Sept. 12, 1894, Mr. Roberts appeared before the full Court, consisting of Chief Justice Hutchinson and Mr. Justice Redwar, and formulated the charges he had preferred against the appellant—(1) ""That Renner, about Oct. 1886, drew a mortgage for J. W. Sackey, and, with intent to defraud, dated it Sept. 26, 1884; and also, with the same intent, inserted the sum of £250 instead of £150""; (2) ""that at the hearing of an interpleader summons at Cape Coast, before MacLeod, C. J., Renner put the mortgage in evidence and did not inform the Court that the date of it was false, and in the result the Court, on the ground that the date 1884 was the true date, gave judgment against the judgment creditor on that summons."" On the same occasion Mr. Roberts explained these charges, and read a number of affidavits which had been produced by himself and by the appellant. The matter came again before the full Bench on Sept. 20, 1894, when the appellant examined several witnesses and addressed the Court in his own behalf. On the same day the learned Judges, having considered the affidavits and other evidence submitted to them, delivered their judgment in the matter. They held that the first charge was not, and that the second charge was proved; and in respect of the latter they ordered the name of the appellant to be struck off the roll of the Court. With reference to the second charge, the learned Judges, after quoting the evidence given by Eccra Kwaku, in the interpleader suit, observed, ""The judge believed the statement of Eccra Kwaku, and gave judgment in his favour. Mr. Renner, at the time this statement was made, knew that it was false, because he had himself drawn the deed some time after Sept. 1886, and it is impossible that he should have forgotten it; and he knew that the statement must of necessity influence the result. If Mr. Renner had informed the Court that the statement made by his client was false, the Judge would, as a matter of course, have disbelieved the whole of the man\'s evidence; and, unless the rest of his evidence were corroborated by other testimony, would not have believed that he had lent any money at all to the judgment debtor, and would therefore have disallowed the claim. We are satisfied that Mr. Renner was a party to the deception practised upon the court."" Their Lordships cannot avoid noticing the intimate connexion which exists between the two charges which were before the Court. The first accuses the appellant of having antedated the mortgage with intent to defraud some one, it is not said whom. But it is impossible to peruse the affidavits and other documents laid before the Court without seeing that the object imputed to the appellant was to enable Sackey to defeat the just claims of Brooks, his judgment creditor, by creating a fictitious incumbrance upon his real estate, which might otherwise have been taken in execution and made available for payment of his debt. The judgment debt did not, of itself, constitute a charge upon the debtor\'s real estate; and the mortgage in question, if it represented a real transaction, would have been equally effective to exclude the judgment creditor if it had been dated in October 1886, seeing that no attachment followed upon the judgment debt until January 1887. There is no proof that the appellant knew, or had any reason to believe, that the mortgagee had not advanced the consideration which the deed bears, at or before the date which he was instructed by Mr. Sackey to insert. Sackey was examined in the interpleader suit of 1887, when he swore that the mortgagee had advanced £250 in Sept. 1894. It is true that in the action of 1894 Sackey denied he had instructed the appellant to insert the £250 in the mortgage; but their Lordships can attach no credit to that statement, which is inconsistent with his letter dated Sept. 29, 1886, as well as with the fact that he accepted the mortgage deed as drawn in conformity with his instructions, and then proceeded to execute and deliver it to Eccra Kwaku, the mortgagee. Their Lordships also think it necessary to observe that in the suit of 1894 the evidence taken before Mr. Justice Redwar establishes that in the year 1884 sums amounting to £150 and bearing interest at 50 per cent. were advanced to Sackey by Eccra Kwaku, the only dispute being whether the money so advanced belonged to the deceased chief or came from his son, the plaintiff in the suit. There must, therefore, have been ample consideration to support the mortgage, and Brook\'s claim in the interpleader could not have been legally sustained, whatever might have been the amount recoverable by the mortgagee in a redemption suit by the mortgagor or his creditors. The sting of the second charge appears to their Lordships to consist in this—that the appellant, having previously aided Mr. Sackey to defeat his creditor by the preparation of a fraudulent mortgage, then proceeded to accomplish that scheme by misleading the Court as to the true character of the mortgage. The finding of the Court with respect to the first charge, of which their Lordships entirely approve, completely alters the aspect of the second. In the view which, according to that finding, the appellant took of the character of the mortgage, the actual date of the deed became of comparatively little importance. The material question was whether it represented a genuine transaction, and upon that point the appellant had no reason to doubt his own client. His client, Eccra Kwaku was examined by the counsel for the judgment creditor as to the consideration given by him for the mortgage, and it does not appear that...\n**[JAN. 4, 1897.]**'}, {'id': 6849, 'article_title': 'TRIAL OF DR.

The charges against Dr. Peters have formed the subject of repeated interpellations in the Diet, leading to debates of which the present investigation and trial may be regarded as the result. These charges are resumed in the indictment as follows: 1. (a) That in October 1891 Dr. Peters arbitrarily caused a Native youth, and in January 1892, a Native girl to be hanged at Kilima-Njaro. (b) That in October or November of the same year he unjustifiably brought about warlike troubles with the Chief Malamia. (c) That at the same period he arbitrarily sentenced three Native girls to receive barbarous corporal chastisement. 2. That on various occasions he sent reports which were false in several particulars to his official superiors. 3. That in 1892 and subsequently he admitted that he had hanged a Native youth for having had relations with the concubine of Dr. Peters or of one of his officers—and that by these proceedings he had made himself guilty of an abuse of the powers of his office, and of a gross violation of its duties, and, in fact, had shown himself unworthy of the reputation attaching to his office.'}]","[{'document_title': 'BATHURST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—Owing to the great abuses reported repeatedly by ""The Gambian,"" and the gross injustice that has prevailed in the Gambia courts, one Mr. Reffie has been sent over to England by the black inhabitants of the River Gambia to study law, in order that he may be in some degree qualified to defend his fellow-countrymen from the injustice to which they are from time to time compelled to submit in the court of that colony.\n\nThe weight of the one branch of the Gambia law is equal to a waggon burden; but we shall still despair of obtaining justice if merchants and their clerks are to continue to be the magistrates and commissioners in their courts. What will the plea of a defendant avail, where the plaintiff sits on the bench as commissioner? How, and in what way, can a prisoner expect justice, where he is to be tried by the complainant? How, then, can justice be pursued in such court, where the plaintiffs and complainants, or their clerks, are to sit on the bench as magistrates and commissioners, to decide upon their own suits or charges? Here are three among the many great obstacles which stand in the way of justice in the Gambia court, and unless they be removed, things will never get on well in the colony, as you and Christian England would wish. I have twice had to appease attempts of mutiny in the said court, all from the same complaint of injustice.\n\nThe Gambia Court requires a paid magistrate, one who is independent of both black and white, but who will seek the interest of his employer, and the welfare of Her Majesty\'s colony. To secure justice, England must do away with the merchants and their clerks in the court, as they are not seeking the interest of the colony, but their own. And if this be continued, it will ultimately end with disgrace, and the downfall of a long-standing British colony. What will foreign nations think, when they hear and see that even in a British colony the African subjects are not entirely freed, being in bondage under injustice and partiality?\n\nI am much pleased with the decision of the honourable Committee, placing the Gambia again under the Sierra Leone Government, as was the case formerly, when there was no such complaint as now. But there is something yet required to be done, which I suggest will make great improvement in this small colony—that is, to reduce some of the large expenditure of the several departments. For instance, say the Secretary\'s department for one; five offices (including the Collector of Custom\'s branch) and the hire of the building cost 2,080l. a year (not including the subordinates). Really, you will agree with me that it is rather exorbitant for the part keeping up of only one department per annum in so small a colony as the Gambia; and more so, as the five officers are not all Europeans, who have received a sound English education, but mere boys, who even have not completed their African schooling.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Conciliate Natives, Etc., in a New Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## HOW TO CONCILIATE NATIVES, ETC., IN A NEW COLONY.\n\nThe following is an abridged account of _an affair_ that came off lately at Lagos. Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued. Few days after, hearing at the police-station. Decision—""The Europeans to pay for the summons, 3s.""\n\nOur correspondent says: ""This is a British colony. Is that English justice? Is that the way the white people mean continually to treat us, to make us respect, fear, and honour them?"" He adds: ""If a black man had committed a similar offence, he would most likely have got one or two years\' imprisonment."" And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_. We believe so too. For this reason, among others, we insert his complaint. We cannot afford to have the game of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast played over again at Lagos. We know the chief authority will see this in our columns; and we hope to hear that, if justice has not been duly administered, the error will be rectified.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone.

I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous.

This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

On the northern side of the river, although we have long been the nominal possessors of a considerable portion of the Barra country, we have never ventured to exercise over it the slightest jurisdiction, and it has now been largely built on by the Marabouts, fanatics with whom it would be impossible to interfere; all thought of obtaining any influence over a country which they inhabit must therefore be abandoned. There is, however, one Sonninkee town, Essow, situated within the ceded mile of Barra, and just opposite St. Mary's Island, which, at the intercession of Governor d'Arcy, was spared by Maba when he burnt all the Pagan towns in the neighbourhood. Conscious of their weakness, the chiefs and people have expressed to the Governor a desire to live under British rule, the simplest mode of effecting which would be by the cession of their country, but this is impracticable, from the fact that they are shareholders. There are also strong objections to their country being made a protectorate, in the sense in which this word is understood in England. It would, however, be a subject of much regret if this small, harmless, and useful community should thus be abandoned to destruction through the fear of our becoming involved in unnecessary responsibilities, and it is to be hoped that the local Government may, without risk to itself, find some means of extending to them the protection they seek. Such a step would further our obtaining that influence on the northern side of the river of which, as has been stated, we are reaping the benefits on the south.\n\nThe natives not being British subjects, with the exception of the few residing permanently in the colony, are not, of course, liable to direct taxation, but the principal part of the revenue being derived from an export duty on ground-nuts, the produce of their labour, they do contribute largely, though indirectly, their share of taxation.\n\nThe export of slaves has been unknown at the Gambia for many years.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule.

An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony.

Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': ""The first generation had coped with the problems of creating a viable new society from scratch. Between 1816 and 1823 the impetus came from the Governor, Sir Charles MacCarthy, an administrator and builder with the soul of a missionary. The continual growth of the population, and its eagerness to put down roots, made improvement of the amenities impera› tive. As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade. The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed. Though religious syncretism was not achieved, at any rate Christianity, traditional African religions and Islam co-existed at close quarters."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Niger delta > The eastern delta', 'content': ""The decision to abolish the slave trade by Britain in 1807 was an important factor for change. Efforts to effect stoppage of the trade led to new activities by British traders, consuls, and naval officers, resulting in new relationships with the delta states.

For example, in 1827 a naval squadron was stationed at Fernando Po, and in 1849,$^{ tne}$ & $^{TSt}$ British consul, John Beecroft, was appointed for the entire territories of the Bights of Benin and Bonny.

For the delta states, these developments meant the demonstration of British power in their waters, bringing the era of gunboat diplomacy in which the British consuls used naval power to negotiate favourable conditions for British traders, missionaries, and explorers. In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

It is interesting to note that the action of the asafo was precipi› tated by the decision of the Akyem Abuakwa State Council to approve the Native Administration Revenue measure proposed by the Colonial administration which was to give the council power to impose a levy on its subjects. As Simensen has shown, the list of charges preferred against the Omanhene show 'an increased awareness of the commoners that many of their troubles arose from the fact that the chiefs were being integrated into the administrative structure of the Colonial Government, and thereby removed from popular control'.$^{20}$ Thus the action of the asafo was directed as much against the colonial administration as it was against the traditional rulers. It is significant that it was only the timely intervention of the colonial rulers that saved Ofori Atta himself, though he conceded some of the demands by, for instance, admitting three members of the Akyem Abuakwa Scholars Union to the State Council in 1933.\nThe other method that the rural folk adopted was the use of cocoa hold› ups.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

It is associated with the names of Canning, Wilberforce, and Brougham; and Zachary Macaulay—father of the brilliant historian and mighty Whig—devoted his best exertions for its improvement and social advancement. It originally belonged to a company, and its first governor was General Perronet Thompson, the honest and unflinching Reformer. At this time it was called ""The White Man\'s Grave,"" from the insalubrity of the climate; and its revenues, in consequence of the fatal slave-trade, did not amount to more than 5,000l. per annum. The climate now ranks equally well with any of our West Indian settlements, and the revenue amounts to 100,000l. per annum. For the last four years considerable discontent has existed in the colony—a Whig Government having deprived the colonists of trial by jury in all civil actions. This step was not taken in consequence of any abuse of the great constitutional right upon the part of African jurors; but it was alleged that the power wielded by a coloured advocate of no ordinary pretensions created an undue spirit for litigation amongst the natives. Mr. Pope Hennessey, brought up in a constitutional school, no doubt will bring his senatorial experience to bear upon the subject. The colony boasts of a Legislative Council, twelve in number, principally composed of Government officials, and the Governor presides at their assemblies, where they pass laws which come under the designation of ""Ordinances."" No African has a seat at this council-board; and although the natives possess vast wealth (the whole retail trade of the colony being in their hands), the commission of the peace has not been given to any of them. Mr. Butt\'s ""Home Rule"" is at every considerable discount in this colony, but fortunately the negro is of a more passive nature than is the fiery Celt. The house and land-tax falls very heavily upon the natives, who complain that the money thus acquired is spent in idle pageant, whilst the education grant does not amount to 100l. per annum. Steps are just now being taken to establish savings banks in Freetown, in order to check the reckless and extravagant habits of the people, as well as to reclaim the waste land around, which is the prolific cause of malaria. Mr. Pope Hennessey, it will thus be seen, has a noble mission before him, and under his intellectual and benignant rule Africa may yet fulfil the splendid prophecy of Canning as to her certain, though comparatively tardy, civilisation.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LATEST FROM SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""From Freetown, Sierra Leone, we learn that the rainy season has now fairly set in, and commercial affairs are at a standstill. In local politics there is great activity, the Legislative Council being in full session. This has caused great excitement among the inhabitants. It appears that by order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies an Ordinance is to be passed giving the town a Municipality. Besides this, the Estimates for 1891 are about to be passed, a larger revenue is required, and a new tariff will probably be promulgated, which will come in force in January.\n\nThe Municipality Ordinance is strongly opposed in its present shape by all the inhabitants. It is considered merely a device to re-impose the house and land tax, repealed since 1872. A Commission has been nominated, consisting of the Queen's Advocate, the Colonial Treasurer, Mr. Samuel Lewis, and Mr. T. J. Sawyer, the two latter unofficial members of the Legislative Council, to frame an amended Ordinance, containing more liberal provisions, especially with reference to the powers to be given to the town councillors. This Colony has been a Crown Colony over a hundred years, and the people think it time they should be allowed some voice in the expenditure of the revenue. They say the Municipality must be on such lines as will make it a reality, for as the draft stands it merely appears to create a Government Department, in which the Governor and his nominees are supreme. A well-digested scheme would probably not be opposed, for it would only be a tentative measure, until finally the Colony would become self-governing.\n\nThe Estimates for 1890 have been well maintained, and a fair surplus will be available at the end of the year. But a larger revenue is required for carrying on the frontier policy. More money is also wanted for education, public roads, bridges, and buildings, a subsidy for steam communication between Freetown and other parts of the Colony for the conveyance of fruits, and other objects now neglected for want of funds. Especially, money is required to be spent in Sherbro' to build Government offices at Bradoo, which is the most healthy part of Sherbro'. The new Customs tariff must be better adapted than the old one to the position the Colony holds as regards trade with the surrounding countries. The fiscal laws in the French territories are on a different basis. No import duty is charged by them; only an export duty of 7½ per cent. on all produce. In consequence, all trade goes in preference to their part of the coast, while the British stations are neglected. It is hoped that the new tariff will be such that it will not press too heavily on any one article, so that the British merchants can compete with the French for the trade from the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The humble petition of the undersigned humbly showeth:—  \n1. That your petitioners are inhabitants of the Settlement of Sierra Leone on the West Coast of Africa, and having during the past two or three years regarded with sadness the increasing depression of trade which is the mainstay of the Colonial Revenue, now humbly ask leave to lay before your lordship the straitened condition of the Settlement, with a suggestion of what appears to your lordship's petitioners to be a remedy for the evils of which they complain.  \n2. That although, according to the present Charter of Constitution, Sierra Leone theoretically embraces all Her Majesty's possessions comprised between the fifth and twelfth degrees of north latitude, and lying to the westward of the tenth degree of west longitude, it, in point of fact, includes only the peninsula of Sierra Leone which is about eighteen miles long and twelve miles broad and the district of Sherbro acquired by cession in the year 1862.  \n3. That whatever may be conjectured of the agricultural aptness of Sierra Leone, it cannot be gainsaid that the special capabilities of the Settlement have betrayed themselves strongly in favour of trade; and that its capacity for rapid development as a commercial community is evidenced by the fact that whereas in 1864 the imports amounted to 190,441l., the exports 201,808l., and the revenue, collected chiefly upon merchandise, 48,692l.; in 1871 the imports increased to 305,849l., the exports 467,755l., and the revenue 80,406l.  \n4. That a small proportion only of the imports of the Settlement is consumed within it; and that the greater bulk is carried into the interior countries by the adjacent native tribes who until lately have from the countries lying along the Melicourie and Scarcies Rivers on the north, and between Calmont Creek and the Bargroo River on the south, numerously resorted to the Settlement and made there large sales and purchases.  \n5. That the amount of trade, until lately, carried on within Sierra Leone itself by the adjacent native tribes occupying the place of intermediaries between the Settlement and the interior countries, was so considerable as to afford not only an ample field for the commercial operations of the general community of merchants and traders, but also a sensible support to the colonial revenue.  \n6. That your lordship's petitioners sincerely believe that the acquisition of, at least, the seaboard of those adjacent native territories at the proper time would have secured the Sierra Leone trade and revenue from the fluctuation and peril to which both seem at the present time to be exposed. That with the perception of the advantages that would have been so secured, recommendations had been made about eleven years ago to the then Governor of Sierra Leone by an influential body of the inhabitants of the Settlement, to accept a cession of some of the territories in Melicourie which were then offered by the native Princes to, but refused by, the Sierra Leone Government.  \n7. That this refusal to accept the cession was shortly followed by the French taking possession of those territories, which with others had become so important to the general welfare of Sierra Leone, that Sir Arthur Kennedy during his Governorship advised Her Majesty's Government to acquire them from the French, even at the expense of the British Settlements on the Gambia.  \n8. That since the inauguration of the New Tariff in 1872, whereby the duties on spirits and tobacco were increased, a disposition to evade those duties has been manifested by the native tribes who are the principal consumers, and been very largely gratified by the establishment of factories along the small and great Scarcies Rivers on the north, and between the Calmont Creek and Bargroo on the south, from which the goods being there free from duties, can be procured at a cheaper rate than in Sierra Leone, and often in the case of the Scarcies, smuggled through British waters to Port Lokkoh and other native dominions, to which the easiest access is by water through the Sierra Leone River.  \n9. That respecting the Scarcies, your petitioners would further state that even if a vigilant and effective Water Police could be appointed to guard against smuggling by native canoes coming from the north through the Sierra Leone River, the overland communication between the Scarcies and Port Lokkoh Rivers is so comparatively easy, that the activity of the police would most probably result in entirely driving the trade from Sierra Leone into channels over which the British Government can exercise no control.  \n10. That owing to the advantages offered for the evasion of and exemption from the duties, the large number of native traders who formerly came here to trade, now stay away from the Settlement; and that the consequence has been that little business is done in Sierra Leone in comparison to the trade of former years, and there has been a necessity for the local Legislature to employ various devices—by the taxation of exports and otherwise—to raise a sinking revenue.  \n11. That even a great proportion of the articles of export could have found their way direct from the Scarcies and some of the other producing centres to the markets for which they are ultimately intended, but for the shipping which is more easily obtained at Sierra Leone.  \n12. That your lordship's petitioners would crave leave further to assert their belief that whatever difficulties may oppose the transfer of the Melicourie territories already occupied by the French, are not likely to interpose themselves, with respect to the Scarcies whose chiefs and princes in 1872, when they were visited by Governor Pope Hennessy, expressed their entire concurrence to cede their territories to the British Crown. And your lordship's petitioners also firmly believe that the chiefs whose territories divide the peninsula of Sierra Leone from British Sherbro, will be found to yield to negotiations for a cession of their territories.  \n13. That your lordship's petitioners are convinced that the acquisition of the territories above mentioned will not only secure a prosperous development of the Sierra Leone trade, but will enable the Government even upon reduction of existing duties to procure a revenue ample for all the wants of the Settlement, and especially for meeting the sanitary and other improvements urgently needed, but at present sadly neglected for want of funds. Nor have your petitioners lost sight of the beneficial influence which British possession of those territories will have for the spread in Africa of religion, civilization, and commerce, hitherto considerably retarded in this part of Africa by continuous petty native feuds, to which, nevertheless, as your petitioners sincerely believe, the acquisition of the lands by the British Crown will put an end.  \nYour lordship's petitioners therefore humbly pray that your lordship will be pleased to recommend to Her Majesty's Government the acquisition, either by purchase or by treaty engagements, of the native dominions from the Scarcies Rivers on the north to the Bargroo River on the south of the peninsula of Sierra Leone.  \nAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.  \n(Here follow a large number of signatures)."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-08-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: A Promising Future—The House & Land Tax Ordinance', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From the many evils attendant on the operation and working of the House & Land Tax Ordinances in Sierra Leone, in my own knowledge and experience, ere it was abolished by that much-esteemed and time-honoured Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, to whom some signal tribute of respect was recently paid by grateful Sierra Leoneans; and having noticed with satisfaction how earnestly your able journal discusses all public matters, particularly in such cases, permit me, through the medium of your columns, to enter a solemn protest against its introduction into our little island Lagos.

I fear no contradiction by saying that none of the European or West Indian officials come to the coast of Africa for the love of civilisation, or for the improvement of that country, nor would it be reasonable to suppose such a hypothesis. It is a well-known fact that no love of Africa brought them there. Who ought therefore to be the best judge of what is good for a country? the foreign official who considers Africa as a means of earning his salary with a view to leave after a few years on half-pay, or perhaps a pension, or the individual who belongs to the soil, to which only he can look for his own improvement and social elevation? Much has been said against the introduction of a partially self-governing principle in the colony; and the stereotyped argument has been, ""Africans are not ripe yet for self-government;"" which, not being based upon the fact of experiment, but simply on supposition, will no doubt be used until Africans prove the contrary—a circumstance which, under the present system, would be rather difficult.\n\nI am personally acquainted with numerous liberated Africans who were landed at Sierra Leone from the captured slave-ships;—several of them within my own knowledge—in a perfect state of nudity. Of these there are a great many who, at present, live in decent houses, and are well to do; several standing at the head of, for the colony, important houses of business, and enjoying a credit from English merchants. All these men knew how to make their position literally from nothing, and know how to maintain it; is it not therefore reasonable to suppose that they would be able to assist practically in the Legislature? They certainly know as well what is good for their country as any of the present members of the Legislature.

The excess of £14,000 in the revenue derived from Customs is due to the unprecedented importation of firearms and ammunition which took place during the year, but the Governor adds, I have reason to believe that each succeeding year will show a marked improvement on the preceding one, although the increase may not be so large as the present.

This excess was owing to the fact that a sum of £8,454, balance due to the Imperial Government, was repaid by the direction of the Secretary of State.

We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

The latter disputed that they had given up either their lands or their sovereignty, and also the black foreigners' aim of cutting down the main overseas commercial activity carried on in the area, namely the slave trade. The Reverend Jehudi Ashmun stood up to this opposition with 450 settlers, 200 of whom were liberated Africans.

However, had the Commission made an objective study of contemporary European colonial policies, it would have been less harsh on the Liberian government's errors of omission or commission and perhaps less ready to endorse 'white administration' of Liberia, since the European colonial regimes were equally, if not more, brutal than Liberia in some of their policies towards their colonial subjects, including the use of forced labour for public works. 86 Reacting to the Christy Report, the League of Nations pressed Liberia to abolish slavery and the export of labour to Fernando Po, to reorganize the Liberian government, and to institute basic reforms to give equal opportunities for all Liberians. On its own part the United States govern› ment expressed 'profound shock' at the 'shocking suppression of the natives' revealed in the Report. It urged that in order not to strain traditional United States-Liberian relations, the Liberian government must promptly abolish 'the twin scourges of slavery and forced labor' and carry out 'a compre- hensive system of reforms ...'$^{87}$ This statement led to the institution of impeachment proceedings by the Liberian Legislature against VicePresident Allen Yancy (who was a labour recruiting agent) and President King (Plate"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of Senegambia and Upper Guinea', 'section_title': 'Upper Guinea and Futa Jallon', 'content': 'The case of Morea well illustrates the socio-cultural phenomenon that had been at work on the Rivers Coast since the eighteenth century. Peoples speaking various languages and living in coastal agricultural civilizations had in the sixteenth century been subjected to northern influence through the agency of the Somba invasion, but had absorbed it. Thereafter, with the arrival of Sudanic traders on the coast, these old cultures were radically changed. Mandinka and Fulbe lineages settled everywhere, became pol› itically dominant and introduced new ideas of politics. Egalitarian, rela› tively unstratified societies thus came to accept organization into warrior chiefdoms and semi-centralized states. These peoples nevertheless retained their cultural identities: the newcomers, few in number, were completely assimilated linguistically. This phenomenon covered essentially southern Susu country and the domains of the Limba, Loko, and Temne. It stopped short abruptly at Sierra Leone, that is, on the verge of the forest lands of the south, which had mainly stayed closed to the Sudanic trade routes. But major social effects extended well beyond that. Thus, from the Temne to the Kpelle of Liberia social and political life was dominated by great initiation societies, the best known of which, that for men, was often called Poron (compare the Poro of the Senufo).$^{8}$ Hence, this was a basic social phenomenon transcending the borders of the historical areas just defined.\nThe Loko, the advance guard of the Mende, were isolated between the Temne and the Limba with their backs to the sea.

By 1827, however, an embryonic development process had started. The main emphasis was laid, at first, on the production of food, and especially of rice, but efforts were also directed towards the cultivation of export crops and the exploitation of local natural resources: in the first category there were sugar, ginger and indigo, and in the second there were coffee and exotic timber. An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony. Its ships began to ply the waters along the West African coast as far as the Bight of Biafra. Foreign ships were thenceforth able to put in safely to ports in the estuary for the purpose of the legitimate trade so earnestly desired by the abolitionists. However, the significance of this 'take-off' should not be exaggerated: it simply showed that the experiment was viable, with a minimum of administrative support from the European metropolis.\nAll things considered, the British government's action in 1853 in making the Sierra Leoneans subjects of the Crown represented implicit recognition of the fact that a heterogeneous medley of cultures had been welded together into a viable Creole society. A 'civilized' nation had been created not according to some Utopian European model but by the strength of its own genius.$^{39}$ The part that was obviously played by the British antislavery movement left intact the character of an African solution."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': ""It was a challenge by the British to the country's legal existence that led to de jure independence.

It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Brookes (the agent of Mr. Chown during his absence in England) that at an early hour on the day the alleged robbery took place, he carried into the office the sum of fifty-six pounds odd, and deposited it there in the presence of the clerks. Some time after ten a.m., when all the clerks had retired to their homes for breakfast, the money was missed and Jacobs was suspected. Mr. Brookes communicated his suspicion to his friend the Rev. G. Nicol, Colonial Chaplain, who informed Jacobs of the suspicion thrown upon his character, and advised him to deliver up the money to him, when Mr. Brookes would not prevent his going away to Sierra Leone. Jacobs denied the charge, and threatened legal proceedings against Mr. Nicol for falsely accusing him. Mr. Brookes therefore took proceedings against Jacobs, who was charged with having committed the robbery, on the ground that on the same day he was seen walking in the streets with something under his arm. The prisoner defended his own case and endeavoured to prove that he was not in the office when the robbery was committed.

On the other hand, the coloured people are convinced that, with Mr. Huggins on the bench, they can never hope for justice and under this conviction whenever an attempt at assault is made on them they return the assault, instead of seeking redress in a court of justice as heretofore.

The day came, but the beads did not come. The smith shuffled three months, after which time Mr. Johnson gave information of the transaction to Mr. Montagu, then acting police magistrate, Cap-Bravo being at the time Acting Administrator, who forthwith directed a constable to go with Johnson and demand the property, adding, ""If he do not deliver, bring him before me."" The smith could not deliver, and he was brought before the magistrate. Papah Booyah produced in Court some beads which he gave in evidence he had made with Johnson\'s gold and for Johnson. Johnson satisfied the Court that both the size and pattern of the beads produced were different to what he had bargained for. The case then came within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, where, after it was argued, the jury found a verdict against the defendant; and Mr. Huggins, Acting Chief Justice, sentenced him to nine months\' imprisonment. But the Judge here reckoned without his host. Papah Booyah is a Jolloff man—the Acting Administrator is known to be very friendly with a distinguished personage of Jolloff descent, to whom it is believed he could not deny a request. You can guess the rest. Law and justice were set aside, and the very next day after sentence was pronounced, the goldsmith was liberated from prison, an attorney was engaged, and a new trial granted. The new trial was heard in the Judge\'s Chamber; the Acting Assistant Judge (Montagu) stuck to the side of justice; his compeer (Huggins), being under superior influence, went the other way. The Judges thus disagreeing, an adjournment was adopted. At the next sitting of the Supreme Court the case was again called up, but when the Crown Prosecutor saw the composition of the jury (a special one), he in disgust met the Judge\'s wish more than half-way by retiring from the case without further ado, and Papah Booyah is safe. Vengeance, however, was in reserve for the plaintiff Johnson. He ventured to interrogate the bench whether his gold would be returned to him, and manifesting surprise when told that it would not, the Judge declared him guilty of contempt of court, and ordered Johnson to be imprisoned for a week, or pay a fine of 5l. The money was paid, and the loss to Johnson was thus increased to 9l. 19s.\n\nThe feelings of the community, the jurymen in particular who had found Papah Booyah guilty, have been grossly outraged; but what of the outraged feelings of a negro community?—I remain, yours truly,', 'last_edit_date': '1867-06-15', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1867#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Petition for Re-establishing Trial by Jury in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Your petitioners would beg most respectfully to assure your lordship that the motives which led to sweeping away of one of the chief rights of Her Majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects in this settlement were other than they were represented to be.

Nothing, in our opinion, could justify such a change in the Civil Courts of a British colony, but, either that the right of trial by jury had been so abused as to make its withdrawal a matter of necessity, or that the people themselves had desired to be relieved of the safeguard which a jury bestows. We have heard disappointed suitors in England say that they had so high a confidence in the superior English judges that they would have preferred the decision of the judge in their cause to the verdict of a jury. We think that all who hold such an opinion are totally wrong, and that the preservation of the high, independent, unimpeachable judicial character of the ornaments of the Bench in Great Britain and Ireland is best guaranteed by the continued control of juries, in addition to that of a watchful free press. But who would dare to institute a comparison between any two of even the least eminent of our British judges, and a Huggins and a Montagu? The late decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Sierra Leone appeal cases show how utterly wanting is the former in independence or talent, while for the unfitness of the latter we can refer to documents which appear in our present number.

In our leader on the subject we recorded, without fear or favour, our opinion of a judge so situate as Judge French, taking three weeks to decide upon a case which the jury, had there been a jury, must have pronounced upon after only a few minutes\' or hours\' deliberation. The same number of the African Times contained, also, our report of the speech of Mr. Rainy in support of his application to the same judge for a new trial of the cause, before him, that selfsame judge; as also the intelligence that Mr. Chief Justice French had taken certain days to decide whether he should grant the application. He did take, it seems, some ten days to consider whether he would grant this application, which should set aside a judgment that had cost him twenty-one days\' examination and reflection; and on the 31st January (see page ), he granted the application for a new trial!

We have appended to the brief report of the sitting of the Court on the occasion in question, some pertinent and pungent remarks of the Day Spring, on this, we presume, almost unparalleled judicial absurdity.

And the more we reflect on the subject, the more we feel that the course pursued by Judge French in this suit of Rainy v. Bravo, from the 30th November, when he took time to consider his judgment, to the 31st December, when he announced that he would not uphold his judgment, could only have been pursued by a judge in barracks (vide our December number). It affords as striking a condemnation of a judge living in military barracks, as it does of the act of Blackall, Huggins, Bravo and others, and through their devices of the Colonial-office, in having robbed the people of Sierra Leone of the right of trial by jury.

A few remarks may be necessary in explanation. In criminal cases the question submitted to the jury upon the evidence is a very simple one—viz., ""Whether the prisoner be guilty or not guilty;"" and in well-conducted prosecutions the whole of the evidence bears upon that point. Further, qualified jurors are usually persons of some property, and they have an interest in the repression of crime, and in giving security to life and property by their verdicts. In civil suits the case is somewhat different. These suits are usually actions arising out of commercial transactions and complicated accounts. The issues raised by the pleadings are oftentimes many and various. The litigating parties, if not on friendly terms with the jurors, are generally well known to them. And the opposing attorneys, contending for success and for their costs, not infrequently bewilder and distract them by the mass of matter they adduce in evidence in the hope of influencing them in their verdict. Add to all this the advocacy of these attorneys, without any public opinion to check them in their course, and the jealousies existing between the different races and tribes inhabiting these settlements, and it is not to be wondered at that verdicts in civil suits on this coast should have given less satisfaction than verdicts in criminal cases. With the right of appeal given by these Ordinances, and the provisions before referred to for taking down the evidence by the officer of the court, I think the decision of civil suits may be safely left to the resident magistrates at the other settlements, and to the judges of the Supreme Court at Sierra Leone, without a jury.\n\n[Here follows the celebrated Ordinance No. IV., 1866, 16th November, already published in *African Times*, vide January, 1867.]\n\n*Extract from Governor-General Blackall to Secretary of State, December 8, 1866.*', 'last_edit_date': '1867-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1867#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Parliamentary Papers: Sierra Leone, Etc.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—I have the honour to return herewith the petition from Sierra Leone against the confirmation of Ordinance No. IV., lately passed by the Legislative Council of that settlement. The petitioners appear to be principally marksmen who could hardly have understood the language used in the petition. The objection seems to be against the 11th section of the Ordinance, which provides that actions at law shall be tried by one or more of the judges of the Supreme Court, without a jury. This provision has not been made without due consideration.\n\nBy referring to the Report of the Select Committee appointed in 1865, to consider the state of the British settlements on the Coast, it will be seen that Colonel Ord, the Government Commissioner, and other witnesses examined before the Committee, stated it to be their opinion that some alteration was necessary to improve the administration of justice under the present jury system. They thought it worked fairly, on the whole, in criminal cases, but not in civil causes. In the Draft Report prepared by the Chairman of the Committee, it will also be seen that the opinion is expressed that trial by jury was inapplicable in many cases.\n\nMy own experience on the Coast leads to the same conclusion. In civil cases it is a system unsuited to the present condition of these settlements. It is uncertain in its results, and attended with heavy and unnecessary expense. Further, the number of qualified jurors is very limited, and most of them but very imperfectly understand the English language. They are also usually known to the litigating parties, and they are liable to be swayed by the views of the local attorneys who practise in the Courts both as attorneys and advocates. Another disturbing cause to the fair administration of justice under this system is to be found in the numerous tribes and races inhabiting these settlements, their clanship, and the jealousies existing between them. For these and other reasons it is believed many persons prefer to compromise their claims, or to desist from prosecuting them, rather than submit their cases to the decisions of juries on the Coast.\n\nIn conclusion, I would beg leave to refer to the 12th section of the Ordinance, providing that, on the trial of all civil causes in the Supreme Court, the evidence given at the trial shall be taken down in writing by the officer of the Court. With this provision for taking down the evidence, and with an appeal to Her Majesty in Council, I apprehend there is ample security that justice will be fairly administered by the judges of the Court, and greater satisfaction given than by the present jury system. I may add, suits where the damages do not exceed 100l. are now tried by the Chief Justice of the Settlement without a jury, under an Ordinance passed in 1864.\n\nRespectfully submitting these observations for the consideration of the Earl of Carnarvon.—I have, &c.,', 'last_edit_date': '1867-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1867#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trial by Jury in Crown Colonies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have received from Sierra Leone a copy of a pamphlet, entitled ""The Cry of the People of Sierra Leone,"" for the restoration of the Jury-system in civil actions.

The African Times articles further illustrate this bias by recounting instances where Europeans received lenient treatment for offenses against Africans, such as a mere 3s fine for assault in Lagos, while Africans faced harsher penalties for similar offenses. The disparity in sentencing is evident in the case of Thomas Lubley, a European who received only four months' imprisonment for a heinous crime against a young African girl. The abolition of trial by jury in civil cases, perceived as a move to protect European interests, and accounts of judicial corruption and partiality further underscore the skewed legal system.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

The smith shuffled three months, after which time Mr. Johnson gave information of the transaction to Mr. Montagu, then acting police magistrate, Cap-Bravo being at the time Acting Administrator, who forthwith directed a constable to go with Johnson and demand the property, adding, ""If he do not deliver, bring him before me."" The smith could not deliver, and he was brought before the magistrate. Papah Booyah produced in Court some beads which he gave in evidence he had made with Johnson\'s gold and for Johnson. Johnson satisfied the Court that both the size and pattern of the beads produced were different to what he had bargained for. The case then came within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, where, after it was argued, the jury found a verdict against the defendant; and Mr. Huggins, Acting Chief Justice, sentenced him to nine months\' imprisonment. But the Judge here reckoned without his host. Papah Booyah is a Jolloff man—the Acting Administrator is known to be very friendly with a distinguished personage of Jolloff descent, to whom it is believed he could not deny a request. You can guess the rest. Law and justice were set aside, and the very next day after sentence was pronounced, the goldsmith was liberated from prison, an attorney was engaged, and a new trial granted. The new trial was heard in the Judge\'s Chamber; the Acting Assistant Judge (Montagu) stuck to the side of justice; his compeer (Huggins), being under superior influence, went the other way. The Judges thus disagreeing, an adjournment was adopted. At the next sitting of the Supreme Court the case was again called up, but when the Crown Prosecutor saw the composition of the jury (a special one), he in disgust met the Judge\'s wish more than half-way by retiring from the case without further ado, and Papah Booyah is safe. Vengeance, however, was in reserve for the plaintiff Johnson. He ventured to interrogate the bench whether his gold would be returned to him, and manifesting surprise when told that it would not, the Judge declared him guilty of contempt of court, and ordered Johnson to be imprisoned for a week, or pay a fine of 5l. The money was paid, and the loss to Johnson was thus increased to 9l. 19s.\n\nThe feelings of the community, the jurymen in particular who had found Papah Booyah guilty, have been grossly outraged; but what of the outraged feelings of a negro community?—I remain, yours truly,'}, {'id': 1356, 'article_title': 'How Justice is done at Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'How Justice is done at Lagos', 'last_edit_date': '04-06-1868', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1868#article-20', 'issue_date': '23_05_1868', 'content': 'Sir,—The atrocious case of rape on that little girl of seven to eight years of age came before the Court to-day.

Well, every one was waiting anxiously to hear the Judge or Chief Magistrate, Mr. Wey, pass his sentence for this filthy crime. We were quite astounded when we heard that sentence passed; four months\' imprisonment with hard labour; actually for forcing and ravishing a girl of about seven years of age, who bled for four days profusely, and but for medical skill must have died—four months\' imprisonment! We have had cases of this kind tried before by the same Judge—of course not so bad as this. A prisoner who had been already beaten half dead, was brought here for trial from Palma. He was tried and condemned. We say condemned. The judge before he passed his sentence promised to be lenient, with the hope he should not catch him again.

If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**""}, {'id': 1610, 'article_title': 'AGAINST MILITARY MAGISTRATES.', 'full_section_title': 'AGAINST MILITARY MAGISTRATES.', 'last_edit_date': '06-03-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1869#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_08_1869', 'content': ""Sir,—I believe that everyone who has the honour of being a British subject, is justly entitled to the privilege and protection which British laws afford.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**""}, {'id': 3714, 'article_title': 'A Grossly Inadequate Punishment', 'full_section_title': 'A Grossly Inadequate Punishment', 'last_edit_date': '11-29-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_02_1879', 'content': 'Sir,—Permit me to expose, in the columns of your valuable paper, a gross perversion of justice in a criminal case tried on the 26th instant, before his Honour Judge Jackson, ""Regina v.

If so, no wonder many come out from England simply to benefit their pockets, without regard to the African\'s cause or interest; _e.g._, the revenue of Lagos is about £50,000 per annum; of this sum only £600 is granted to the various bodies of Missionary Societies for education here, whilst about £6,000 is spent annually for ""passages"" and ""travelling allowances"" of European officials to and from England, extension of leave, &c., and the rest for high wages.

Kidd and M'Coskry, of Liverpool. His victim was a little girl eight years of age. We cannot enter into the filthy details, though all the evidence is before us. He was tried on the 6th of the present month. The result is, in our opinion, disgraceful to the jury, and not so creditable as we could wish to the judge. How any jury could, upon the evidence, have acquitted Lubley of the *rape*, when among other conclusive evidence it was proved that the poor child was bleeding during four days, we cannot possibly conceive. But we hope to get some explanation of this. Having, however, thus escaped upon the capital charge, he pleaded *Guilty* to that of criminal assault with attempt, &c.; and here, again, his good fortune did not desert him. The judge sentenced him to *four months' imprisonment*, with hard labour. This last part, of course, for a *European* at Lagos is a farce; and so four months' imprisonment is considered adequate punishment for that act of beastly atrocity. One of our duties is to demand equal justice for the coloured and white subjects of Her Majesty in Lagos and elsewhere on the West Coast; and we ask, would the trial have had such results if the child had been white, the daughter of a European resident at Lagos, and the criminal one of the educated Africans there? We do not hesitate to say that the accused would have been found guilty of the capital offence, and been hung or sentenced to imprisonment for a long term of years; or, even supposing the impossibility that he could have had the good fortune of Lubley and been acquitted of the capital offence, we are quite sure that for the criminal assault he would, and most deservedly, have been sentenced, even by that same judge, to four years, instead of four months' imprisonment.

Were your lordship to order an inquiry to be made in this matter, your petitioners feel certain that it would reveal such cruelties and wrongs to the African race as to make honest Englishmen blush at the dark deeds committed by a certain class of their countrymen; and would show what abuse of power Europeans of a certain order are capable of, when allowed the free exercise of their natural propensities, and unrestrained by law.

At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among the visible means for the accomplishment of the great work of the Christian civilization of Africa, we have ever pointed to a possible immigration into Africa of considerable numbers of American negroes released from the cruel yoke of slavery.

831,The reliance on potentially unreliable witness testimony in colonial African courts highlights significant weaknesses in the judicial process of the time.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the significant weaknesses in the colonial African judicial process, particularly concerning the reliance on potentially unreliable witness testimony. The General History of Africa highlights the imposition of European judicial systems that often disregarded African customary and Muslim laws, leading to modifications that could undermine the reliability of witness testimony. In British and Belgian territories, attempts to incorporate African customary law through 'native courts' were still subject to European norms, potentially affecting the credibility of testimonies. White magistrates, unfamiliar with local legal systems, often relied on personal instincts, compromising judicial outcomes, while the untrained and overbearing African police force further complicated the process. Although the textbook does not explicitly discuss witness testimony, these systemic challenges align with the claim of judicial weaknesses. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide specific instances, such as the cases of Whobay and Abudukadiri, where convictions were heavily influenced by questionable witness testimonies, leading to doubts about trial fairness and miscarriages of justice. The articles also highlight broader issues of partiality and incompetence among judges, further compounding the judicial shortcomings. Together, these sources illustrate how the reliance on unreliable witness testimony and systemic judicial flaws were prevalent in colonial African courts, supporting the claim of significant weaknesses in the judicial process of the time.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights into the colonial judicial processes that can be associated with the claim regarding the reliance on potentially unreliable witness testimony.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.581, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.584, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years? This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

It is clear also that at the same time the European presence was undermining those structures and constituted a grave threat to African security. This was the more so because the success of the African leaders had been achieved at the cost of what may be called the legacy of wars.\nThere had emerged larger, stronger states with a tendency towards the concentration of executive power in individuals and specific title holders directly responsible to the ruler, and officials gaining office more by merit, achievement and favour of the ruler than by hereditary rights. In the process of achieving such stronger states with a more effective concentration of executive power, weaker states had disappeared. Various groups in danger of losing power and various vested interests adversely affected had fought back and wars had become endemic. The more the Europeans perceived this growth of African state power, the more they were deter› mined to frustrate it, and they were able to exploit this legacy of wars to create divisions and provide opportunities for intervention.\nThe states that emerged had evolved more durable political institutions that were generally more effective than ever before in exacting the demands of the ruler on the ruled. This, as we have noted above, implied a clearer delimitation of jurisdiction and a clearer definition of frontiers. Perhaps it also heightened the consciousness of the value of land. At any rate, wars became more ruthless and more total than hitherto. They were usually fought not merely to establish the relative authorities of competing rulers, but affected the fortunes of society as a whole: the victor not infrequently took the bulk of able-bodied persons among the vanquished as captives, seized land and cattle and sometimes annexed the whole community with a subsequent loss of their identity.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.575, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North Africa and the Sahara', 'section_title': 'Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance', 'content': ""One group was in continual touch with the Sultan, served him and appealed to him when the colonial threat loomed; the others acted under the influence of the local djema'a.

The law presumes a person to be alive until he has been proved to be dead. If this letter had been proved to be genuine, then the point would be at once settled. Does that letter bring to my mind that the plaintiff's first wife is dead? I must confess it does not. If it had been a genuine one surely he must have heard again, and I must say that sufficient evidence does not satisfy me that she is dead. The party who alleges the death must prove it. In point of fact that letter is not worth anything. Defendant has stated that a Captain Webber had told him she was alive. It is just possible that defendant will be able to prove it.

At that trial it was stated by one Sarah Thomas, the principal and only witness called to prove the murder, that after Gondomah was captured, the prisoner, along with the war party on the 14th of March last, carried Patience Peters with other prisoners out of Gondomah, and some time after they had left Gondomah the prisoners murdered Patience Peters ""at a war-fence far up in the bush, out of British jurisdiction.""

We must confess to the truth, that the evidence of Sarah Thomas so completely influenced us, that we were convinced that the woman Patience Peters had been murdered at the war-fence. The point raised by the prisoner\'s counsel changed the issue, particularly so, as the only witness who proved the murder also proved that it took place out of British territory. This fact completely upset the case, and the jury, consistent with the charge of his Honour the Chief Justice, set the prisoner free; not on the ground, we have every reason to believe, that he did not commit the alleged murder, but on the ground that this Court could not take cognisance of a murder committed by an alien out of British jurisdiction.

Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Another Petition for a Better Administration of the Law in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Owing to the painful suspense in which suitors are kept by the delays of the judges, and the unnecessary expense to which they are often put by repeated adjournments, the courts are being gradually deserted, so that at the last sitting there was but one civil case brought before the Supreme Court.

The same thing was tried here the other day. Mr. Macleod came down in Christmas week with the intention of hearing the appeal cases in which he had given judgment in the Court below. But we object to this sort of thing, and protested against it, contending that he could not sit as Acting Chief Justice to try again the cases he had before decided, as he had the casting vote, and could only confirm his former decision. In addition to this, the Acting Puisne Judge, who was to sit with him, is Mr. Turton, who is not a legal or professional gentleman. As soon, therefore, as the Court met on Tuesday, the 28th December, at 8 A.M., Mr. Macleod took the initiative, and said that he understood from his brother (Turton) that objection would be raised against his sitting as Chief Justice. He considered it better, therefore, to adjourn the Appeal sittings until the arrival of Chief Justice Marshall. This is well. Africans do not know how to appeal from A to A. Such a thing is manifestly wrong, and a great disgrace to any Judge who does it. We have heard on good authority that Mr. Woodcock's last act at Accra was to introduce an Ordinance, and press it through the Council at one sitting, enacting that trial by jury in all criminal cases should be abolished (excepting capital offences of murder and manslaughter); the trials to be before Assessors and Judge; the Assessors to have only the power to express an opinion, the Judge alone to pronounce verdict and sentence. By this, a Governor or Government, or the Queen's Advocate, might influence the Judge (who might not care about the African, owing to his colour) to convict him wrongly. We have no faith here in anything but trial by jury.\n\nThe Council at Accra sit, of course, with closed doors, and no voice of the colony is to be heard there by the officials assembled. We can scarcely think that the Secretary of State for the Colonies will approve of an Ordinance thus passed, giving over the liberties of every one into the hands of the Executive; and we hope he will not."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trial by Jury at the River Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are disappointed. The old official leaven has triumphed, and, according to our view, a great error has been committed. Where we had looked for light, behold thick darkness! Our readers will not have overlooked the correspondence and copies of memorials in the African Times, during past months, on the important subject of ""Trial by Jury"" at the Gambia, in both criminal and civil cases. The battle, if we may so term it, between officialism, which espoused the cause of some half a dozen European mercantile agents and traders on the one hand, and the native population on the other, commenced with the failure to obtain conviction on two charges of wrongfully disposing of property by native traders up the River who had been entrusted with goods for sale by an importer at Bathurst. The jury would not convict; they could not agree, there being a minority for acquittal. The cases were fully stated in our columns, by the prosecutor on the one hand, and Mr. Thomas Quin, foreman of the jury, and one of the dissenting minority, on the other. The latter expressed his firm conviction of the innocence of the accused, exposed certain errors on the part of the Chief Magistrate, and stated his belief that when the trials were resumed, as they were to be, before the Chief Justice from Sierra Leone, the ruling of the Judge would be in favour of the prisoners, and they would be again acquitted. And this proved to be correct. Meanwhile, however, the official and European elements had lost no time in dealing with the matter. An Ordinance was framed and sent home for approval, abolishing trial by jury in criminal cases of that description, and substituting therefor trial by the Chief Magistrate and two Commissioners or two Justices of the Peace. The native traders, in a body, memorialized the Secretary of State against such a change in the law, praying him to disapprove of the same. If the following, which came by the last mail, be correct, and we see no reason for disbelieving it, the decision has gone against them. The Earl of Derby is stated to have replied: ""I have to request you to inform the memorialists that I have read their memorial; that I cannot attach any weight to the charge which they make against the Judges and the Magistrates in the West African settlements of partiality in the administration of justice, unsupported by any instances of alleged miscarriage of justice; and that I see no reason to reverse my predecessor\'s decision that an alteration of the law as to the mode of trial of the particular offences in question is desirable.""', 'last_edit_date': '1883-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How Justice is Administered on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—In your deep interest for Africa, you will excuse my saying that you cannot possibly insist too much upon the point you have dwelt upon in your two last issues—viz., the mode of the administration of justice in the new Government of the Gold Coast; for I am certain you must have heard often from other sources how great maladministration has been in time past, lately, and is even now practised by local magistrates. I will give you an evidence of this. Mr. X., our Chief Magistrate, acts the part of counsel in every case where his friend Mr. Y. is concerned. This Mr. Y. is the agent here of Mr. A. (of — in England), the trustee and receiver of the estate of A., B., and Co., and C. and Co. From the moment Mr. X. landed here, Mr. Y. (knowing he has many cases to come before Mr. X. in one of which he is aware he has little or no grounds in) took care to give board and lodging to Mr. X., and they have become so intimate that, although Mr. X. has since procured his own lodgings a long way off, he has several times heard cases in chambers at Mr. Y.'s house, and in those cases Mr. Y. was plaintiff. One or two cases have been thus handled, Mr. X. acting more as counsel than as judge; so that the parties concerned would have appealed to the Sierra Leone Court of Appeal, had not an insuperable difficulty been in the way, which frightens poor or prudent traders from incurring the risks which they would otherwise run. I will give you one instance. A Mr. D. gave Mr. E. a bill of exchange on A., B., and Co., in 1872, for 150l. The bill was returned dishonoured. Mr. E. sued Mr. D., and obtained judgment from the then Chief Magistrate, Mr. F. Mr. E. issued a writ to recover 150l. from Mr. D. Mr. D. having accounts with A., B., and Co., pending settlement with Mr. Y., and Mr. E. owing A., B., and Co. 101l., Mr. D., in open court, requested Mr. Y. to debit his account with the 101l., and he would give Mr. E. the balance—viz., 49l. Mr. Y. agreed to this before Judge F., and ordered his clerk to give Mr. E. a receipt for 101l., which the Sheriff considered as partly satisfying the judgment debt of 150l., and therefore recovered from Mr. D. and paid Mr. E. only 49l. and the costs. Now Mr. Y. and Mr. D., six months after, came to settlement of account, and it was alleged that Mr. D. had to pay Mr. Y. a large balance. Mr. Y. now objected to Mr. D.'s account to Mr. E. of 101l., and sued Mr. E. for it. Mr. Magistrate X. would not look at the receipt of Mr. Y.'s clerk, produced by Mr. E., nor listen to any representation from Mr. E., but accepted Mr. Y.'s denial of all knowledge of it as true, although Mr. Y.'s clerk and the Sheriff could have been examined if the Judge would only have listened; but being aware that Mr. E. is not in a position to overcome the great barrier in the way of the Court of Appeal, took advantage of it and did his own way for his friend. I give you this simple detail of facts as a small proof of the evils resulting from having local Judges; and it would be a great blessing to us all if we could have Circuit Judges: although where Europeans and Africans are concerned in court, there will not always, perhaps, even then, be that fair impartiality in allowing for the African's defects in English in representing his case, yet there will be by far a better decision, where a gentleman is appointed as Judge, and is not, in any sense, resident.—Yours truly, L.

We have shown that the Assistant-Judge, by having placed himself in direct antagonism with the people of the West Coast, by aiding and abetting in depriving them of the safeguard of trial by jury in civil causes, and in advocating their being deprived of it also in criminal causes, can never again inspire confidence among them; can never regain their good will; and must be always more or less odious and hateful in their eyes; that his proved incompetency as a lawyer, one of the results of which was to bring heavy charges upon the Treasury of Sierra Leone, prevents the possibility of his being regarded by them with any legal respect that might mitigate the feelings produced by his conduct as regards trial by jury; that the excessive and illegal severity of sentences passed by him on convicted criminals in the Supreme Court, established in him an utter unfitness to be entrusted with judicial powers; and that his conduct in the matter of Fyfe v. Huggins has so aggravated the catalogue of his disqualifications for the exercise of such powers, that his removal from the office of Judge in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal in Sierra Leone has become one of the absolutely necessary measures for completing the organisation of that court. And although his Grace the Duke of Buckingham could not discover this odious unfitness and his legal disqualification by aid of his pocket rule, as he could the dimensions of a Government office, and has, therefore, grievously disappointed the just expectations of the people of Sierra Leone, our duty is clear—and that is to urge and re-urge on every occasion, and in every possible constitutional manner, upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies for the time being the removal of Mr. Justice Huggins, and the complete and efficient organisation of the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. If we could not have shown that this complete organisation, so indispensable and so urgent, could be effected without any undue charge on the revenues of Sierra Leone, we might have felt compelled to leave the question in abeyance. But we have shown, that it can be so effected, and this with manifest advantage to the character of Great Britain and of every settlement on the West Coast, because, without increasing the charges on any settlement beyond what it can well afford to bear, and would willingly bear in order to have justice properly administered within its precincts, it will enable every one of them to get rid of local magisterial tyrants, who, by flagrant injustice, by mad caprice, and by the most offensive partiality, have brought the so-called administration of justice among them, under the name of British law, into loathing dread and contempt with the people. And it is in the further discharge of this duty that we publish in the present number the residue of the official correspondence in the matter of Fyfe v. Huggins. Our readers will perceive that the old course, which we have so often denounced, was pursued by the Duke of Buckingham and Mr. Adderley. They do not send to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone to inquire personally, or to constitute a court to inquire into the truth or falsehood of the charges brought against the judicial offender; but they send to him personally and take and accept his personal statements, without inquiry into their truth or falsehood, as a sufficient answer to those charges, in spite of the legal proofs by which they were accompanied; and add to this an unwarrantable stigma of falsehood on the eminent barrister, the indefatigable and undaunted advocate of African rights and liberties, Mr. Wm. Rainy, who had brought these matters under the notice of the Colonial office in the name of the people of Sierra Leone, to whom he has become so deservedly dear. In placing the issue on such grounds the late Secretary of State and Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies have placed Mr. Rainy in this position, that as he has facts, indisputable facts, on his side, he will not be able—he cannot with due regard to that reputation which he is bound to preserve untarnished, not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the African people—he must not cease from his charges against the Assistant-Judge until those charges are disproved before a competent authority in Sierra Leone, or declared by such authority to be established; and Mr. Justice Huggins be in consequence removed to some other sphere of official duty, where, it might be hoped, he would not commit those errors which we, with Mr. Rainy, assert have disqualified him for a judgeship in Sierra Leone or in any settlement on the West Coast of Africa. We have no doubt that in pursuance of this duty on the part of Mr. Rainy the whole matter will be brought directly—and not indirectly, as heretofore—under the notice of the House of Commons. We therefore felt it necessary to put on record in our pages the additional documents which we publish in this present number, and to which we beg especially to direct the attention of our readers. We have no hope that the stream of law and justice administered in the name of Great Britain along the West Coast of Africa can be made either palatable or pure until the source be made sweet, the fountain-head be made pure at Sierra Leone. In our efforts for this we do not look upon ourself as doing the work of a day; a work only for the present time; but as laying the foundations of a structure that is to be an enduring ornament and a safe and sure refuge—a temple of justice on the West Coast of Africa that will endure (should the present mundane system endure) for ages after we have passed from the busy scenes of earthly usefulness and struggle—when our advocacy of African interests will most possibly have ceased altogether to be remembered, and we shall be to Africans of that day as though we had never been; had never fought to obtain an adequate, enlightened, and upright Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for Sierra Leone and the whole of the West Coast settlements.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1869#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CASE OF J.

Davies, at Lagos, with his subsequent trial at Accra, did not seem calculated to give us a more favourable opinion than before of the mode in which justice is administered in that portion of Her Majesty's dominions known as the Gold Coast Colony. We shall not now enter into details, but there were two things that especially struck us. One was, that if our information was correct, the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Woodcock, who was retained against Mr. Davies, did at some stages of the proceedings sit as Judge, in the absence of the Chief Justice, and as Judge give decisions in this case, in which he was also counsel and attorney. We may be wrong, but this is still our impression. The other was, that we could not understand how any subsequent dealings with the trust created when Mr. J. P. L. Davies espoused Miss Bonetta Forbes could so vitiate it as to lead to the forfeiture of the whole of the property originally settled on Mrs. Davies and her issue at the time of the marriage. We found that the Court did strip Mrs. Davies of every portion of property thus settled upon her, and the poor lady was so affected by this decision and subsequent proceedings against her husband, that, being sent by medical order to Madeira, she died there of what may be designated as a broken heart; a death that has produced a great sensation in Lagos, where she was greatly esteemed and beloved. We did not forget that Her Most Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria, whose protégé Miss Bonetta Forbes was, would not consent to her marriage with Mr. Davies until the settlements above mentioned were effected. The marriage took place in or about 1863. And we could not and cannot at present conceive how mercantile transactions of Mr. J. P. L. Davies, the husband, between 1872 and 1875 or 1876, could so vitiate that original trust as to lead to a forfeiture in favour of Mr. Davies' creditors of 1872 forward. Mr. Davies writes to us in great bitterness of heart, and we are not surprised at this state of feeling on his part. He has sent us the affidavit, which will be found on another page, and as we shall certainly examine this case fully, so far as our limited space will permit, if the proper materials be furnished to us, we do not hesitate to give it insertion; although, whatever may have been the secret designs of those who sent him to Accra for trial, we must congratulate him on having been tried there instead of at Lagos, as no one can now say he was acquitted by a partial jury of his townsmen. This, however, does not at all touch the question of the justice of sending him there. The entire proceedings form a sad chapter in the commercial and legal history of Lagos. Anything that seems to us to throw discredit on the administration of justice in British Courts on the West Coast of Africa deeply moves us; the columns of the *African Times* during twenty years clearly show this. Our insistence is, that British Courts should be above suspicion."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**"", 'last_edit_date': '1868-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Past, Present, and Future', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In addition to our letters on passing events in the West African settlements, we have thought it our duty at this time to lay before the Right Hon. the Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies our view as regards the past, present, and future of those settlements; with the wants, wishes, and just claims of their native people. We beg the particular attention of our readers also to the contents of the letter above alluded to, a copy of which will be found on p. 113. It is not our purpose here to make any remarks on those contents, but we hope and believe that we have stated the case of the West African settlements and their people clearly and faithfully, although necessarily with much brevity. The space occupied in our columns by that letter will in this present number abridge the usually reserved by us for leaders; and force us to postpone the consideration of several topics now ripe and calling for remark. But it seems to us that there is at this time a crisis in West African affairs, which may eventuate in great good or prolonged evil, in proportion as wise counsels have sway with governors and people; and that all possible exertion on our part is required in order that the good may be inaugurated, and the evil dispersed. Our African readers will do well at the same time to bear in mind that a heavy duty and responsibility weighs on them, as well as on those to whom God has given the supreme rule over them. The conduct of a government will be more or less shaped by the more or less persistent and intelligent interest shown by the people in public affairs; by the more or less persistent demand on their part for measures and privileges to which an advancing people is justly entitled; and which are requisite as a stimulus to further progress. We use our best efforts for the people of the West African settlements; but we cannot do everything for them. Their co-operation is indispensable for obtaining measures, concessions, and even rights to which they have a just claim. Some of our friends at Cape Coast have of late been doing their duty nobly, with enlightened zeal and firmness, tempered by modesty and discretion. We hope those in other settlements will profit by the example. Sierra Leone would not then be content to sit in disgraceful apathy without any one of the grievances of which she many times complained having been redressed; without having made a single step forward towards financial self-government; without the removal of an officially condemned judge; without the re-establishment of that trial by jury which is as indispensable in civil as it is in criminal cases, if all classes of the people are to have protection against oppression and wrong. We were present at the sittings of the West African Parliamentary Committee (House of Commons Committee)—we heard the evidence as to alleged abuse of the right of trial by jury in civil causes—we have examined and re-examined that evidence, as well as the official letters of the great conspirators against the African people in this important matter—Blackall, Huggins, and Carr—and we do not hesitate to affirm not only that no sufficient ground for the confiscation of trial by jury was shown, but also that never, so far as we can historically remember, was a people deprived of an important civil right on such meagre suspicions and inconclusive evidence.

840,The imposition of British legal systems in Sierra Leone created legal ambiguities and challenges by conflicting with local customs and inconsistently applying reforms.,"The imposition of British legal systems in Sierra Leone created significant legal ambiguities and challenges, as evidenced by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the introduction of European judicial institutions, which, despite some attention to African customary law, resulted in conflicts with local customs. This is exemplified by the British attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement, where civil litigation involving Africans adhered to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law involving Europeans fell under colonial jurisdiction, underscoring the legal ambiguities. The Hut Tax rebellion of 1898 further illustrates the resistance and challenges faced due to these legal impositions. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the inconsistent application of reforms. In contrast, The African Times articles provide additional insights into these inconsistencies, such as the case of Cohen, where the defense's reliance on local customs was rejected by the court, highlighting the conflict between British law and local customs. The articles also discuss dissatisfaction with the administration of justice, including lengthy court delays, the absence of jury trials, and the financial burden of legal appeals to the Privy Council. The petition to the Colonial Office for the restoration of jury trials and local representation in the Legislative Council further illustrates the challenges and dissatisfaction with British legal reforms. Collectively, these sources demonstrate the conflicts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies introduced by the British legal system in Sierra Leone.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the imposition of British legal systems in Sierra Leone and the resulting legal ambiguities and challenges. The text mentions the introduction of European judicial institutions with some attention to African customary law, but notes that the effects were still modificatory, indicating a conflict with local customs. The British attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement, where civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law involving Europeans fell under colonial jurisdiction, further supports the claim of legal ambiguities. Additionally, the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898 in Sierra Leone, which was partly a response to the imposition of taxes and colonial rule, highlights the challenges and resistance faced due to these legal impositions. However, the text does not explicitly discuss the inconsistent application of reforms, which is a difference from the claim. Overall, the textbook provides evidence of conflicts with local customs and legal ambiguities but lacks specific details on inconsistent reform applications.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the imposition of British legal systems in Sierra Leone created legal ambiguities and challenges.

The court's ruling against this defense point underscores the legal ambiguities arising from the imposition of British law. Additionally, the articles mention the dissatisfaction with the administration of justice, such as the lengthy delays in court proceedings and the lack of jury trials, which were seen as inconsistent with the local needs and customs. The petition to the Colonial Office for the restoration of jury trials and the ability for locals to elect their representatives to the Legislative Council further illustrates the challenges and dissatisfaction with the British legal reforms. Moreover, the articles discuss the financial burden of legal appeals to the Privy Council and the lack of local control over public expenditure, which exacerbated the challenges faced by the local population.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

They were joined by the Mende people thereby involving almost three-quarters of the Protectorate. The rebel forces attacked and looted trading stations and killed British officials and troops and all those suspected of assisting the colonial government. As one district commissioner reported in April 1898, 'The object appears to be the massacre of all Sierra Leoneans (i.e. the Creoles of Freetown) and Europeans and thoroughly it is being done.

The British governor of Sierra Leone, who was stunned by the rebellion, attributed not only that rebellion but the general resistance to colonial rule that was raging at the time to 'the growing political consciousness of the African, and his increasing sense of his worth and autonomy'. As he put it, 'the native is beginning to feel his strength from the value that is set on him for the products of his country and his labour by the white man and in future the latter will not be able to trade so much on his simplicity and ignorance of the world as in the past'.$^{63}$ Governor Cardew's analysis cannot be faulted and is equally true of most of the rebellions and guerrilla wars that occurred in West Africa between the late 1890s and 1914."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': ""The first generation had coped with the problems of creating a viable new society from scratch.

Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade.

But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed. Though religious syncretism was not achieved, at any rate Christianity, traditional African religions and Islam co-existed at close quarters."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""Maclean's career3 blossomed after the new retreat of the British govern¬ ment, which, caught up between its embarrassing allies on the coast and the fighting spirit of Asante, felt that the Gold Coast was too expensive in terms of money and human lives despite the British victory at Dodowa.

She stated on oath that the town of Gondomah was taken at about seven o'clock on Friday morning, the 11th day of March last; that the war party remained in the town till the following Monday, the 14th, when they evacuated the place, taking along with them their prisoners; that they crossed the river which this witness seems to have regarded as one of the boundaries between the British and native territories, and after getting to a war-fence or country fortification, far away from the river in the bush, which she stated positively was not in British territory, the prisoner put Patience Peters to death.""}, {'id': 4281, 'article_title': 'THE IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT ""ORDINANCE"" AND TRADE IN THE RIVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT ""ORDINANCE"" AND TRADE IN THE RIVER.', 'last_edit_date': '07-28-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1881#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_09_1881', 'content': '*If the Debtors\' Ordinance of June, 1873, contemplated the passing of a Bankruptcy Ordinance, why has not one been passed? and what has become of the one drafted at Sierra Leone for this settlement by the Queen\'s Advocate?*  \n**JUNIUS.**\n\n---\n\n**TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.**  \nBathurst, River Gambia, 28th June, 1881.\n\nDear Sir,—To confirm my letter of the 5th May, 1881, I beg to state that for your information you will find herewith a copy of the Ordinance; please read and have same sent to the Secretary of State for perusal.

The *Times\'* special correspondent at Sierra Leone is doing good service.

If all the natives of that colony were to join our enemies, the Ashantis, in disgust at English injustice, it ought not to cause us the smallest surprise. Our courts of law in Freetown—if the facts be as described—are merely stages whereon justice is made into a cruel farce. The lawyers of the colony, it seems, have so far forgotten what is due to their honourable profession as universally to accept retaining fees of 10l. annually from the leading firms and wealthier residents in the place, engaging themselves not to appear against them in any action. The consequence, of course, is that when a native desires to sue one of these firms or individuals, he finds not a single counsel free to undertake his case. And further, the negro, if he attempts to fight his own cause in the court, is immediately met by a demurrer to set aside his motion as irregularly brought forward, and he is left wholly without redress. We find it very hard to believe that the boasted English love of justice and fair-play has ended in such a *fiasco* as this, and that the judges and lawyers, and the whole English society of Sierra Leone have not been ashamed to permit it for an hour.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-09-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_09_1873#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters. The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I met in St. Louis an English-born Freetown negress who told me that, having a dispute about property in Freetown, she had gone to law there.

The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like.

Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security.

Taylor, Laughland, & Co., of Glasgow, the reputed owners of Matacong, to take possession of the island, put the buildings in repair, and to prepare part of the land for the cultivation of indigo, the remainder to be used as grazing ground. Mr. Smith arrived in due course, accompanied by a native as his assistant. After taking possession he commenced to repair the buildings on the island, hoisting the British flag. A few days later a small French Government paddle-boat came to the island. The captain came on shore and chastised a number of natives living on the island. Mr. Smith remonstrated with the French authorities, but was told to mind his own business or he would be treated similarly. Before leaving the island, the captain informed Mr. Smith that he was going to the French Governor for the Northern Rivers for instructions, and would return, upon which Mr. Smith informed him that he would wait four days, after which he had to leave for Sierra Leone on private business. He waited four days, and not seeing anything further of them left for Sierra Leone. About fifteen miles from Matacong, on his way to Freetown, he saw the French gunboat, apparently making for the island. Under the circumstances he thought it best to return. He arrived on the island perhaps half an hour after the landing of the French officer, when he found his assistant tied up and the British flag torn down. He protested against this, stating that Matacong was British, and that the French Government had no authority there whatever. Upon this Mr. Smith was arrested also, and taken by the gunboat on to Konakeri (better known as Isles de Los). He was there handed over to the French Commandant, and, after being kept for nineteen hours was told that he could go. He then laid the matter before the Administrator at Sierra Leone.""\n\nIt is now stated officially that Matacong, is not in any way under the protection of England. The reported insult to Mr. Smith is not seriously regarded, as he had no authority to hoist the flag. The island, though it became British property in 1826, was, it seems, ceded to France in 1879, and in 1882, although the treaty was not then ratified, it came under French control. In 1889 an agreement was signed with France handing over the island to that country. Major Crooks, Acting Governor of Sierra Leone, has not yet reported the occurrence to the Foreign Office.

As might be expected no small portion of the episcopal address deals with the new Constitution of the Church which was promulgated. The Bishop points out this Constitution was adopted by representative members of the local Church, and was accepted by the three great authorities to whom they look for counsel and advice—the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the great Church Missionary Society. He then alludes to the case of those quondam pastors who will not accept the new Constitution, but at the same time decline frankly to leave the positions to which they have no longer a shadow of right, and refuse to vacate the parsonage-houses, &c., to which possession was given them on condition of their working in obedience to their Bishop and other constituted authorities. The Bishop then goes on to detail the difficulties of the position, and the steps which he, in conjunction with the Church Missionary Society, has felt bound to take up with regard to these recalcitrant brethren. Of course the question of the legal possession of the parsonages and glebes is one for the civil courts; and the Church Missionary Society can be trusted to see that ""justice be done."" Then, with regard to the ecclesiastical position, the Bishop observes: ""What is the line we take as to [ecclesiastical] administration? Until we are given back the properties by the Church Missionary Society we decided not to approach the good people of these villages in any form or shape; they are, for the time being, outside the Church administration, and, painful though the exile is to me as Bishop, I am certain it is less disturbing to innocent and inoffending people living there than any active intervention on my part would be. And what of the ex-Pastors? We say, with no uncertain voice, that nothing can alter the ecclesiastical situation, whatever be the delays and uncertainties of the law about the property. We cannot, and we will not, recognise as pastors of the little society known as the Sierra Leone Church any who repudiate and refuse to be governed by her Constitution.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

The emergent labour force gradually became unionized in many colonies and added momentum to the expression of African nationalism through anti-colonial politics. As labour in the colonies exhibited all the malaise of a colonial situation, especially harsh exploitation based on racial discrimination and social injustice, labour relations automatically became political relations which were antagonistic as between the citizens of the colonizing country and the colonized Africans. The role of labour in the politics of African nationalism was to become very important from the Second World War onwards. 7\nThe role of the different official ideologies enunciated by the colonial powers was another determinant. As John Peel says 'An ideology, like the ideals of the great religions, is a factor shaping behaviour even when uncompletely realised ...' and 'Development does not occur apart from men's interpretation of their situation and ideas for their future.'$^{8}$ The differences in the orientation and style of African nationalists derived in part from the fact that the various groups had different ideologies to guide their expectations and by which to assess their achievements. Hence, among African nationalists under French control in Algeria and Senegal, where the possibility of ending colonialism through the policy of'assimila› tion' - by the attainment of French citizenship for individuals with full rights and responsibilities - had been demonstrated, the tendency was to continue to press for the extension, in scope and territorially, of the implementation of the policy. On the other hand, those in British territories, with the hope of eventual independence as separate sovereign countries, though as members of the British Commonwealth, were understandably more explicitly concerned during the period under consideration with reforms and participation which would prepare them ultimately for independence. The difference was not as to the objective of freedom, which they all wanted, but rather as to method.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials.

The constitutional situation made it possible for Sa'd ZaghlüPs Wafd Party and the Nationalist Party to play a very important role in the struggle for the restoration of full independence and sovereignty to Egypt.$^{13}$ The introduction of constitutional changes, though of less importance, in Nigeria and the Gold Coast in British West Africa, paved the way for the appearance and meaningful operation of political parties. Before such constitutional changes, the National Congress of British West Africa had been easily checkmated in its endeavours.$^{14}$ Thereafter the National Democratic Party of Nigeria was, for instance, able to make a more sustained impact on both the colonial authorities and the indigenous population. So also did political parties play important roles in Senegal where the General Council which, after 1920, became the Colonial Council, provided the forum.\nYouth organizations, ethnic associations, old boys' associations and other movements dedicated to the achievement of civil liberties and the rights of man fulfilled an invaluable role in all the colonies irrespective of their constitutional situations. They were an unavoidable political and social force especially in areas where overt political activities were made impossible by the repressive nature of colonial rule. Youth organizations which acted as catalysts in the nationalist, anti-colonial politics and whose activities will be discussed in Chapter 25 below, included the Gold Coast Youth Conference which was founded in 1929; the Lagos (later Nigeria) Youth Movement, Young Egypt, Harry Thuku's Young Kikuyu Association founded in Kenya in 1921, the Sudan Graduates' Congress, the Young Gabonese (Jeune Gabonais), and Young Tunisians. Some of the move› ments were inter-regional while others were trans-territorial. The former included the North African Star under the leadership of Messali Hadj, the National Congress of British West Africa, the South Africa Congress and the West African Students' Union led by the Nigerian, Ladipo Solanke, which drew its membership from all of British West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In parts of Africa, especially among such chiefless peoples as the Igbo, Ibibio, Ogoja, Tiv, Idoma, Birom, Angas and Gwari of Nigeria where it was difficult to identify the traditional rulers and associate them with the work of the colonial government, many members of the new elite came from among those who in pre-colonial times would have been classified as commoners. Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them. In the nineteenth-century Gold Coast and in Yorubaland (Nigeria), many of the founding members of the new elite group were - or at least believed they were - related by blood to the peoples of the interior.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Political activities in Francophone West Africa, 1919-35 > Politics and nationalism in Senegal', 'content': ""Perhaps the two most interesting French West African colonies where there was some African political activity in the inter-war period are Senegal and Dahomey.

This was the Republican Socialist Party, which he founded in 1914 to unite the various ethnic groups in Dakar and St-Louis. Diagne, after almost twenty years' absence from Senegal, offered himself as a candidate in 1914, at a time when more Senegalese were coming into the urban areas and the groundnut economy was developing. This was also a time when, with the political demise of the traditional chiefs, the marabouts (leaders of Islamic orders) were becoming a new political and social force in the rural areas. Young Senegalese clerks and school teachers in the urban areas were also becoming restive.

Between 1816 and 1823 the impetus came from the Governor, Sir Charles MacCarthy, an administrator and builder with the soul of a missionary. The continual growth of the population, and its eagerness to put down roots, made improvement of the amenities impera› tive. As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade. The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed.

In a sense, the orientations of African leadership elites were shaped partly by the form of colonial administration. Where the administra› tions were regional in structure and/or policy, as in the French colonial federations, the African leaders tended to adopt a regional outlook. Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism. Probably an accurate word for this phenomenon in Africa - as E. S. Atieno-Odhiambo shows in Chapter 26 - is the Swahili word siasa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Improvement associations and trade unionism', 'content': ""Of minor political significance during this period were the many com› mercial associations formed by the African farmers and businessmen.

Their daily activities thus became a matter of contest between the mass leadership and the local representatives of the colonial administration. A case in point was the Kilimanjaro Native Planters (Coffee) Association (KNPA) which was founded in 1925 'to protect and promote the interests of the Native Coffee Growers on the mountain'. 24 Partly as a result of the fears of European settlers about organized African lobbying, and also as a result of the personality clashes between the leader, Joseph Merinyo, and the various British administrative officials and African chiefs, this organization found itself pushed to take up other matters like land registration, land alienation and use, closer union with Kenya, political rights, and representation in the Central Legislative Council and the Moshi District Water Board. At the local level, the posture the union took often appeared calculated to oppose chiefly authority. This was in fact the case, and in this respect it was similar to the many local protest movements in East Africa in the mid-1920s.

By 1827, however, an embryonic development process had started. The main emphasis was laid, at first, on the production of food, and especially of rice, but efforts were also directed towards the cultivation of export crops and the exploitation of local natural resources: in the first category there were sugar, ginger and indigo, and in the second there were coffee and exotic timber. An indigenous variety of coffee had been discovered in the early days of the settlement and was cultivated sys› tematically. In 1835, this was beginning to provide an economic argument for allocating more funds for putting an end to the peripheral Rio Nunez or Gallinas slave trade: in just eighteen months, a trading house in London had received almost 65 000 kg of coffee, which confirmed the need to protect the people engaged in growing and marketing the crop. Sierra Leonean companies established for the purpose of exporting timber, especially a variety of teak, were beginning to prosper. Here again, the main interest lay in the creation of a reliable economic substitute for the slave trade: in 1824 fifty Western ships loaded 200000 dollars' worth of timber in the Sierra Leone estuary.$^{38}$ Favourable conditions combined to create a certain amount of wealth (it can hardly be described as capital) within the colony. Its ships began to ply the waters along the West African coast as far as the Bight of Biafra. Foreign ships were thenceforth able to put in safely to ports in the estuary for the purpose of the legitimate trade so earnestly desired by the abolitionists. However, the significance of this 'take-off' should not be exaggerated: it simply showed that the experiment was viable, with a minimum of administrative support from the European metropolis.\nAll things considered, the British government's action in 1853 in making the Sierra Leoneans subjects of the Crown represented implicit recognition of the fact that a heterogeneous medley of cultures had been welded together into a viable Creole society. A 'civilized' nation had been created not according to some Utopian European model but by the strength of its own genius.$^{39}$ The part that was obviously played by the British antislavery movement left intact the character of an African solution."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

I did my best to oppose such cession then.

Some time after other questions caused such divergence of opinion between the old members of the Native Association—men of property and position in Bathurst—and their younger countrymen, that the Association was dissolved. In 1876 I ascended the Gambia to about thirty miles above Barracoonda Rapids. I then proposed that trade should be opened from the head waters of this river to Sego, on the Niger, and with that scheme in view I remained in Gambia. I soon found that it would take time and much capital to organize such plans, and that to gain a proper knowledge of the people and the commerce of this part of North-West Africa was essential. I therefore went into the River trade, which, from the reasons I have already mentioned, has been a losing affair. However, had I been successful in opening trade to Sego, such loss would not have mattered. In 1879 I went to London, and, having got some capitalists there to adopt the scheme of trade from Gambia with the Upper Niger, starting from a depot at Yarbutenda, on the Upper Gambia, I laid the matter before the Secretary for the Colonies, asking no concession beyond free imports and exports at Yarbutenda for ten years, and that the Government would prevent foreign competition with our trade for that time. This was, in the end, refused. Had the Colonial officer granted to us then the tenth part of the privileges lately granted by Royal Charter by the Foreign Office to the recently incorporated North Borneo Company, trade would have been now well established with Sego, the French would have been forestalled in that city and the Upper Niger, the Galleini Treaty would never have been written, the new French posts of Bafoulabe and Kita would not have been built, England would have had a commercial treaty with the King of...\n**27**'}]","[{'document_title': 'Another Petition for a Better Administration of the Law in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Another very important subject to which the attention of your lordship is earnestly solicited is the present constitution of the Legislative Council of this settlement.

I fear no contradiction by saying that none of the European or West Indian officials come to the coast of Africa for the love of civilisation, or for the improvement of that country, nor would it be reasonable to suppose such a hypothesis. It is a well-known fact that no love of Africa brought them there. Who ought therefore to be the best judge of what is good for a country? the foreign official who considers Africa as a means of earning his salary with a view to leave after a few years on half-pay, or perhaps a pension, or the individual who belongs to the soil, to which only he can look for his own improvement and social elevation? Much has been said against the introduction of a partially self-governing principle in the colony; and the stereotyped argument has been, ""Africans are not ripe yet for self-government;"" which, not being based upon the fact of experiment, but simply on supposition, will no doubt be used until Africans prove the contrary—a circumstance which, under the present system, would be rather difficult.\n\nI am personally acquainted with numerous liberated Africans who were landed at Sierra Leone from the captured slave-ships;—several of them within my own knowledge—in a perfect state of nudity. Of these there are a great many who, at present, live in decent houses, and are well to do; several standing at the head of, for the colony, important houses of business, and enjoying a credit from English merchants. All these men knew how to make their position literally from nothing, and know how to maintain it; is it not therefore reasonable to suppose that they would be able to assist practically in the Legislature? They certainly know as well what is good for their country as any of the present members of the Legislature. A very handsome revenue, quite sufficient to meet the present expenditure, is collected in the colony; but, under the control of people who are the principal contributors, the expenditure is capable of being very considerably and favourably modified, which would soon be followed by a reduction of the house and land-tax, which presses somewhat heavily upon the poor.\n\nI do not mean to say that the first session of a legislative body elected or selected from the people of Sierra Leone would be perfect; nay, I will admit even that its first discussions would perhaps force smiles from veteran councillors; but I am quite confident that gradually the proper element would come into the Legislature, and that prosperity to the colony and the surrounding country would emanate from it.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'APPOINTMENT OF A NATIVE TO BE A MEMBER OF COUNCIL', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—We have been informed that, with a view to strengthen the Legislative Council, and secure the representation of native interests, your Excellency has been pleased to nominate a native gentleman for appointment to the Council.\n\nWe feel extremely gratified that your Excellency has recognized the importance of introducing the native element into the Council—an experiment which has been tried for many years past in the sister colony of Sierra Leone with most satisfactory results, and we venture to anticipate a similar success to the scheme in this settlement.\n\nOn behalf of ourselves and the community in general, we beg leave respectfully to convey to your Excellency our cordial thanks for this proposed scheme, which we welcome as a further proof of your Excellency's concern for the material welfare of all classes of the community, and as a compliment to the growing intelligence of the native inhabitants.\n\nWe rejoice further to learn that your choice for nomination has fallen upon Mr. Joseph D.

In local politics there is great activity, the Legislative Council being in full session. This has caused great excitement among the inhabitants. It appears that by order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies an Ordinance is to be passed giving the town a Municipality. Besides this, the Estimates for 1891 are about to be passed, a larger revenue is required, and a new tariff will probably be promulgated, which will come in force in January.\n\nThe Municipality Ordinance is strongly opposed in its present shape by all the inhabitants. It is considered merely a device to re-impose the house and land tax, repealed since 1872. A Commission has been nominated, consisting of the Queen's Advocate, the Colonial Treasurer, Mr. Samuel Lewis, and Mr. T. J. Sawyer, the two latter unofficial members of the Legislative Council, to frame an amended Ordinance, containing more liberal provisions, especially with reference to the powers to be given to the town councillors. This Colony has been a Crown Colony over a hundred years, and the people think it time they should be allowed some voice in the expenditure of the revenue. They say the Municipality must be on such lines as will make it a reality, for as the draft stands it merely appears to create a Government Department, in which the Governor and his nominees are supreme. A well-digested scheme would probably not be opposed, for it would only be a tentative measure, until finally the Colony would become self-governing.\n\nThe Estimates for 1890 have been well maintained, and a fair surplus will be available at the end of the year. But a larger revenue is required for carrying on the frontier policy. More money is also wanted for education, public roads, bridges, and buildings, a subsidy for steam communication between Freetown and other parts of the Colony for the conveyance of fruits, and other objects now neglected for want of funds. Especially, money is required to be spent in Sherbro' to build Government offices at Bradoo, which is the most healthy part of Sherbro'. The new Customs tariff must be better adapted than the old one to the position the Colony holds as regards trade with the surrounding countries. The fiscal laws in the French territories are on a different basis. No import duty is charged by them; only an export duty of 7½ per cent. on all produce. In consequence, all trade goes in preference to their part of the coast, while the British stations are neglected.

That your petitioners are inhabitants of the Settlement of Sierra Leone on the West Coast of Africa, and having during the past two or three years regarded with sadness the increasing depression of trade which is the mainstay of the Colonial Revenue, now humbly ask leave to lay before your lordship the straitened condition of the Settlement, with a suggestion of what appears to your lordship's petitioners to be a remedy for the evils of which they complain.  \n2. That although, according to the present Charter of Constitution, Sierra Leone theoretically embraces all Her Majesty's possessions comprised between the fifth and twelfth degrees of north latitude, and lying to the westward of the tenth degree of west longitude, it, in point of fact, includes only the peninsula of Sierra Leone which is about eighteen miles long and twelve miles broad and the district of Sherbro acquired by cession in the year 1862.  \n3. That whatever may be conjectured of the agricultural aptness of Sierra Leone, it cannot be gainsaid that the special capabilities of the Settlement have betrayed themselves strongly in favour of trade; and that its capacity for rapid development as a commercial community is evidenced by the fact that whereas in 1864 the imports amounted to 190,441l., the exports 201,808l., and the revenue, collected chiefly upon merchandise, 48,692l.; in 1871 the imports increased to 305,849l., the exports 467,755l., and the revenue 80,406l.  \n4. That a small proportion only of the imports of the Settlement is consumed within it; and that the greater bulk is carried into the interior countries by the adjacent native tribes who until lately have from the countries lying along the Melicourie and Scarcies Rivers on the north, and between Calmont Creek and the Bargroo River on the south, numerously resorted to the Settlement and made there large sales and purchases.  \n5. That the amount of trade, until lately, carried on within Sierra Leone itself by the adjacent native tribes occupying the place of intermediaries between the Settlement and the interior countries, was so considerable as to afford not only an ample field for the commercial operations of the general community of merchants and traders, but also a sensible support to the colonial revenue.  \n6. That your lordship's petitioners sincerely believe that the acquisition of, at least, the seaboard of those adjacent native territories at the proper time would have secured the Sierra Leone trade and revenue from the fluctuation and peril to which both seem at the present time to be exposed. That with the perception of the advantages that would have been so secured, recommendations had been made about eleven years ago to the then Governor of Sierra Leone by an influential body of the inhabitants of the Settlement, to accept a cession of some of the territories in Melicourie which were then offered by the native Princes to, but refused by, the Sierra Leone Government.  \n7. That this refusal to accept the cession was shortly followed by the French taking possession of those territories, which with others had become so important to the general welfare of Sierra Leone, that Sir Arthur Kennedy during his Governorship advised Her Majesty's Government to acquire them from the French, even at the expense of the British Settlements on the Gambia.  \n8. That since the inauguration of the New Tariff in 1872, whereby the duties on spirits and tobacco were increased, a disposition to evade those duties has been manifested by the native tribes who are the principal consumers, and been very largely gratified by the establishment of factories along the small and great Scarcies Rivers on the north, and between the Calmont Creek and Bargroo on the south, from which the goods being there free from duties, can be procured at a cheaper rate than in Sierra Leone, and often in the case of the Scarcies, smuggled through British waters to Port Lokkoh and other native dominions, to which the easiest access is by water through the Sierra Leone River.  \n9. That respecting the Scarcies, your petitioners would further state that even if a vigilant and effective Water Police could be appointed to guard against smuggling by native canoes coming from the north through the Sierra Leone River, the overland communication between the Scarcies and Port Lokkoh Rivers is so comparatively easy, that the activity of the police would most probably result in entirely driving the trade from Sierra Leone into channels over which the British Government can exercise no control.  \n10. That owing to the advantages offered for the evasion of and exemption from the duties, the large number of native traders who formerly came here to trade, now stay away from the Settlement; and that the consequence has been that little business is done in Sierra Leone in comparison to the trade of former years, and there has been a necessity for the local Legislature to employ various devices—by the taxation of exports and otherwise—to raise a sinking revenue.  \n11. That even a great proportion of the articles of export could have found their way direct from the Scarcies and some of the other producing centres to the markets for which they are ultimately intended, but for the shipping which is more easily obtained at Sierra Leone.  \n12. That your lordship's petitioners would crave leave further to assert their belief that whatever difficulties may oppose the transfer of the Melicourie territories already occupied by the French, are not likely to interpose themselves, with respect to the Scarcies whose chiefs and princes in 1872, when they were visited by Governor Pope Hennessy, expressed their entire concurrence to cede their territories to the British Crown. And your lordship's petitioners also firmly believe that the chiefs whose territories divide the peninsula of Sierra Leone from British Sherbro, will be found to yield to negotiations for a cession of their territories.  \n13. That your lordship's petitioners are convinced that the acquisition of the territories above mentioned will not only secure a prosperous development of the Sierra Leone trade, but will enable the Government even upon reduction of existing duties to procure a revenue ample for all the wants of the Settlement, and especially for meeting the sanitary and other improvements urgently needed, but at present sadly neglected for want of funds. Nor have your petitioners lost sight of the beneficial influence which British possession of those territories will have for the spread in Africa of religion, civilization, and commerce, hitherto considerably retarded in this part of Africa by continuous petty native feuds, to which, nevertheless, as your petitioners sincerely believe, the acquisition of the lands by the British Crown will put an end.  \nYour lordship's petitioners therefore humbly pray that your lordship will be pleased to recommend to Her Majesty's Government the acquisition, either by purchase or by treaty engagements, of the native dominions from the Scarcies Rivers on the north to the Bargroo River on the south of the peninsula of Sierra Leone.  \nAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.  \n(Here follow a large number of signatures)."", 'last_edit_date': '1875-08-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like. The revenue of the protectorate is derived from licenses and a house tax. The staff in each district consists of a District Commissioner, surgeon, and company of frontier police. Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security. The effect of the further establishment of British administration and tribunals has been the movement of a number of Natives from the coast into the interior with the purpose of trading, and there is therefore every hope of an increasing development of the natural products of the protectorate in the near future.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sierra Leone and Its People', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following interesting account is extracted from one of a series of articles at present appearing in the *Manchester Examiner*, under the heading of ""Leaves from a Traveller’s Note-book"":—\n\nSierra Leone, our most flourishing colony on the West African Coast, owes its existence to the measures attending the suppression of the slave trade. There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of the Report of Col.

This has been done by treaties, which stipulate that the slave trade shall be abolished, that perfect freedom of trade shall be allowed in their countries, and their canoes permitted to come to our ports; that British subjects shall be protected, and if they commit offences, shall be sent to Sierra Leone for trial. In return they receive stipends varying from 5l. to 100l., and involving a total cost to the local Government of nearly 1,400l. a-year. It was urged by the Chamber of Commerce that this money was ill bestowed, but this is not established on inquiry. No doubt some of the treaties are with chiefs whose influence has greatly diminished since they were entered into; and, as no provision was made for such a contingency, there may be a few cases out of the whole seventy-nine in which the stipend is paid without an adequate return.\n\nIn the majority of instances, however, this is not the case; the treaties are generally faithfully observed, and, where they are broken by the people, it is found that a threat of withdrawing his subsidy has generally the effect of inducing the chief to compel the offenders to make restitution.\n\nIt is unquestionable that by means of these treaties the Sierra Leone Government exercises an influence over a large extent of country from which it would otherwise be excluded—an influence which is most useful in securing the safety of its trade and the protection of its people, as well as enabling it to interfere on occasions between the natives themselves, not only greatly to their advantage, but often for the security and peace of the settlement.\n\nThe slave-trade, understanding thereby the export of slaves to America, is unknown in Sierra Leone; but as domestic slavery exists in every part of the continent not under British rule, it has constantly happened that the natives, whilst engaged in transporting purchased or kidnapped slaves from one part of the country to another, find they have brought themselves within the reach of British authority, which at once restores their slaves to liberty."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Proposed Light Railway for Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Tuesday, March 7, Surgeon-Major Lamprey, Army Medical Staff of the Sierra Leone Delimitation Commission, read a paper on this subject before the African section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce.

The convict\'s present work is not absolutely necessary, as the roads were in former years kept quite as clean by the compulsory labour of one week by every inhabitant. The greatest requirement of the colony is agriculture; and I firmly believe that it could not be more advantageously introduced than through the establishment of a model farm by convict labour. At present the characteristic feature of the inmates of the gaol is to make that institution a kind of refuge; availing themselves of ""the temporary leave of absence,"" they go out, but invariably soon return, on account of being worthless for honest employment. In a model farm they would first work to maintain themselves, and, secondly, become acquainted with agriculture, which might induce many to remove to parts where they are not known and endeavour to regain an honest position in life. The expense of one could scarcely be more than the amount which the establishment of the colonial gaol now costs, and the farm would very soon become self-supporting.

Manchester woven goods and cotton have scarcely found their way there and where an article is offered which meets a felt want, it is surprising how quickly the Natives acquire it.

Another means for the development of the resources of the country would be the settlement of Natives with capital from Sierra Leone and elsewhere, who would carry on such kinds of agriculture. The aborigines live only for the present; they cannot see the force of cultivating plants such as the coffee for the fruits of which they must wait for four or more years.

The General History of Africa suggests that colonial administrations often relied on indirect rule, utilizing indigenous institutions and personnel in subordinate roles due to the continent's vastness and limited European personnel. This approach was more focused on maintaining control and ensuring economic profitability rather than implementing meaningful legislative reforms. Efforts to introduce new judicial systems and bureaucracies were primarily aimed at facilitating colonial control, with measures like European-planned taxes and forced labor being disruptive rather than reformative. This indicates a primary concern with authority and economic exploitation over legislative reforms for African societies' benefit. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by highlighting concerns about the slave trade's suppression and the need for stronger governance in Western Africa, including appointing a responsible agent to represent African colonies in Britain. The articles emphasize the importance of maintaining settlements to prevent the slave trade's resurgence and call for improved administrative arrangements and infrastructure development, such as a railway from Lagos, to enhance trade and commerce. These points suggest a belief in the necessity of a stronger presence and legislative reforms, although criticisms of the colonial administration's failures indicate that while the belief existed, implementation was often lacking or problematic. Together, these sources reveal a nuanced view of colonial intentions and actions, reflecting varied approaches and priorities in colonial rule.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that both support and refute the claim that colonial administrations believed in establishing a stronger presence and implementing significant legislative reforms to address issues in African colonies.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Certainly in some areas stable administrations apparently resulted in increasing populations in the nineteenth century, such as apparently occurred in Egypt from early in the century as Muhammad$^{ c}$Alî extended irrigation and sanitation$^{53}$ and in Algeria after the French subjugated all opposition in 1879.$^{54}$ The necessity for such stability, especially as civilian instead of military administration became the rule around the turn of the century, arose out of the metropolitan powers' demand that their colonial administrations in Africa should be financially self-supporting.$^{55}$ Hence the increasing concentration on communications and export production.\nPerhaps the major demographic problem in the years up to the First World War centres on the so-called 'labour question' and on the conces› sionaire schemes of Middle Africa.\nIn the late nineteenth century it was the central belief of colonizers that colonies should be profitable. Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

The Gambia and Gold Coast have not, however, these claims to consideration, and whilst of the latter it has been already shown that the withdrawal of the British authorities would probably be the signal for the re-opening of the slave trade, it is impossible to predict a better fate for the Gambia; the religious and other wars constantly prevailing there between the natives lead to the capture of large numbers of prisoners, of whom they are always anxious to dispose to one another, but whom they would be highly gratified to be able to sell for export beyond the seas, were the opportunity which our absence would afford once granted them, an opportunity which the free navigation of their fine river would place at the disposal of tribes far in the interior.\n\nIf, therefore, the slave trade is to be effectually and economically repressed, the settlements must be maintained; and it now remains to consider what improved arrangements should be introduced into their administration, with the view of securing their greater efficiency.\n\nOn reviewing the history of the settlements, the conclusion seems inevitable, that in respect to the three smaller, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos, whether as regards the state of their finances, their taxation, legislation, and the general management of their affairs,\n**165**\n\nThe present condition of each of them may be attributed in great measure to the want of a regular and well-defined system of administration.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553.

The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

The Conference, though purely consultative, and in no sense charged with the power either of legislating or of proposing legislation, was extremely interesting in many ways. It was the first occasion on which delegates from the possessions of the British Crown had met together officially commissioned to make known the wants and interests of the Colonies they represented. They spoke in the name of communities which fifty years ago were, some of them, in their infancy; and others, not many years since, were mere stretches of unoccupied land, but are now rich and thriving communities. It is not to be expected that the Conference will have immediate practical results, but should rather be regarded as an opportunity for the different Colonies to make themselves heard, and for the Imperial Government to put forth its own views on questions of finance and such like. Lord Salisbury, in his address on the opening day, dwelt almost exclusively on the need of some such Conference, as a means of discovering the weak places in the government of the Empire and strengthening them. It was to occupy itself primarily with the question of Colonial defence, since no amount of pacific intention can make vigilance unnecessary. Accordingly, much of the time of the Conference was occupied discussing a scheme of Colonial defence, though the ""summary statements"" of the self-governing Colonies on this important point are not printed in the Blue Books. The question of posts and telegraphs is argued from all sides, and considerable attention was devoted to the desirability of making the laws of the Mother Country and the Colonies work without mutual friction. Upon the question of defence, it must not be forgotten that the Colonies, for all their growth, are but thinly populated regions; and yet each has ready for emergency a considerable effective force, exclusive of the reserves. So far for local defence; but we are not so well informed as to the fortifications of coaling-stations, and the agreements entered into between the Imperial Government and the various Colonies to provide for colonial maritime security. Most satisfactory is the resolution to increase the Australasian Squadron for the protection of the floating trade; an arrangement being made to the effect that the Home Government undertakes to provide, under certain conditions as to finance, five fast cruisers and two torpedo gunboats for the exclusive use of the Colonies.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

As Angoulvant, who was appointed Governor of the Ivory Coast in August 1908, put it: What has to be established above all is the indisputable principle of our authority ... On the part of the natives, the acceptance of this principle must be expressed in a deferential welcome and absolute respect for our representatives whoever they may be, in the full payment of taxes at a uniform rate of 2.50 francs, in serious co› operation in the construction of tracks and roads, in the acceptance of paid porterage, in the following of our advice [sic] in regard to labour, in recourse to our justice ...

District commissioners and travelling commissioners were appointed, new courts were established, new codes and new laws were introduced, chiefs were confirmed or deposed and new ones appointed, direct and indirect taxation was introduced, and forced labour was demanded for the construction of roads and railways. All these measures naturally generated various reactions.\nDuring this second phase, while there were differences in the objectives in view, the strategy adopted for the attainment of these objectives by West Africans was the same. The main objectives were three: to regain their independence and sovereignty, which implied expelling the colonial rulers altogether; to seek to correct or redress certain specific abuses or oppressive aspects of the colonial system; or to seek accommodation within it. The strategy that was adopted during this phase was neither submission nor alliance but that of resistance and this took many forms: revolts or rebellions, migrations, strikes, boycotts, petitions and delegations and finally ideological protest. The leadership during this period also remained virtually the same as that between 1880 and 1900, that is mainly that of the traditional rulers.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

But by the mid-nineteenth century, Bell Town and Bimbia traders, working together, had begun to compete successfully though peacefully with the leading traders of the Rio del Rey.\nThe slaves who arrived at the coast in the 1840s, mostly captives from the Bali-Chamba raids in the Bamenda grasslands, represented a critical element in the transition of coastal societies from slave-trading to legitimate commerce. In the Cameroon river and Bimbia, as in Calabar and the Niger delta, slaves were used in producing palm oil and palm kernels and other commodities of legitimate commerce. At Bimbia and the Cameroon river, an important variation was the well-organized system by which Kings William and Bell hired out some of their slaves to the West African Company at Fernando Po. The system assumed the nature of indenture, and provided an additional source of wealth for both monarchs. But the system was open to abuses, and led to British parliamentary investigation.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation.

And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

Is it not, then, a most atrocious injustice that because this creature of Major Blackall, the ex-Governor, was made by him stipendiary police magistrate, that he should still be allowed to insult, in this capacity, the people of Sierra Leone, among whom there are so many men so far his superiors, morally and intellectually, that it would be an insult to them to institute any comparison between him and them? On what possible ground can it be justified that such a man as Major Bravo should be saddled on the Sierra Leone revenues for 600l. a-year, only to extend his sphere of mischief in the capacity of a magistrate, and to give him power to insult such men as Mr. Rainy with impunity, to bring the military into increased odium with the community at large, and the administration of justice into loathing and contempt. To retain such a man in such an office at Sierra Leone, is a most unjustifiable insult to the people, is disgraceful to the British Government, and a gross plunder of the colonial revenues. Then, again, look at the performance of magisterial duties at Cape Coast by Colonel Delamaine Mends. Is not this something at which every man in authority in the office in Downing-street ought to blush (page 128). Does it not exhibit that the system of the British Government in the West African settlements is a system of plunder, and nothing else. If the Acting Administrator has the power to dictate to the magistrate what warrant he shall or shall not grant, and what his decisions are to be, is it not a despicable thing that a man should consent to be such a tool; a discreditable farce that there should be such a magistrate to be paid out of the local revenues at the rate of a guinea per hour? If the Acting Administrator possesses such power, why is it not ordered that he shall himself sit as magistrate, and save to the settlement the pay of a magistrate. It would be much more fair for the Government to say at once to all persons residing there, ""You will please to observe that you are to live under an irresponsible despotism, and to have no will but that of the governor, and no redress for anything you may suffer from him."" Men would be able to understand this; but they cannot understand such a system as actually prevails, while being told at the same time that they are living under the protection of British laws. We are sorry to have to mention the name of Captain Russell, at Accra, in conjunction with two such military magisterial specimens as Major Bravo and Colonel Mends, because we have before heard much in his praise; but ""Roll him out"" is not the sort of language that will cause the Administrator or the administration of justice to be respected. As regards Cape Coast, we cannot understand the necessity of appointing such a man as Colonel Mends to the paid magistracy, while there is such a gentleman resident there as Mr. Francis Chapman Grant, the senior unpaid magistrate of Cape Coast, unless it be that there was a certain sum to be taken out of the colonial chest, and that Colonel Mends was as good a man as any other, regard being had to the overgorged official condition of Mr. Colonial-Surgeon (with eight or ten official etc.\'s) Thomas Jones, to effect the extraction.

It is true that at the Sherboro the colonial surgeon has three other appointments also; that another official has two, both with handsome salaries attached, &c., &c. But it is at the Gold Coast that these evils have become most prominent, and have been most compromising, as regards the British official character and the purity of administration; and the loading with incompatible offices a gentleman who, however talented and estimable he may be, was quite new to official life, necessarily challenged remark from us, as the only public organ that represents Africa with the British public, and Great Britain with the Africans.\n\nThat the offices thus accumulated could not be properly held by one and the same individual at any one time, will very clearly appear when we state that the holder of one of them cannot, while charged with its duties, sit in the Council, while the holder of another of them becomes, in virtue of the office, a prominent and influential member of that Council. While charged, therefore, with the offices we have enumerated, Mr. Barry is at the same time expressly enjoined to attend the Council, and expressly prohibited from doing so. And this is not all. There is something which in our eyes is far more serious. In the administration of justice it is of the very highest importance that there should be not only an absence of all bias on the part of the judge, but also an absence of everything that could afford even the slightest ground for an imputation of partiality or predecision. The judge should not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. What, then, can be urged in favour or excuse of an arrangement by which an individual is, in his capacity of Queen’s advocate, the public and official prosecutor, and sits also as judge, in his capacity as acting chief justice, for the trial of the very causes he has, as Queen’s advocate, promoted and undertaken to substantiate? Surely this is a most flagrant impropriety; and we cannot be surprised that observers should challenge the purity and impartiality of justice thus administered or maladministered. But as if this was insufficient, that very time was chosen for promulgating new orders and regulations as regards pleading in the courts at Cape Coast were at the same time promulgated and enforced. Previously, any person might appear as advocate or counsel for a prisoner—any one might conduct or defend a suit in the court. But all this was changed.

As in the case of the gross abuses and oppression which had long been practised in the Eastern Provinces, where the Governor took action against the local authorities in consequence of our exposé, so in this of the prison of Cape Coast, our existence was necessary for making known iniquity, and procuring a remedy. The letter No. 1,* on the Administration of Justice at Cape Coast, was in our possession and in type two months ago. But our great object is not notoriety for ourselves even in the good work we are performing, but the speedy and effective correction of evil. The charges contained in that letter against certain individuals, whose names we have not considered it necessary at present to insert, were too serious to admit of our public action without our obtaining what we might be justified in considering a full confirmation of them from others than the persons to whom we were originally indebted for the revelation. That confirmation we soon obtained. By this we do not mean a full confirmation of all there set forth, but of the alleged fact that prisoners are chained and otherwise ill-treated before trial, and have been also cruelly dealt with. But we felt convinced, also, that Her Majesty\'s Government were the first who ought to be made acquainted with the information we had received. We placed it before the Colonial-office as a charge of a very serious nature, necessarily calling for inquiry. And we do no more than render justice to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, when we make known the promptitude with which he immediately ordered such inquiries to be instituted.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""from time to time to call attention to abuses and oppression, most serious in their nature and degree, as affecting the fortunes, liberties, and even the lives of Her Majesty's subjects. But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.771, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is very possibly thought in home official circles that, as so many abuses have been corrected in West African administration since this journal first entered on its arduous task of cleansing the then Augean Stable, there cannot be any room for well-grounded complaint at the present time. But it should be remembered in that elevated sphere that, although the British Government authorities have almost entirely ignored the subject of Education, and that, if it had depended solely on them, the people of the British West Coast Settlements would at the present time be almost as ignorant as were their forefathers at the time when the Foreign Slave Trade was finally suppressed on the West African Coasts, other agencies have been steadily at work; that the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies have been educating the people, many of whom, also, through success in trading enterprise, have been able to obtain for themselves and their offspring the advantages of British culture in England and Scotland. And again, that, although so many abuses have been corrected, the old leaven of irresponsibility from which they spring, still remains; and that, although the public exhibition of its fruits—licentiousness, favouritism, and tyranny—has been in some measure restrained, that fruit still grows, and adds a new taint to the foul moral atmosphere of the Settlements. The letters and papers from the West Coast which we have from time to time published, and which we select from a host of such documents, show that a constant censorial vigilance over Administrative acts and conduct is still imperatively necessary, if those Settlements are to be pushed forward on the road of civilization. We have had occasion in late numbers of this journal to expose and comment upon the so-called administration of justice there. Our Lagos letters in this August number reopen the question, and expose a system of abuse of the forms of justice that arouses in us a strong feeling of indignation. We are jealous for the true fame of Great Britain. We would have our country sans peur et sans reproche; and it grieves our heart when we see that those who are entrusted with executive and legal powers abuse these in the shameful manner we have had and now again have to expose. Look at the picture shown by our Lagos correspondent. We have in a recent number called upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to limit the powers of Queen’s Advocates on the West Coast, to pay them an adequate salary, and to prohibit their appearing before the Courts as counsel in any but criminal cases where the prosecution really is by the Executive authorities. If this reform be not effected the stream of justice will continue to be poisoned at its source, and instead of being a purifying will be a poisonous and corrupting one. There are now in all the Settlements barristers-at-law who have been legally educated and taken their degrees in England, and the field of private practice ought to be left open entirely for these educated Africans, who in not a few instances have given proof of high ability and of legal knowledge fully on a par with the majority of Europeans who accept legal and judiciary functions in those countries. Then again, it has become quite time that what are called “local-made solicitors,” should be dispensed with. These self-constituted lawyers were perhaps necessary before young Africans legally educated in England went out to the Coast to practise. We have said perhaps the self-constituted lawyers, to whom renewable certificates were eventually given, might have been necessary, although we have had but too ample evidence from the Coast of the venality of most of these men, and of the shamelessness with which they plundered, and, when it could be made to their advantage, sold their clients. But whatever necessity, real or fancied, may have existed in the past, there can be no longer any need of the employment of those semi-legal bloodsuckers. We say without hesitation that certificates to these men should no longer be renewed. The employment by one of them in Lagos as clerk and interpreter (see letter, “Public Opinion”) of a man who has been notorious for fraud, and more than once convicted of felony, is a scandalous insult to the population among whom he is thus authorized and allowed to “practise.” This is a matter that should be looked to by the local authorities; while the limitation of the powers of Queen’s Advocates, who frequently become acting judges during the absence on leave of occupants of the Bench, ought to be without delay effected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But it is not alone in the administration of justice that gross abuses exist. The Executive fails in its obvious duty on many points. We shall only mention one or two here, although their name is legion, and in this we confine ourselves still to Lagos. How often have we pointed out that Lagos should be a focus of civilization, whence precept and example should act on the intelligent barbarism of the Egba and Yoruba countries; and how greatly we have had to deplore that such civilizing influence has never yet been exerted. And we can scarcely now hope that within our time it will be exerted. We had hoped, too, that the publication of a well-conducted paper in Lagos, the Lagos Times, would have given a voice to public opinion sufficiently strong to lead to the correction of such abuses as that which has been strongly brought before us of the neglect to light the streets of Lagos. Well-lighted streets would constitute a difference between Lagos and the interior heathen towns that every visitor from the interior would see, and would speedily appreciate. And yet such is the culpable lethargy of the Executive, in or over which the educated native public of Lagos has no power, that, although the lamps and appliances for adequately lighting Lagos throughout have been procured and do exist, no lighting takes place except in the immediate neighbourhood of Government House and the adjoining residences of some principal officials and merchants. This is a scandalous remissness on the part of the Executive, and the more scandalous because the police of Lagos is distributed, or rather concentrated, on the same principle and in the same locality as the light. By this ingenious process on the part of the authorities the greater portion of the town is made over to darkness and depredators, and has become most notoriously unsafe both for persons and property. Burglary, robbery, and violence are said to be of nightly occurrence. There seems to be a rather large criminal element among the Lagos population; and most certainly, with a local revenue of some £50,000 a year, this ought to be kept adequately in check by street lights and a sufficiently numerous, good, and well-distributed police. That it is not so is a disgrace to the Executive authorities, a reproach to British rule, and leads us moreover to ask the question whether the time has not arrived at which some independent native element should be admitted to the Executive and Legislative Council. There are many local quicksands which a European Executive cannot discover; many local wants with which a European Executive will not sufficiently, if at all, sympathize. The addition of a thoroughly independent elected native element in the Council would bring in that knowledge and sympathy, and would be tending in the direction indicated by the House of Commons Committee of 1864-5, preparing the natives for self-government, under, of course, the sovereign control of Great Britain. Education, by the action of Missionary High Schools in West Africa, and the constantly deepening stream of youth sent by their parents to England for medical, legal, and general instruction, is really making considerable progress among a section of the population of the Settlements, as indicated by the gradual formation of local Bars, constituted by members of the Temple and Lincoln’s Inn; by the increasing number of medical practitioners who are members of the London and Edinburgh College of Surgeons and Physicians; and not least in importance by the number of young men who have been sent to England to be educated in the higher branches of learning, and who are now returning to their native land to take their part in the work of civilization and progress. It is to these men that we must look for the future development of the West African Settlements, and it is to them that the British Government must look for the future maintenance of its influence and authority in those regions. The time has come when the British Government must recognize the fact that the West African Settlements are no longer mere outposts of Empire, but are becoming integral parts of the British dominions, with a population that is rapidly advancing in intelligence and civilization, and that is entitled to a voice in the management of its own affairs. The sooner this is recognized, the better it will be for all concerned.\n**91**', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.729, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Judicial Staff at Sierra Leone for the Whole West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Parsimony, or an undue economy in the administration of justice, is a great public calamity. If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**"", 'last_edit_date': '1868-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are two essentials in the administration of justice: the one is that it should be pure, enlightened, and impartial; the other, that the people among whom it is administered should believe it to be so. Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.747, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

The chiefs in the interior also are ordered to refer their disputes with each other to Cape Coast, and to answer there any charges brought against them by the Government. In ordinary cases they submit. It is cheaper for them to do so than to resist. But in consequence of the absence of territorial right beyond the narrow limits of the forts and settlements, judges and magistrates holding their authority from the British Crown are placed in the disgraceful and dishonouring position of being compelled to use their authority for the enforcement of native laws diametrically at variance with those of Great Britain. Under their mandate, runaway slaves are delivered up to their masters; and every wife and concubine, be it remembered, is a slave! We have lately seen in our columns under what circumstances of atrocity this had been done at Accra. British authorities do at the Gold Coast, under orders from England—which it would be impossible to justify—what, if done elsewhere without orders, would subject them to criminal prosecution and severe punishment. British authority is thus made the minister and upholder of slavery, polygamy, and other atrocities of heathenism and barbarism; too often even, it is to be feared, the involuntary abettor of murder and superstitious human sacrifice. Meanwhile, with a few honourable exceptions, the British employés, civil and military, as well as mercantile agents, have acted as if they were sent out to carry on a propaganda of drunkenness and debauchery. The climate, and the necessities which the climate is supposed to engender, have been urged and seemingly admitted, as an excuse for every kind of vicious excess. We have a host of concurrent testimony that the greater portion of the deaths which have occurred among Europeans in these settlements, and elsewhere on the West Coast, have been not from climate per se, but from climate acting upon persons improperly selected, brought from other enervating climates (such as the West Indies, &c.), with constitutions impaired, or upon systems vitiated and enfeebled by abominable impurity and dissipation. It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents. According to the custom of the country, these are marriages; but the Europeans contracting these alliances consider them as only a temporary convenience; and for the most part, when they leave the Coast to return to England, not only are the women abandoned, but the children born of them also, without any provision being made for them, and seemingly without remorse on the part of him who leaves them.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As a general rule, law is by no means a cheap commodity.

Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.739, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BATHURST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—Owing to the great abuses reported repeatedly by ""The Gambian,"" and the gross injustice that has prevailed in the Gambia courts, one Mr. Reffie has been sent over to England by the black inhabitants of the River Gambia to study law, in order that he may be in some degree qualified to defend his fellow-countrymen from the injustice to which they are from time to time compelled to submit in the court of that colony.\n\nThe weight of the one branch of the Gambia law is equal to a waggon burden; but we shall still despair of obtaining justice if merchants and their clerks are to continue to be the magistrates and commissioners in their courts.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

1095,The transition from military to civil police in Bathurst indicates a strategic shift in colonial governance towards a more community-oriented and less militarized approach.,"The transition from military to civil police in Bathurst, as discussed in The African Times, indicates a strategic shift in colonial governance towards a more community-oriented and less militarized approach. The news articles detail the replacement of the frontier police with a civil police force following a riot, a change that was well-received by the public and led to the restoration of order. This suggests a deliberate effort to address community grievances and improve relations between colonial authorities and the local population. The articles highlight inefficiencies in the military-style police force, such as the lack of detectives and a focus on parade over effective policing, supporting the claim of a shift towards less militarized governance to enhance community trust and cooperation. However, the broader strategic intentions behind this transition remain ambiguous, as the articles do not explicitly discuss whether it was part of a larger colonial policy shift or a response to specific local circumstances.

By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner.

The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured.

But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.574, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': ""While it is easy to enumerate the forces making for social change in colonial Africa, it is less easy to catalogue the changes which each force brought about.

Thus the loss of the war of resistance against the colonial powers could quite easily lead to a loss of faith in the old priests and gods and to a decision to embrace the supposedly superior faith of the conquerors. The success of the conquerors had other side effects as well. The old military classes, where they existed, could not continue, under the new dispensation, to live on militarism. Nor could the old political elite who had lived by ruling continue to do so unless they were recruited into the political service of the colony whether as 'native authorities' under indirect rule or as tax collectors and intelligence agents under the so-called direct rule. In other words, many of the old political, military, economic and religious elites had to embrace new professions either in place of or in addition to the old ones. Thus not all who seized the new economic opportunities offered by alien rule did so simply in response to the attractions of the new economic regime. Some who migrated to the new urban centres did so not just because of the lure of urbanism, but because the military conquest and the consequent political settlement made their positions in the rural areas obsolescent and untenable.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property.

More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

It is clear that the trend was towards a gradual decline in the power of the purely military and alien element to the advantage of the 'political' fraction of the ruling class. The process culminated in the 'revolution' of 'Alî Khßdja, who dealt ruthlessly with the militia, in 1817, and drew support from certain sections of the local population, such as the kologlus (people of mixed Turkish and Arab blood) and the Zwawa Kabyles.$^{62}$ This was exactly the turn which events had taken in Tunisia and Tripoli, but in Algeria the trend developed a hundred years later. Changes occurred earlier in the eastern or western provinces (beyliks). Ever since the eighteenth century, the beys had been compelled to rely on predominantly 'Arab' armed forces and to practise a skilful policy of forming alliances with local notables.$^{63}$ This was one of the reasons why the resistance to French occupation was more prolonged and more stubborn in those provinces than in Algiers and its region.\nDespite these signs of change, the 'Algerian' regime, as a whole, retained until practically the end of its existence its non-indigenous character, which generated contradictions and sharp conflicts. Serious uprisings, under religious leadership provided by the brotherhoods, shook the western part of the country from 1803 to 1805 and a large area in Kabylia in 1814-15. 64 A kind of 'national' reaction was taking shape before the French conquest and it foreshadowed 'Abd al-Kädir's iminent enterprise."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.572, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure', 'content': ""In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

It is constructed at the base of a gradual descent; so that when, as of late, it rains very heavily, all around the camp is something like a mud swamp. The bush having been only so lately cleared, the earth which has thus become exposed cannot be expected to exhale anything else but malaria, and therefore it will be contrary to all the rules of hygiene to expect the camp at Prahsoo to be healthy. Its close proximity to the river, although pleasant, tends, of course, to increase the dampness of the encampment. The contrast between the atmosphere during the day and night is too sudden for health, the variation being more than 20 degrees. Whilst the excitement lasted there was very little sickness, but after a residence of sixteen days one, and another, and another, became so dreadfully ill, that the medical officer in charge was obliged to invalid them to the seacoast; so that within eight weeks of their arrival in the bush nearly the whole of the officers left the Prah for Cape Coast in a dreadful state. The troops arrived at the Prah about the 1st February, and on the 8th April, when the Tamar anchored in Cape Coast roadstead, there were fourteen officers of the 4th West at the Castle; and such was their state of health, that at the dinner given to *fête* the arrival of the reinforcement, only one was able to leave his bed and meet them, and even he was in a dreadful state of debility. Out of twenty-six officers who left the Coast for the field, fifteen, or thereabout, have been invalided home, in a very precarious state, three have died, and four are still obliged to keep their bed, though not sufficiently ill to be invalided. Of the soldiers many have died, principally from dysentery. A great many are so weak, that, in all probability, they will not be fit for active service in the field for the next twelve months. Of the twelve medical officers on the Coast, three have been invalided, one has died, and three are still prostrated with fever. Of the soldiers of the detachment of the 1st West India Regiment sent up to Prahsoo on the 24th April, we gather from the report of the medical officer in charge that seventeen were admitted into hospital within three days of their arrival in the camp, and that an average of twenty were daily reported sick. Such, then, is the present position of the troops on the Gold Coast. It is dreadful to both Africans and Europeans; and should the Government intend to have it supplied with troops from the West Indies, it must be prepared to find means of properly rationing them with fresh provisions. It is a great pity to bring a lot of men here to sacrifice their lives; and whenever a lasting peace is proclaimed between our Government and the King of Ashantee, I think it will not be an imprudent act to have the Coast supplied, according to the recommendation of Sir Benjamin Pine, with a strong police constabulary and a small detachment of only about 100 men. The troops on the whole of the West Coast should, I also think, be under the command of a major-general, whose residence should be at Sierra Leone, and the detachment here should be relieved every year. This will be a very great improvement on all sides, both for the officers and men, and the mortality will be by far less than it would be if the men were to be fed continually for three years on salt beef and pork.'}, {'id': 4046, 'article_title': 'River Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'River Gambia', 'last_edit_date': '08-26-1880', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1880#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_10_1880', 'content': 'The moral of all this is that efficiency should not be sacrificed to economy; which has been in all departments too much the case here during the past four years; and, that where it is necessary to employ a white Commandant for the sake of the influence and prestige he has among savage tribes, such necessity should not be ignored for the sake of saving, say, 100l. a year, by employing a native; for it is a melancholy fact that the savage tribes will not, as yet, respect or obey, or even listen to, a man of their own colour.

We have no right to expect a perfect Police force in Bathurst more than in any other part of the world, nor that all native officials and Church schoolmasters shall behave as they ought to behave in their several vocations. But there can be no doubt in any right-thinking mind that a remedy, and a prompt and effectual one, ought to be found and applied by official and Church authorities to such irregularities and offences as are exposed in these letters of which we write. In the letter signed ""O.,"" which was first received and in press before the other came to hand, the inefficiency of the Police as a Police is strongly dwelt upon. There cannot, however, be any just cause for wonder that the Police is inefficient, after the perusal of the letter of ""Morning Star."" The disgrace, under such circumstances, rests with the authorities—not on the Police body itself. If notorious, proved thieves be continued in the force through interest made with a careless Executive on their behalf, the Police will, as a necessary result, be discredited in public opinion, and fail in the performance of duties for which Police forces are established. There is reason, however, to fear that utility is at Bathurst sacrificed to show. Since the withdrawal of regular troops from Bathurst, the authorities have only the Police as a parade force, and all other considerations are made subservient to that of display on certain public occasions. It is time, we think, that a sounder system should be inaugurated. A Police force, to be respectable, must be respected; and to be efficient, every offence on the part of its members should be dealt with summarily and rigidly.

The cause of the rising is said to have been the shooting of a Mohammedan while the latter was at prayer. The police are recruited at Sierra Leone, and are not Mohammedans: for a long time bickerings have been very frequent between the Natives and the police, and the killing of the Mohammedan caused a rising of the whole Native population. These armed, some with firearms, others with sticks and stones, attacked the police. The latter fired on the mob, and on both sides many persons were injured. The police made for their barracks, which are in the centre of the town, and on reaching the building barricaded the doors. The mob tried to force these but without success, and towards evening the crowd turned their attentions to Government House, where Mr. Llewelyn, the Governor, was with about six white officials. The mob, in a threatening manner, demanded the expulsion of the police from the town. The Governor advised the Natives to be quiet, but a number of them made for the flag-staff in the garden where the British flag was flying and attempted to pull it down. The officials, however, with whips and canes, defended the post, and kept the flag flying. The officers purposely avoided shedding any blood, and were able eventually to get the crowd outside the gates without sacrificing a single life. Mr. Llewelyn read the Riot Act, and promised the mob that the police should be removed. The crowd then retired from Government House. A tornado, accompanied by a deluge of rain, happened very opportunely to break over the place, and expedited considerably the restoration of order. The authorities then went to the barracks, and the police were taken in batches of about a dozen each to the river, and were placed on board the Government steam yacht Mansie-Keelah.

Colonel Conran, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast, and in this capacity resident at Cape Coast Castle, has up to the present time justified the hopes we had formed, the expectations we entertained of him. Only a few days after his arrival he called together the native authorities of the town, which is situate under the guns of Cape Coast Castle, and laid before them his plans and suggestions for the removal of nuisances and abuses which preceding Governors had tolerated, but which, unremoved and unremedied, were effectual barriers to all progress in the material evidences of civilisation. And without the material evidences of civilisation, no real progress of civilisation is possible. We refer our readers to Governor Conran's address to the King and chiefs, and other native authorities. We like to get our justification from time to time by official documents. This of Governor Conran's is an important one for us. It gives such a catalogue of official British neglect that we can point to it with confidence and say, have we exaggerated the evil state of affairs at Cape Coast? have we unjustly charged British authorities and officials with attending only to their own private interests, and, but too often, most immoral pursuits, and neglecting all that could really promote the well-being of a people who require to be taught even the very first steps in the great onward march of progressive civilisation? The streets impassable, because so encumbered with putrifying animal filth and decomposed vegetable matter!—every house a graveyard!—no proper supply of water!—no observance of the Christian Sabbath! We refrain from giving the whole catalogue. It is a damning one to successive batches of past officials, and to some present ones; and we thank Colonel and Governor Conran from our hearts for his so speedy and vigorous effort for the real material good of the population at large, and for the health of Europeans and others whose duties entail upon them the necessity of residence in Cape Coast Town or Castle. And we thank him the more heartily because we feel deeply for him in the trying position in which he has been placed by events so unexpected when he was addressing the native authorities. The conflict which has taken place between the West India soldiers of the garrison and the natives was a most unhappy commentary on the very humane and proper caution given by the Governor to the native authorities with regard to those culpable excesses which too generally attend the noisy, riotous heathen festivals. The Governor threatened the extremest penalties of the law— the British law—should lives be lost in any party fight among the natives; and lo, instead of such party fights the soldiers of the garrison ran riot in the town, killed two or three people, and gravely wounded some sixty others. The good discipline of the troops under Colonel Conran had during the past twelve months been the constant theme of letters from Cape Coast. But it seems as if during the Colonel's absence in England to give evidence before the Parliamentary Committee discipline had been relaxed, and the result is of course that which always occurs in such cases—deplorable excesses, which must necessarily entail punishment on the offenders, and subject the whole corps to restrictions, painful for the commander to order, and for the men to endure. We do not think it necessary to make any further remarks at present on this painful subject, as we have the fullest confidence that Colonel Conran, Lieut.-Governor and Commander-in-Chief on the Gold Coast, will do all that is necessary for the enforcement of proper discipline, and that justice to the injured and to the relatives of the slain can properly demand.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn.

In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

Throughout this period editorials vigorously denounced and carefully documented the abuses inherent in the system of chíbalo.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

In those circumstances, the few strikes in which they took part in the ports (1928) or the railways (1933) were no more than flashes in the pan, and came to nothing, for there was no lasting unity between white labourers and black unskilled workers.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""In short, Africans incurred heavy social and economic costs under colonial rule.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures.

But, although the objection was not raised at the trial to the witnesses speaking as to the substance of the destroyed libel, yet the Court raised it in giving its decision.\n\nThe Chief Justice here observed that what he complained of was that the plaintiff had set out one thing in his declaration and proved another, and that there was a fatal variance. All the witnesses stated that the defendant had prohibited plaintiff from exercising his profession in his court till he had apologised, a fact not disclosed in the declaration.'}, {'id': 1700, 'article_title': 'SUPREME COURT, Nov. 29, 1869', 'full_section_title': 'SUPREME COURT, Nov. 29, 1869', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-3', 'issue_date': '24_01_1870', 'content': '\n\nMr. Rainy replied that he would make the defendant a present of that. That the Court seemed to think that because his witnesses had stated what was in the defendant\'s letter, relative to his alleged misconduct and the apology required, it was necessary to set it forth in the declaration; but he would submit that that was not required by law—in fact, that the words relative to plaintiff\'s misconduct were a gross falsehood. All the witnesses\' statements corresponded exactly in substance, if not in words, with the libel as set forth in his declaration. What did the declaration say? It simply said this—that the defendant had written a certain libel of the plaintiff, containing the following words: ""Tell Gilpin that I have prohibited Mr. Rainy from practising in my court, and there is no necessity for him to employ a lawyer, but if he required a lawyer he was to employ Mr. Walcott, who was a clever lawyer, and, what\'s more, he was an honest man."" Now what was the law on the subject? It is clearly laid down that a plaintiff in a libel case need not prove all the words, provided he prove enough to show a libel. Suppose the words which the witness Gilpin swore to—namely, ""As he (Mr. Rainy) came to the court on Saturday and insulted me whilst on the bench, and unless he come and make an ample apology in open court""—were set forth in the declaration, of what good would it have been to the merits of the case? They are redundant and superfluous. If they had been stated and not proved, they could have done the defendant no good; they were not stated, and it seems contrary to common sense that they can do the defendant any good by Gilpin\'s stating they were in the letter. Then comes the question, Has Gilpin proved enough of the declaration to sustain this action? It is submitted that he has done so. He says: ""I recollect being in the Police-court when a letter was read by Metzger from Major Bravo. There were about seventy or eighty persons present. Silence was proclaimed before the letter was read by the Police Clerk. I heard read out the words: \'Tell Gilpin as I am engaged at Government House his case will be remanded till the next day, and he required no lawyer, but if he is so foolish as to employ one, he must not employ Mr. Rainy.\'"" Now are not these words, proceeding from a police magistrate to a suitor in case before him, sufficient of themselves to entitle the barrister spoken of to bring an action for them. It cannot be denied that such words, under the circumstances, would be calculated to have a damaging effect upon a barrister\'s professional reputation, and to operate injuriously to him. And if such is the case—if it cannot be denied that such words would be calculated to be damaging and injurious to a barrister in his professional capacity—then clearly they are sufficient to entitle him to bring an action for them. Then are not these words to be found substantially set forth in the declaration? The Court seemed to assume that because Major Bravo stated in his letter that he had prohibited the plaintiff from practising in his court till he had made an apology for his improper conduct, that he was in fact guilty of impropriety of conduct. That portion of Major Bravo\'s letter was, as before stated, a gross falsehood; nothing of the sort had occurred. It was a trick invented by the defendant to get rid of the plaintiff at the Police-court, and to transfer his practice to the notorious Walcott. Where is the proof of the plaintiff\'s improper conduct beyond what the defendant wrote to the Police Clerk? Certainly none was given at the trial; none had been pleaded in justification. Taking it for granted, however, that the plaintiff had been discourteous to the defendant in the Police-court, where did the law give him the power to prohibit him (plaintiff) as a barrister on that account, and in a letter, too, written at his own house? Such a power would be monstrous, and if there is no redress for it in this court, then no professional man is safe in this colony.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

But it should be remembered in that elevated sphere that, although the British Government authorities have almost entirely ignored the subject of Education, and that, if it had depended solely on them, the people of the British West Coast Settlements would at the present time be almost as ignorant as were their forefathers at the time when the Foreign Slave Trade was finally suppressed on the West African Coasts, other agencies have been steadily at work; that the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies have been educating the people, many of whom, also, through success in trading enterprise, have been able to obtain for themselves and their offspring the advantages of British culture in England and Scotland. And again, that, although so many abuses have been corrected, the old leaven of irresponsibility from which they spring, still remains; and that, although the public exhibition of its fruits—licentiousness, favouritism, and tyranny—has been in some measure restrained, that fruit still grows, and adds a new taint to the foul moral atmosphere of the Settlements. The letters and papers from the West Coast which we have from time to time published, and which we select from a host of such documents, show that a constant censorial vigilance over Administrative acts and conduct is still imperatively necessary, if those Settlements are to be pushed forward on the road of civilization. We have had occasion in late numbers of this journal to expose and comment upon the so-called administration of justice there. Our Lagos letters in this August number reopen the question, and expose a system of abuse of the forms of justice that arouses in us a strong feeling of indignation. We are jealous for the true fame of Great Britain. We would have our country sans peur et sans reproche; and it grieves our heart when we see that those who are entrusted with executive and legal powers abuse these in the shameful manner we have had and now again have to expose. Look at the picture shown by our Lagos correspondent. We have in a recent number called upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to limit the powers of Queen’s Advocates on the West Coast, to pay them an adequate salary, and to prohibit their appearing before the Courts as counsel in any but criminal cases where the prosecution really is by the Executive authorities. If this reform be not effected the stream of justice will continue to be poisoned at its source, and instead of being a purifying will be a poisonous and corrupting one. There are now in all the Settlements barristers-at-law who have been legally educated and taken their degrees in England, and the field of private practice ought to be left open entirely for these educated Africans, who in not a few instances have given proof of high ability and of legal knowledge fully on a par with the majority of Europeans who accept legal and judiciary functions in those countries. Then again, it has become quite time that what are called “local-made solicitors,” should be dispensed with. These self-constituted lawyers were perhaps necessary before young Africans legally educated in England went out to the Coast to practise. We have said perhaps the self-constituted lawyers, to whom renewable certificates were eventually given, might have been necessary, although we have had but too ample evidence from the Coast of the venality of most of these men, and of the shamelessness with which they plundered, and, when it could be made to their advantage, sold their clients. But whatever necessity, real or fancied, may have existed in the past, there can be no longer any need of the employment of those semi-legal bloodsuckers. We say without hesitation that certificates to these men should no longer be renewed. The employment by one of them in Lagos as clerk and interpreter (see letter, “Public Opinion”) of a man who has been notorious for fraud, and more than once convicted of felony, is a scandalous insult to the population among whom he is thus authorized and allowed to “practise.” This is a matter that should be looked to by the local authorities; while the limitation of the powers of Queen’s Advocates, who frequently become acting judges during the absence on leave of occupants of the Bench, ought to be without delay effected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But it is not alone in the administration of justice that gross abuses exist. The Executive fails in its obvious duty on many points. We shall only mention one or two here, although their name is legion, and in this we confine ourselves still to Lagos. How often have we pointed out that Lagos should be a focus of civilization, whence precept and example should act on the intelligent barbarism of the Egba and Yoruba countries; and how greatly we have had to deplore that such civilizing influence has never yet been exerted. And we can scarcely now hope that within our time it will be exerted. We had hoped, too, that the publication of a well-conducted paper in Lagos, the Lagos Times, would have given a voice to public opinion sufficiently strong to lead to the correction of such abuses as that which has been strongly brought before us of the neglect to light the streets of Lagos. Well-lighted streets would constitute a difference between Lagos and the interior heathen towns that every visitor from the interior would see, and would speedily appreciate. And yet such is the culpable lethargy of the Executive, in or over which the educated native public of Lagos has no power, that, although the lamps and appliances for adequately lighting Lagos throughout have been procured and do exist, no lighting takes place except in the immediate neighbourhood of Government House and the adjoining residences of some principal officials and merchants. This is a scandalous remissness on the part of the Executive, and the more scandalous because the police of Lagos is distributed, or rather concentrated, on the same principle and in the same locality as the light. By this ingenious process on the part of the authorities the greater portion of the town is made over to darkness and depredators, and has become most notoriously unsafe both for persons and property. Burglary, robbery, and violence are said to be of nightly occurrence. There seems to be a rather large criminal element among the Lagos population; and most certainly, with a local revenue of some £50,000 a year, this ought to be kept adequately in check by street lights and a sufficiently numerous, good, and well-distributed police. That it is not so is a disgrace to the Executive authorities, a reproach to British rule, and leads us moreover to ask the question whether the time has not arrived at which some independent native element should be admitted to the Executive and Legislative Council. There are many local quicksands which a European Executive cannot discover; many local wants with which a European Executive will not sufficiently, if at all, sympathize. The addition of a thoroughly independent elected native element in the Council would bring in that knowledge and sympathy, and would be tending in the direction indicated by the House of Commons Committee of 1864-5, preparing the natives for self-government, under, of course, the sovereign control of Great Britain. Education, by the action of Missionary High Schools in West Africa, and the constantly deepening stream of youth sent by their parents to England for medical, legal, and general instruction, is really making considerable progress among a section of the population of the Settlements, as indicated by the gradual formation of local Bars, constituted by members of the Temple and Lincoln’s Inn; by the increasing number of medical practitioners who are members of the London and Edinburgh College of Surgeons and Physicians; and not least in importance by the number of young men who have been sent to England to be educated in the higher branches of learning, and who are now returning to their native land to take their part in the work of civilization and progress. It is to these men that we must look for the future development of the West African Settlements, and it is to them that the British Government must look for the future maintenance of its influence and authority in those regions. The time has come when the British Government must recognize the fact that the West African Settlements are no longer mere outposts of Empire, but are becoming integral parts of the British dominions, with a population that is rapidly advancing in intelligence and civilization, and that is entitled to a voice in the management of its own affairs. The sooner this is recognized, the better it will be for all concerned.\n**91**', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I met in St. Louis an English-born Freetown negress who told me that, having a dispute about property in Freetown, she had gone to law there.

The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English.

This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

""A young man, by name Moses (R. E. Moses), purchased a cask or two of rum from one of the wholesale merchants in this town. At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.591, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liverpool and the African Trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**THE TRIAL OF DR. PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.584, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sna, a Krooman, v. the African Steamship Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In order that any further observation we may have to make upon this case, and the serious question involved by the course taken by the African Royal Mail Steamship Company, we think it right again to state that this poor Krooman, Sna, lost one of his legs whilst working as a labourer on board of one of the Company\'s steamers on the West Coast of Africa.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

This foreign interference intensified in proportion to the settlers' increasing need for cheap indigenous labour to work on the farms and in the mines, and for the hut tax to meet at least part of the administrative expenses. Africans were compelled to vacate their homelands to make room for white settlers and to serve as army 'volunteers'. In Rhodesia (Northern and Southern) and Nyasaland, the Chartered Company administrators simply trans› planted the 'Native Laws' of South Africa. In Rhodesia, where white settle› ment was the heaviest, the administration tolerated no obstacles to its economic ventures, even if these obstacles were Shona lives and rights. It readily commandeered Shona lands, livestock, crops and stores of food and subjected the Shona to forced labour to serve the interest of the settlers, who had been drawn to Mashonaland with promises of a better, easier and richer way of life. Above all, the colonial justice introduced was characterized by arbitrariness and irregularities. Coupled with all this was a succession of natural disasters, including epidemics of smallpox and rinderpest, drought and even a plague of locusts.

In this atmosphere of colonialism, landlessness, destitution, oppression and westernization, most of them came to believe, like the Xhosa, that the white man was the cause of all their troubles. Resentment against alien rule engendered - during the 1890s and early 1900s - a growing attitude of resistance towards whites and a strong sense of unity among political leaders, followers, priests and even formerly hostile groups. Examples of such responses aimed at overthrowing the colonial system because of its unbearable oppression and exploitation were the Ndebele-Shona Chimurenga of 1896-7, the Herero revolt of 1904 and the Bambata or Zulu rebellion of 1906."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.595, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola', 'content': ""Regarded as nonentities by the Europeans, subject to corporal punishment, and sometimes to arbitrary and venal treatment at the hands of the colonial authorities, to the demands of labour-recruiters and the collusion between government officials and resident Portuguese, Africans became outcasts in their own countries.

There were fewer and fewer leaders, most weapons had been confiscated and gunpowder was, with a few exceptions, no longer available on the open market. The second alternative was to go into hiding. When the situation became intolerable, entire villages abandoned their fields and moved to areas furthest from the reach of the colonial authorities. Peasant flight was particularly common in the northern and eastern regions which remained effectively outside Lisbon's control. Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final. There is widespread evidence of massive clandestine emigration into the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia and even South West Africa. Often members of the rural population travelled great distances through harsh terrain with young children on their backs to free themselves from the tyranny of Portuguese colonial rule. If they were caught by the colonial authorities or the local African police, the men were beaten and imprisoned and the women sexually abused.\nThe fourth type of resistance to colonial rule were the religious or messianic cults founded by Africans in reaction to the colonial religion.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land. Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.593, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914', 'content': ""and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""Like the slaves in the American South, many African peasants covertly retaliated against the repressive system.

Just before the arrival of the tax collector, all or part of a village would flee into an inaccessible region until the state official departed. In Northern Rhodesia, the Gwemba Tonga were notoriously successful evaders, as were their Bisa and Unga neighbours who fled into the Bagwelu swamps.$^{35}$ This practice was so common in Mozambique that one official noted in disgust, 'It remains unknown how many times six or more adults will flee from their kraal leaving only a blind, ill or elderly individual who is exempt from taxes'.$^{36}$ Those Africans fortunate enough to live along international borders could slide back and forth across the frontier avoiding the tax collectors of both colonies.

They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue.

Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying. What attention this displayed upon the part of the physician and jailer of the prison! Chief Magistrate Parker is so fond (in the indulgence of an ignorant and despotic spirit) of crowding prisons, surely he should see that some sort of sanatory provision should be carried on within their dismal\n\nprecincts!

Kidd and M'Coskry, of Liverpool. His victim was a little girl eight years of age. We cannot enter into the filthy details, though all the evidence is before us. He was tried on the 6th of the present month. The result is, in our opinion, disgraceful to the jury, and not so creditable as we could wish to the judge. How any jury could, upon the evidence, have acquitted Lubley of the *rape*, when among other conclusive evidence it was proved that the poor child was bleeding during four days, we cannot possibly conceive. But we hope to get some explanation of this. Having, however, thus escaped upon the capital charge, he pleaded *Guilty* to that of criminal assault with attempt, &c.; and here, again, his good fortune did not desert him. The judge sentenced him to *four months' imprisonment*, with hard labour. This last part, of course, for a *European* at Lagos is a farce; and so four months' imprisonment is considered adequate punishment for that act of beastly atrocity. One of our duties is to demand equal justice for the coloured and white subjects of Her Majesty in Lagos and elsewhere on the West Coast; and we ask, would the trial have had such results if the child had been white, the daughter of a European resident at Lagos, and the criminal one of the educated Africans there? We do not hesitate to say that the accused would have been found guilty of the capital offence, and been hung or sentenced to imprisonment for a long term of years; or, even supposing the impossibility that he could have had the good fortune of Lubley and been acquitted of the capital offence, we are quite sure that for the criminal assault he would, and most deservedly, have been sentenced, even by that same judge, to four years, instead of four months' imprisonment.

Five white farmers were charged with tying up natives and cruelly flogging them. Two of the natives were so badly injured that they had to be removed to hospital, and one of them died of blood poisoning resulting from his wounds. The defendants were indicted for culpable homicide in the one case, and assault in respect of the others; and the Solicitor-General, who prosecuted for the Crown, described the narrative as exhibiting ""a monotony of brutality.""\n\nFor the defence it was alleged that nothing more than a ""common assault"" had been committed, and only by one of the farmers, Mr. J. P. T. Hart. Mr. Hart himself gave evidence, in which he said that he had only used a ""reim,"" not a ""sjambok,"" in flogging the natives, who had been killing valuable sheep belonging to him. His anger at his losses had something to do with the severity of the punishment. The jury found the defendants guilty of ""common assault under great provocation,"" but acquitted them altogether on the other indictment.\n\nMr. Justice Jones, while admitting that there was some reason for the merciful view taken by the jury regarding the former charge, characterised the verdict of acquittal on the charge of homicide as ""a disgrace to the community.""

""A young man, by name Moses (R. E. Moses), purchased a cask or two of rum from one of the wholesale merchants in this town. At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European Example in West Africa—Brutal Criminal Assault on a Child', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Shall we not appeal to our English residents, and inquire how they lived among us here in West Africa?

The first treaty was that of 1873, which gave Ja Ja power to fine all European traders who attempted to trade beyond certain defined limits in his territory. The treaty of 1884, concluded after the Berlin Congress, established a protectorate over Opobo. All went well until 1886, when, trade in palm oil being depressed, traders wished to get rid of the middlemen and trade directly beyond the districts opened to Europeans in Opobo. To this King Ja Ja objected. Consul Hewitt had assured him that by the protectorate the Queen did not want to take his country or his markets; that she had no wish to disturb his rule. Nevertheless, because King Ja Ja refused to allow the European traders to break the express terms of his treaty by trading directly in the reserved region, he has been first fined, then his trade has been destroyed, and lastly, he has been arrested under circumstances of great treachery by Consul Johnston, and carried off a prisoner to the Gold Coast.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened.

Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed. Undoubtedly disease and famine followed the break-up of the village organization of labour and the flight of whole villages.$^{70}$ No one kept adequate population records See J.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them.

Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The Yaka periodically fled across the Kwango River which separated Angola and the Congo, while their compatriots took advantage of the unpatrolled frontier to cross into the French Congo where they remained until harassed by local tax officials. 37 A similar strategy was employed by disenchanted members of the rural populations living in the Milanje region along the Nyasaland-Mozambique border and in the Gaerezi Valley separating Rhodesia and Mozambique."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The Prisoner pleaded ""Not guilty."" He was defended by Mr. James Brew. The substance of the case was simply this: The prisoner was the Chief Landing Waiter of Her Majesty\'s Customs here. On Sunday, the 27th of October, the prisoner sent for his assistant, named Hilton, by a little boy of his. The boy did not see Hilton, but saw the deceased, Jim, who was servant to Hilton, and he delivered his message to the Krooboy that his master, Hagan, wanted Hilton. The Krooboy told him that his master was asleep, and he would not wake him. An altercation took place, in which the deceased Krooboy pushed Hagan\'s boy, and he returned back to his master crying; whereupon the prisoner Hagan at once, in a violent rage, which he always exhibited to the helpless and the weak, sent a big slave servant of his, named Hebbit, to go at once to fetch both Hilton and this poor Krooboy to him immediately, which he did. As soon as they entered his house, Hagan at once commenced, with a good-sized horsewhip, to flog and beat this poor Krooboy on the top of the stairs, and followed up the beating down the stairs whilst the Krooboy was trying to run away from him. In running down the steps his foot slipped, and he fell downstairs, and Hagan still continued to beat him unmercifully, till the boy\'s back and sides were cut open and blood gushing out freely. This outrage was done in the presence of Hilton, the Krooboy\'s master, on that holy day. Hilton asked Hagan, ""What has my boy done to you that you should give him such a beating?"" He replied, ""He assaulted my boy when I sent him to call you."" The Krooboy ran away to his countrymen and friends, and told them what Hegan had done to him, and told them that in falling downstairs he had hurt his ribs. Then he returned to his master\'s house, and told the same tale to Hilton\'s wife; and from that time the boy never ate anything, his appetite being gone. But Hilton was afraid that if he sent the Krooboy to the Colonial Hospital he should involve his superior officer. He therefore endeavoured to hide this matter from the authorities, and did his best to save Hagan, by sending him to fetch his meals to the beach the next morning and the following. On Wednesday he was worse; they tried to get him to eat, but he complained of pains in his side and chest, and yet no medical advice was given him. But on Wednesday evening, finding he was getting worse, Hilton\'s wife gave the boy some native medicine used for asthmatic complaints. About midnight of that day he called out to his master, and while his master held him he died. The next morning, Thursday, they found blood gushing out from his mouth and nose, and some other matter. Instead of Hilton reporting the matter to the District Commissioner, he went to Hagan, the prisoner, to tell him that the Krooboy was dead, meaning that his cruel act had taken effect, and asked what he should do. The result of that interview was, that this Krooboy was privately hurried to the grave; and this would have been the last of it. The true cause of his death would never have been known by any person in this world, had it not been that the other Krooboys, who were indignant and in a great rage, got some kind friends, natives of Sierra Leone, to write a letter for them, reporting the circumstances, to the District Commissioner, who at once caused an inquiry to be made, and ordered the Acting Colonial Surgeon to have the poor boy\'s body exhumed, on Friday, the 1st instant, before a coroner and a jury. On a *post-mortem* examination they found the body in a high state of decomposition, so that Dr. Elliott stated that it was impossible to hold an examination, but he stated on his oath before the Court, that he saw abrasions upon his body, and that the horsewhip produced in court, if severely used on the Krooboy, who was only eighteen years of age, was sufficient to cause the loss of appetite, and the symptoms on his body; and that death would be the result.'}, {'id': 3983, 'article_title': 'Misfortune upon Misfortune—Striking of the Senegal on a Rock near Grand Canary', 'full_section_title': 'Misfortune upon Misfortune—Striking of the Senegal on a Rock near Grand Canary', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_06_1880', 'content': '**THE BLANTYRE MISSION, EAST AFRICA.**—Dr. Cameron, M.P., introduced Mr. Andrew Chirnside and Mr. King Hall to Sir Charles Dilke at the Foreign Office, a few days ago.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental.

The writer is anonymous, but appears to be an official of some kind, sent out at a later period than the men whom he puts in his terrible pillory. No one can read the diary without feeling convinced of its good faith, and its publication has made an immense stir in Germany. Englishmen have their own crimes against Natives to answer for, and no white race that has had to live with black races is blameless. The courage implied in the publication of such a document shows that German opinion is sound at heart, and all white peoples may learn how terrible are the dangers to which despotic rule over ""inferior"" races exposes the white man, and how essential it is never to relax the precautions against his demoralisation which experience has proved to be required:—\n\nMarch 13, 1893.—I hear some interesting particulars about the Bakoko rising. There are numerous inaccuracies in the official reports. Assessor Wehlau, the leader of the expedition, while the villages were burning, gave orders that some old women should have their throats cut; as for men, he could not take prisoners. Instead of the 150 prisoners of the official report, there were, according to my informant, only twelve or fifteen. Weary, wounded, half-starving, covered with bruises and sores, these few—mostly old women, greybeards, and children—were landed from the ship and beaten and shoved in fetters to the prison.

The coroner's inquest, which took place in July last, reveals a state of things more worthy of the most barbarous ages, than of the civilisation and sanitary advancement of the year 1868. The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying.

A case just tried at the Port Louis Assizes affords additional proof of this fact, while the circumstances connected with it show that public opinion in the colony is not, at present, favourable to any improvement in this state of things. From the evidence given at the trial it appears that a Frenchman named Tampier, an overseer on the estate of M. de Chazal, one of the most humane planters in the Mauritius, was visiting a field in which a number of labourers were employed, when being displeased with the manner in which one of the coolies performed his task, he struck the man, knocked him down, and, leaping upon his prostrate body, stamped and kicked until his passion expended its strength. The victim died of this treatment within half-an-hour. Notwithstanding this fact, the jury at Tampier\'s first trial could not agree as to their verdict. At the second trial for unpremeditated murder, the jury found the overseer guilty of a common assault, and strongly recommended him to mercy. The Court, however, sentenced him to the maximum penalty allowed by the Code Civile, namely, imprisonment with hard labour for twelve months. The malheureux enfant, as it had become the fashion to call the murderer, was quite overcome at the dreadful sentence, and the effect on the public (with the exception of the coolies) is thus described by a local journal: ""The jurymen walk slowly; they are literally overwhelmed.

On the 29th ult., Egbo runners, or masked men, perambulated the town, flogging and fining every one that they could catch. The subjects of this injustice did nothing, but the tyrants deem it necessary to maintain their own power to flog and fine innocent slaves. On the 3rd inst., the masked men went out, scattered the market, and seized much goods belonging to the poor people, which they took away. The tyrants in town, Orok and the three Archibong, got a missionary to their own liking to hold a meeting once a week in their yard. The first good result of this meeting was the issuing of a proclamation that all the dogs in town must be killed, because they spoil Orok\'s ju-ju. As our brave missionary said in church on the following Sabbath, ""The poor ignorant heathens in town sacrificed many dogs last week to devils."" The tyrants do not like Mr. Ross; they hate him as much as Ahab did Micaiah. After the meeting was over in Orok\'s yard, and the missionary away, he at once sacrificed fowls to his ju-ju. Archibong Ezo, son of Archibong II., not long ago flogged a woman to death. Archibong Adam, son of late Archibong III., flogged a boy most barbarously, and when the poor fellow was gasping most piteously, he threw him into the mangrove swamp, to be devoured by crocodiles. There is a respectable young man in town, of some property; the three Archibong boys, including the two murderers, put him in chains, and demanded all his people and property. The plea set up for this iniquitous demand was, that Okom Ma traded seventeen years for Archibong II., and six years for Archibong III., for which he never received any wages. This is a strange reward. The judges met to consider the matter, and allowed the boys to have the palaver all their own way. Okom Ma has appealed to Consul Hewett. Up to this time I have not heard that Consul Hewett settled a single palaver on the West Coast, except one in Old Calabar, where he took the part of a European against the natives. I know he does not strike awe into the natives, and command respect, as his predecessor did. I and many other natives most heartily concur with the suggestion of writers in the African Times for July, that Old Calabar, for the benefit of the oppressed, should be placed under British protection, and a petition to the Foreign Office to this effect is contemplated by the natives. The tyrants dread the day of the termination of their bloodshed, oppression, and robbery. British protection would justly deprive the Calabarees of their monopoly of direct trade with the surrounding tribes, which are ten times more numerous than they; would open up the inland country to the benefits of commerce and civilization, and would, undoubtedly, develop trade, as security to life and property always does.—I am, &c.,', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1881#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATED SIERRA LEONE BRITISH SUBJECTS AND SLAVE DEALING.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The publication of the official Correspondence relative to the case of the slave girl in whose murder at Onitsha on the Niger two coloured men, named John and Williams, formerly in the service of the Church Missionary Society, were implicated, is calculated to deepen the feeling of indignation with which that brutal crime was regarded by the public when the facts of the case were first made known. The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period. Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""In accordance with the general principle that local populations should defray the costs of measures calculated to enhance their material, social and intellectual progress, a poll tax of one shilling per head was instituted in 1852 and generally accepted, though only very briefly.$^{5}$ In fact, resistance to the tax soon became very strong, not so much because the officials responsible for tax collection were supplanting the chiefs, but because only 8 per cent of the revenue was used for schools and roads, most of it being used to pay the host of civil servants on administrative duties. Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further.

Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools. Having lost the traditionality of their positions and roles in the eyes of their people, they were treated in most cases like mere instruments of control by the colonial masters and not as real partners. The loss of real power and social status and prestige was a source of discontent for many of them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.587, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy. By the early twentieth century, these taxes were regularized as was no other colonial institution, having undergone what appears to be a clear cycle of development.$^{24}$ The 'hut' tax was an obvious form in the early years of domination and was also a source of considerable African con› tention and protest.$^{25}$ It was generally replaced by about the second decade of the twentieth century with a poll or capitation tax which remained the dominant form until the end of the colonial regime. Between the wars there were attempts to graduate this tax on a regional basis or on an assess› ment of the potential yield of the land.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""In the Gold Coast the leading political party until the ascendancy of Dr Kwame Nkrumah - the United Gold Coast Convention - represented some kind of rapprochement between the new and traditional elites.

I will give you an evidence of this. Mr. X., our Chief Magistrate, acts the part of counsel in every case where his friend Mr. Y. is concerned. This Mr. Y. is the agent here of Mr. A. (of — in England), the trustee and receiver of the estate of A., B., and Co., and C. and Co. From the moment Mr. X. landed here, Mr. Y. (knowing he has many cases to come before Mr. X. in one of which he is aware he has little or no grounds in) took care to give board and lodging to Mr. X., and they have become so intimate that, although Mr. X. has since procured his own lodgings a long way off, he has several times heard cases in chambers at Mr. Y.'s house, and in those cases Mr. Y. was plaintiff. One or two cases have been thus handled, Mr. X. acting more as counsel than as judge; so that the parties concerned would have appealed to the Sierra Leone Court of Appeal, had not an insuperable difficulty been in the way, which frightens poor or prudent traders from incurring the risks which they would otherwise run. I will give you one instance. A Mr. D. gave Mr. E. a bill of exchange on A., B., and Co., in 1872, for 150l. The bill was returned dishonoured. Mr. E. sued Mr. D., and obtained judgment from the then Chief Magistrate, Mr. F. Mr. E. issued a writ to recover 150l. from Mr. D. Mr. D. having accounts with A., B., and Co., pending settlement with Mr. Y., and Mr. E. owing A., B., and Co. 101l., Mr. D., in open court, requested Mr. Y. to debit his account with the 101l., and he would give Mr. E. the balance—viz., 49l. Mr. Y. agreed to this before Judge F., and ordered his clerk to give Mr. E. a receipt for 101l., which the Sheriff considered as partly satisfying the judgment debt of 150l., and therefore recovered from Mr. D. and paid Mr. E. only 49l. and the costs. Now Mr. Y. and Mr. D., six months after, came to settlement of account, and it was alleged that Mr. D. had to pay Mr. Y. a large balance. Mr. Y. now objected to Mr. D.'s account to Mr. E. of 101l., and sued Mr. E. for it. Mr. Magistrate X. would not look at the receipt of Mr. Y.'s clerk, produced by Mr. E., nor listen to any representation from Mr. E., but accepted Mr. Y.'s denial of all knowledge of it as true, although Mr. Y.'s clerk and the Sheriff could have been examined if the Judge would only have listened; but being aware that Mr. E. is not in a position to overcome the great barrier in the way of the Court of Appeal, took advantage of it and did his own way for his friend. I give you this simple detail of facts as a small proof of the evils resulting from having local Judges; and it would be a great blessing to us all if we could have Circuit Judges: although where Europeans and Africans are concerned in court, there will not always, perhaps, even then, be that fair impartiality in allowing for the African's defects in English in representing his case, yet there will be by far a better decision, where a gentleman is appointed as Judge, and is not, in any sense, resident.—Yours truly, L.

How they will justify their action to Lord Kimberley we cannot guess, but may know before very long. On looking carefully over the copy of the proceedings I have before me, I cannot say I think much of Gold Coast justice. The minds of those who acted as judges in the matter seemed to have been made up long beforehand; no argument could convince them, no protestations of innocence could avail anything; no falsehood, however obvious, or perjury, however flagrant, on the part of the authors of these trumped-up charges, could open their eyes; they seemed to have had one all-engrossing object in view, which was to be brought about at all hazards.\n\nThe substance of the whole case is as follows. In December, 1879, Mr. Maxwell had occasion to recommend to Mr. Ussher, the then Governor, the removal of a Mrs. Johnson, the Government Schoolmistress, as she and her husband were always fighting and quarrelling in a manner that attracted public attention, and was a disgrace to her as a public teacher. This report was forwarded to Mr. Ussher by a Mr. Hughes, then District Commissioner, who made comments approving of Mr. Maxwell's reports, and stating that he had had occasion to make several reports of her before, and adding that her husband had no good reputation in the town.\n\nThis report Mrs. Johnson met with a false counter-charge to the effect that the Colonial Chaplain reported her from revenge, as her husband observed him paying great attentions to her and prohibited him visiting them.

We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH AUTHORITY AT AXIM.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Gold Coast Times* has only anticipated us in the following:—\n\n""If only a portion of the rumours which reach us from Axim be well-founded, matters would seem to be getting a little \'mixed\' in that district, which, notwithstanding its daily growing importance, is so unaccountably neglected by the \'powers that be.\' It has long been a marvel to many that a district so extensive, and so rapidly rising into note, should be left to the administration of a young subordinate official, who has had no previous training or experience to qualify him for the post; and if things go on much longer as at present, very serious complications must arise, for which the Executive will be almost directly responsible, owing to its failure to place the administration of the gold-mining port and district in the hands of a staid, competent, experienced, and able gentleman.\n\n""If it be true that Sir Samuel Rowe is coming out again as Governor of the Gold Coast, it is much to be desired that he should touch at Axim.

Brown, head-master of Wesleyan Grammar School; James Davis, merchant, and Government Commissioner to native chiefs; John Christian, merchant. Never was there a more respectable educated jury empanelled on the Gold Coast. The case lasted five days, and at the end Mr. Chief-Magistrate Chalmers addressed the jury as if he were counsel for the prosecution. However, the jury were men of truth, and unanimously acquitted the prisoners. To describe the excitement that followed would be impossible. It came out in evidence that the first search-warrant issued by Mr. Chalmers had neither date nor seal, and the attorney for the prisoners made a good point of this great default; but Mr. Chalmers told the jury that it was perfectly in order; that as he had issued it from the Judicial Assessor's Court these mistakes or omissions did not signify, since he could do what he liked in that court; and that Governor McClean established a precedent to back up his ruling. Poor Fynn, his son, and Forson were kept in a beastly gaol for ten days. The so-called Colonel Foster-Foster, police magistrate, and prosecutor in this case, refused bail in 1,000l. for Fynn's and his fellow-prisoners' appearance; and at the trial they were honourably acquitted. The question now is, have the Fynns and Forson any remedy? Mr. Chalmers will continue in the same bad course, and poor Fynn will not receive a sixpence damage, except where so-called justice\n\nwould in such a case be the voice of a compromised executive. Their expenses have been nearly 130l. It appeared in evidence that the Acting-Administrator interfered with Colonel Foster whilst he was executing Mr. Chalmers' warrant, and ordered him a second time to go and fetch all Fynn's papers, though the warrant distinctly stated what papers were required. Foster could not find them. Salmon got in a rage, and ordered him to go again—hence all the trouble. Now what right had Mr. Salmon, as Administrator, to interfere in judicial matters? Surely Earl Granville has expressed himself plainly on the illegality of the executive interfering with judicial matters; but here, of course, all is exceptional. The Gold Coast is in a very unsettled and disorganised state, and through Mr. Salmon's culpable mismanagement.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

So strongly do we feel this, that we had intended to give a full review of the position this month. But although unable to do this, we cannot avoid noticing the facts contained in a letter from one of our correspondents there respecting certain proceedings in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court. The due and impartial administration of justice ought to be looked upon as a matter of the first consequence in a British colony or settlement. In the absence of a ""Secretary of State for the Department of Public Justice"" from the roll of British Ministers in Council, it devolves on the Colonial-office to be especially watchful and careful in this important matter. We believe that in a British colony or settlement, where there is no distinction of race, there will be found to prevail pretty generally such an administration of justice, because a community of British settlers will not bear to be trifled with in such things. But unhappily this is often far from being the case where the courts of justice are established principally for what is looked upon as an inferior race. We have seen too many examples of this. The sad outbreak in Jamaica was based upon the real or fancied oppression exercised by a district court, the decisions of which were taxed with partiality and consequently with injustice; and it is impossible for us to look with any satisfaction upon what is recorded in the above-mentioned letter as having taken place at Cape Coast. It must be borne in mind, too, that the circumstances at Cape Coast are exceptional, and exceptional in a particular which renders it tenfold more than ordinarily incumbent on the Colonial-office to provide against the possibility of any irregular proceedings or charge of injustice in the Cape Coast courts. Under the new decision of Downing-street, so far as we can gather these from facts and partial revelations, all that Cape Coast is to receive from Great Britain, in return for the customs and other duties, &c., exacted is an administration of justice—is the maintenance of open courts in which justice, in conformity with British law, shall be administered to colonists and natives. Yet, notwithstanding this, we had occasion to remark in past months on the seat of justice both in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court and in the Supreme Court being filled by officers of the West India Detachment quartered at Cape Coast Castle. Now this is in every respect indefensible. The Earl of Carnarvon (in his speech on the Jamaica question which appears in our columns), treating of courts-martial, says that ""these form at all times a very exceptional and very deplorable tribunal."" And why? Lord Carnarvon explains: ""No one will doubt this who considers the youth, the ignorance of the first principles of law, and very often the prejudices of their members."" We have eliminated what was irrelevant and inapplicable. And can any one doubt that these objections to the administration of justice by military officers are equally applicable when such officers are appointed to preside in the Supreme Court and the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court at Cape Coast, a locality in which, perhaps, because of peculiar climate, passions and prejudices seem to interfere, even under the most favourable circumstances, with the impartial administration of justice? Soon after this journal was established, four or five years since, we insisted on the necessity of some new arrangements at Cape Coast as regards official residence. We said then, and we say now, that the judges and magistrates ought not to be residents in the Castle with the Governor and military officers. A judge ought to be beyond the suspicion of partiality or bias, if his decisions are to be respected; and we are sorry to see that the Colonial-office have not made any change in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'State of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again, with the poorer condition of the natives, Bushmen and the like.

But no Government at all is preferable to the existing farce. The natives generally prefer to be under a European Government—that of England first, that is supposed to be strict to all alike, and to administer justice without delay. I repeat, that they would submit to much of what in other parts ought be termed grinding tyranny, provided they see it consistently practised and justly meted out to all alike; and, above all, they like a Government that is able to protect, as well as to punish, and one that can punish offenders in Akim and Aquapim as well as in Accra and Cape Coast.\n\nThe natives of these parts, chiefs and people, are exceedingly tractable and submissive to the authority of the whites, moreover, patient and long-suffering. There is also a good understanding always between the European merchants and the native chiefs and principal people, who listen to the advice of the former.

I cannot, however, refrain from telling the Colonel, through you, that there is really a very serious amount of discontent (to use a mild term) in these settlements among all classes of the people, and this feeling is likely to be greatly increased by a step which his Excellency has lately taken. He has made prisoner Quakoo Ganin, the Ashantee refugee, who fled to Cape Coast Castle for protection in 1863, and he has decided on sending him to Sierra Leone. This has been done, as I positively know, by advice of the agent of a certain London firm, whose power on the Coast has hitherto been paramount.

Although if all the statements in letter No. 1 be true, there would seem to have been some negligence or oversight on Governor Pine\'s part, and we should, therefore, were we in a similar position, have preferred to invite or request Commodore Wilmot to hold the said court, we have nevertheless every reason to believe that, under Governor Pine, the inquiry will be impartially conducted.

We have before us some of the complaints that have been made on this head to Her Majesty's authorities at Quittah, and the replies of Captain Graves. The complainants allege that the said rum, &c., so seized, confiscated, and sold was seized respectively seven, and even ten miles from the sea-coast, and therefore without British jurisdiction; while Captain Graves' replies are to the effect that the seizures have taken place within British jurisdiction, and that the goods have been rightfully condemned and sold.

There were many reasons, and very serious ones, why this was imperatively called for. Because the Fort at Quitta got into grievous disrepair some ten years ago, the small detachment of West India troops until that time stationed there was withdrawn. The natives then fell gradually under the influence of Ashanti, with whom they formed alliance; and to whom they were of essential use in the supply of arms and munitions of war, as well as of many useful articles. We dare not say much about the slave sales of boys and girls which they also made there, seeing that similar atrocities were permitted at Cape Coast, where the British Government had its chief seat of authority. Having an immunity from the import duties which were levied at all the ports on the western side of the Volta by the British authorities, these trans-Volta districts enjoyed advantages in trade, which led to the settlement of not a few traders there. The accounts which reached us from time to time were of a very unsatisfactory nature; strongly elucidating that, however satisfactory these trading operations in native territory might be to men or firms who made themselves powerful, and could sufficiently bribe the native kings and chiefs, they were far from being so to the weaker traders, who, when wronged (and this was of but too frequent occurrence), were entirely at their mercy, and almost hopeless of obtaining redress. It was with the utmost satisfaction, therefore, that we learned of the extension of British authority, occupation, and rule to these districts, as recognized integral portions of the new Gold Coast Colony. It would have been unfair to the countries west of the Volta, that they should be subject to heavy import duties on certain articles, while their neighbours on the east side of that river, and trading with the same people in the interior, were free from such duties. We naturally expected that the imposition of duties at Jellah Coffee, Quitta, &c., would at first cause some dissatisfaction; but we believed this would be but transient, and that counterbalancing advantages derived from the presence of British authority, if that authority were judiciously exercised, would soon reconcile all the hitherto oppressed and wronged; whatever it might do with the oppressors and wrongdoers, who would naturally dislike the curb thus placed in their mouths, to restrain them in the indulgence of their unjust greediness. The first account we have received of proceedings in the Court of the British Civil Commandant, fully justifies the expectations we entertained. We do not know anything of the parties concerned, or of the merits of the dispute between them. All we can see is, that the one who had been placed in log by native authority, has had judgment in his favour by the British Commandant after a patient hearing; and that the decision was received with joy by the natives, who felt grateful to the Queen for having sent her authority among them. It is not difficult to understand this. The native courts everywhere are well understood to be subservient to those who can pay best, as against those who cannot afford to pay. The weak find little or no protection in them; and the change from this to the decision in a British court, in cases where there cannot, by any possibility, be a suspicion or charge of undue partiality on the part of the magistrate or judge, must commend itself to the public sentiment. We feel that there must be a great arrear of unredressed wrong, of postponed justice, in these trans-Volta seaports; and we expect to hear of many other cases not essentially differing from that of Bruce v. Williams. There are not any powerful English firms there, whose influence might be supposed, as sometimes at Cape Coast and Lagos, to warp and bias the mind of the presiding judicial authority; and we have, therefore, every reason to expect decisions in disputed cases, which will give general satisfaction; together with a feeling of security on the part of the weaker members of the community, which will be well worth the payment of regulated Customs' duties, and be, indeed, thus very cheaply purchased. All that will be wanting there, as in the older settlements, will be the occasional visits of a Circuit Judge, who would correct any error into which the local authority may have fallen. We rejoice over this extension of British authority among the sea-coast populations between the River Volta, and the territory of Dahomey, and look for a great tide of prosperity, and advance of civilization in those districts."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nKotobarbie, near Accra, May 21, 1867.\n\nDear Sir,—I wrote you lately informing you of the Governor-General\'s call at Accra, _en route_ to Lagos on his annual official visit.

This context aligns with the claim about concerns over impartiality and fairness, as Maclean's dual role could compromise the separation of powers. The introduction of English legal principles and the use of local militias to enforce new laws further support the notion of dual roles. However, the textbook does not explicitly discuss concerns about impartiality or fairness, nor does it directly address the separation of powers. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim by highlighting instances where individuals held multiple incompatible offices, such as Mr. Barry, who served simultaneously as Queen's Advocate, Acting Chief Justice, and Acting Colonial Secretary. This accumulation of roles led to situations where the same person acted as both prosecutor and judge, raising questions about the impartiality of justice. The articles also discuss the influence of personal relationships and hospitality on judicial decisions, further undermining the perception of fairness, and criticize the practice of military officers presiding over courts due to their lack of legal training. These details from The African Times align with the claim by illustrating how the lack of separation of powers and the concentration of judicial authority in a few individuals compromised the integrity of the legal system on the Gold Coast.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

All these measures which gave the traditional rulers powers to collect revenue and to impose court fines as were unknown before, were, according to Stone, 'an attempt to make the chiefs a living part of the machinery of (colonial) government'. Economically, the era saw the alternation of periods of boom with those of recession and inflation - the latter in 1915-17, 1929-30 and the second half of the 1930s. It also saw the spread of the cocoa industry into the rural areas especially of Akuapem and Akyem Abuakwa which led to the emergence of an increasing number of rich young farmers and long-distance traders. Socially, the period also saw the spread of elementary education into the rural areas and while some of the products of these schools drifted into the urban centres, others stayed behind and took to either farming or petty trading. With all these changes in their socio› economic status, these rural people began to demand a corresponding change in their political status and especially representation on the state and provincial councils, a demand which the ordinances mentioned above made steadily impossible. The principal objectives of the rural folk, then, were to acquire representation on these councils and, above all, to curb the increasing powers of their traditional rulers and the district commis› sioners and abolition or reduction of some of the fines and taxes being imposed by them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.597, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""In this document, fees and fines being imposed by the traditional rulers were reduced and regulations for their imposition were laid down; the Okwahuman Council was also to be made a truly representative body of chiefs and commoners and failure to attend was to be made punishable by fine.

Trade in foodstuffs was to be centralized in certain towns, a detailed list of market prices and trade fees was to be drawn up, the export of fish and game from Kwahu was prohibited and rules governing marriages, family responsibilities in debt cases, funerals, adultery by chiefs, etc., were laid down. As J. Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period. Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

With the adoption of the principle of the sanctity of national boundaries by the Organization of African Unity, this appearance is not likely to be altered. Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads. But colonial rulers were compelled to restore African independence and sovereignty, as will be seen in the next volume, not to the traditional ruling elite but to the new elite or members of the upper and lower middle classes, the creation of the colonial system, and this situation is never going to be reversed. If anything, the chances of African traditional regal institutions being abolished altogether, as for example they have been in Guinea, are much greater than their retention let alone their rehabilitation. Thirdly, it was colonialism that gave birth to African nationalism which was the product of the sense of anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and alienation generated by the colonial system. Fourthly, one colonial legacy which again has already played such a decisive role in the politics of post-colonial Africa is the army. This institution is not likely to be abolished and, as will be seen in the next volume, it has already changed the course of the history of many an African country, and it seems as if it has not completed its political innings yet.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Youth Leagues and Movements', 'content': 'Such certainly were the demands made by the Gold Coast Youth Con› ference at its first meeting in Accra organized by Danquah in 1929.\nThe demands made by the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM) were similar.

Economic changes in the nineteenth century affected the pattern of authority not only in terms of the structures of the state systems, but often in strengthening such existing non-political integrative structures as well."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Occasionally African producers defended their interests collectively through hold-ups (refusals to deliver produce to market).

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta.

One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon.

But it is at the Gold Coast that these evils have become most prominent, and have been most compromising, as regards the British official character and the purity of administration; and the loading with incompatible offices a gentleman who, however talented and estimable he may be, was quite new to official life, necessarily challenged remark from us, as the only public organ that represents Africa with the British public, and Great Britain with the Africans.\n\nThat the offices thus accumulated could not be properly held by one and the same individual at any one time, will very clearly appear when we state that the holder of one of them cannot, while charged with its duties, sit in the Council, while the holder of another of them becomes, in virtue of the office, a prominent and influential member of that Council.

There is something which in our eyes is far more serious. In the administration of justice it is of the very highest importance that there should be not only an absence of all bias on the part of the judge, but also an absence of everything that could afford even the slightest ground for an imputation of partiality or predecision. The judge should not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. What, then, can be urged in favour or excuse of an arrangement by which an individual is, in his capacity of Queen’s advocate, the public and official prosecutor, and sits also as judge, in his capacity as acting chief justice, for the trial of the very causes he has, as Queen’s advocate, promoted and undertaken to substantiate? Surely this is a most flagrant impropriety; and we cannot be surprised that observers should challenge the purity and impartiality of justice thus administered or maladministered.

Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Legislative Council and Administration of Justice on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As these two persons transact very extensive business with a great many people on the Coast, they have almost daily to sit in court on their own cases; and would you credit it, Sir, both frequently give decrees in their own favour? and in consequence of the very close relations existing between them, especially the principal agent, and our most esteemed Governor, people dare not complain when any glaring act of injustice is committed by one of them, although I am quite sure that the Governor would never allow any friendship to bias him in a matter of public justice.

Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How Justice is Administered on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—In your deep interest for Africa, you will excuse my saying that you cannot possibly insist too much upon the point you have dwelt upon in your two last issues—viz., the mode of the administration of justice in the new Government of the Gold Coast; for I am certain you must have heard often from other sources how great maladministration has been in time past, lately, and is even now practised by local magistrates. I will give you an evidence of this. Mr. X., our Chief Magistrate, acts the part of counsel in every case where his friend Mr. Y. is concerned. This Mr. Y. is the agent here of Mr. A. (of — in England), the trustee and receiver of the estate of A., B., and Co., and C. and Co. From the moment Mr. X. landed here, Mr. Y. (knowing he has many cases to come before Mr. X. in one of which he is aware he has little or no grounds in) took care to give board and lodging to Mr. X., and they have become so intimate that, although Mr. X. has since procured his own lodgings a long way off, he has several times heard cases in chambers at Mr. Y.'s house, and in those cases Mr. Y. was plaintiff. One or two cases have been thus handled, Mr. X. acting more as counsel than as judge; so that the parties concerned would have appealed to the Sierra Leone Court of Appeal, had not an insuperable difficulty been in the way, which frightens poor or prudent traders from incurring the risks which they would otherwise run. I will give you one instance. A Mr. D. gave Mr. E. a bill of exchange on A., B., and Co., in 1872, for 150l. The bill was returned dishonoured. Mr. E. sued Mr. D., and obtained judgment from the then Chief Magistrate, Mr. F. Mr. E. issued a writ to recover 150l. from Mr. D. Mr. D. having accounts with A., B., and Co., pending settlement with Mr. Y., and Mr. E. owing A., B., and Co. 101l., Mr. D., in open court, requested Mr. Y. to debit his account with the 101l., and he would give Mr. E. the balance—viz., 49l. Mr. Y. agreed to this before Judge F., and ordered his clerk to give Mr. E. a receipt for 101l., which the Sheriff considered as partly satisfying the judgment debt of 150l., and therefore recovered from Mr. D. and paid Mr. E. only 49l. and the costs. Now Mr. Y. and Mr. D., six months after, came to settlement of account, and it was alleged that Mr. D. had to pay Mr. Y. a large balance. Mr. Y. now objected to Mr. D.'s account to Mr. E. of 101l., and sued Mr. E. for it. Mr. Magistrate X. would not look at the receipt of Mr. Y.'s clerk, produced by Mr. E., nor listen to any representation from Mr. E., but accepted Mr. Y.'s denial of all knowledge of it as true, although Mr. Y.'s clerk and the Sheriff could have been examined if the Judge would only have listened; but being aware that Mr. E. is not in a position to overcome the great barrier in the way of the Court of Appeal, took advantage of it and did his own way for his friend. I give you this simple detail of facts as a small proof of the evils resulting from having local Judges; and it would be a great blessing to us all if we could have Circuit Judges: although where Europeans and Africans are concerned in court, there will not always, perhaps, even then, be that fair impartiality in allowing for the African's defects in English in representing his case, yet there will be by far a better decision, where a gentleman is appointed as Judge, and is not, in any sense, resident.—Yours truly, L.

So strongly do we feel this, that we had intended to give a full review of the position this month. But although unable to do this, we cannot avoid noticing the facts contained in a letter from one of our correspondents there respecting certain proceedings in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court. The due and impartial administration of justice ought to be looked upon as a matter of the first consequence in a British colony or settlement. In the absence of a ""Secretary of State for the Department of Public Justice"" from the roll of British Ministers in Council, it devolves on the Colonial-office to be especially watchful and careful in this important matter. We believe that in a British colony or settlement, where there is no distinction of race, there will be found to prevail pretty generally such an administration of justice, because a community of British settlers will not bear to be trifled with in such things. But unhappily this is often far from being the case where the courts of justice are established principally for what is looked upon as an inferior race. We have seen too many examples of this. The sad outbreak in Jamaica was based upon the real or fancied oppression exercised by a district court, the decisions of which were taxed with partiality and consequently with injustice; and it is impossible for us to look with any satisfaction upon what is recorded in the above-mentioned letter as having taken place at Cape Coast. It must be borne in mind, too, that the circumstances at Cape Coast are exceptional, and exceptional in a particular which renders it tenfold more than ordinarily incumbent on the Colonial-office to provide against the possibility of any irregular proceedings or charge of injustice in the Cape Coast courts. Under the new decision of Downing-street, so far as we can gather these from facts and partial revelations, all that Cape Coast is to receive from Great Britain, in return for the customs and other duties, &c., exacted is an administration of justice—is the maintenance of open courts in which justice, in conformity with British law, shall be administered to colonists and natives. Yet, notwithstanding this, we had occasion to remark in past months on the seat of justice both in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court and in the Supreme Court being filled by officers of the West India Detachment quartered at Cape Coast Castle. Now this is in every respect indefensible. The Earl of Carnarvon (in his speech on the Jamaica question which appears in our columns), treating of courts-martial, says that ""these form at all times a very exceptional and very deplorable tribunal."" And why? Lord Carnarvon explains: ""No one will doubt this who considers the youth, the ignorance of the first principles of law, and very often the prejudices of their members."" We have eliminated what was irrelevant and inapplicable. And can any one doubt that these objections to the administration of justice by military officers are equally applicable when such officers are appointed to preside in the Supreme Court and the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court at Cape Coast, a locality in which, perhaps, because of peculiar climate, passions and prejudices seem to interfere, even under the most favourable circumstances, with the impartial administration of justice? Soon after this journal was established, four or five years since, we insisted on the necessity of some new arrangements at Cape Coast as regards official residence. We said then, and we say now, that the judges and magistrates ought not to be residents in the Castle with the Governor and military officers. A judge ought to be beyond the suspicion of partiality or bias, if his decisions are to be respected; and we are sorry to see that the Colonial-office have not made any change in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Special Government Inquiry into Official Conduct on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Finlason, as already announced in another leader, is at liberty. While he was yet in the power of his vindictive and unscrupulous enemies our chief efforts were directed to his liberation. We did not, however, neglect to make others for those who were involved in later extraordinary proceedings on the part of the Gold Coast authorities, but at the end of the month of June, and since, have urged strongly upon Her Majesty’s Government the absolute necessity of a general inquiry by Sir Arthur Kennedy, as Governor-in-Chief (or some other authority equally independent, and invested with sufficient power to protect all those who should give evidence before him), relative to official proceedings, administrative and judicial, on the Gold Coast since the appointment of Mr. Ussher as Administrator, and Mr. Parker as Chief Magistrate and Assessor. We have shown that such is the reign of terror actually existing there, that it would be absurd to expect individuals should volunteer, or in any way give evidence inculpating official persons, while those persons retained the uncontrolled power to effect their ruin. And we now publicly urge the immediate institution of such inquiry by his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, who, as we are informed, is entrusted with ample power for the purpose. The accusations against officials at Cape Coast of inefficiency, general misconduct, waste of the public revenues, and an arbitrary and excessive abuse of power, so that no one who incurs official displeasure is safe, either as regards person or property, are so heavy and numerous that it is due to the officials themselves, as well as to the public on the Gold Coast, and to the honour of Her Majesty’s rule, that such a Court of Inquiry should be at once opened. If there had been any doubt previously as to the absolute necessity of this Court of Inquiry, it must, we think, have been removed by the following assertion said to have been made by Judge Parker in his Court at Cape Coast on the 6th July, when he concluded a long tirade against the “half-educated lawyers” pleading before him by saying, “I WAS TOLD AT THE COLONIAL-OFFICE THAT I MIGHT PUT ALL LAW ON ONE SIDE, AND DO AS I PLEASED IN MY COURT.” These words, we are assured, were taken down at the time by Mr. Bartels and Mr. Blankson, the pleaders, and other persons in the Court. Under such circumstances it is of course useless for us to clamour against proceedings, judgments, and sentences in that Court as illegal, and to ask for the statutes under which they may have been supposed to be justified. Supposing it, as we have every reason to do, to be correct and capable of proof that Judge Parker made use of these words, here we have at once a direct issue between Judge Parker and the Colonial-office in England. And it is not an indifferent or unimportant issue. We deny the power of any Secretary of State for the Colonies to hand over the people in any one of Her Majesty’s settlements abroad to the unlimited power of any man as magistrate or judge, whoever that man may be. That would be the very way to make a Judge Jeffreys in such a settlement as that of the Gold Coast; and we dare not believe that the Earl of Carnarvon, who appointed Judge Parker to Cape Coast, could have so exceeded the powers with which he was entrusted by Her Majesty for the welfare of the people in the colonies and dependencies.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-08-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_08_1868#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

I cannot, however, refrain from telling the Colonel, through you, that there is really a very serious amount of discontent (to use a mild term) in these settlements among all classes of the people, and this feeling is likely to be greatly increased by a step which his Excellency has lately taken. He has made prisoner Quakoo Ganin, the Ashantee refugee, who fled to Cape Coast Castle for protection in 1863, and he has decided on sending him to Sierra Leone. This has been done, as I positively know, by advice of the agent of a certain London firm, whose power on the Coast has hitherto been paramount.

1349,"Colonial Africa's legal systems were heavily influenced and controlled by British judicial authorities, reflecting broader imperial dominance through the establishment of courts and appointments of British judges to enforce colonial law and order.","The claim that Colonial Africa's legal systems were heavily influenced and controlled by British judicial authorities is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though each source provides a nuanced perspective. The General History of Africa textbook highlights the introduction of European legal systems, including British, with some adaptation to local contexts, such as the incorporation of African customary law in 'native courts' under Lugard's administration, modified only where it conflicted with fundamental English norms. This suggests a complex interaction involving both imposition and adaptation, with the British model influencing other colonial powers like the Belgians, while the French and Portuguese systems differed, particularly in their use of indigenous authorities. Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the establishment of courts and the appointment of British judges, such as Sir James Marshall and H. W. Macleod, to enforce colonial law and order, illustrating British control. The articles also critique the administration of justice, noting issues like the abolition of trial by jury in civil cases and British influence in local courts, while acknowledging local resistance and dissatisfaction, which complicates the narrative of smooth British dominance. Together, these sources depict a colonial legal landscape marked by significant British influence, yet characterized by regional diversity and contested imposition.","The General History of Africa textbook provides a nuanced view of the colonial legal systems, highlighting both the influence of European judicial institutions and the adaptation to local contexts. While the claim suggests a broad imperial dominance by British judicial authorities, the textbook indicates that European legal systems, including British, were introduced with some consideration of African customary law and Muslim law. The British model of 'native courts' under Lugard's administration aimed to incorporate African customary law, modified only where it conflicted with fundamental English norms. This suggests a more complex interaction than the claim implies, as it involved both imposition and adaptation. Furthermore, the textbook notes that the British approach was emulated by other colonial powers, such as the Belgians, indicating a broader European influence rather than solely British dominance. Additionally, the textbook discusses the French and Portuguese systems, which differed from the British approach, particularly in their direct use of indigenous authorities. Therefore, while British influence was significant, the textbook portrays a more diverse and regionally varied colonial legal landscape than the claim suggests.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that Colonial Africa's legal systems were heavily influenced and controlled by British judicial authorities. The articles frequently mention the establishment of courts and the appointment of British judges to enforce colonial law and order. For instance, the articles discuss the creation of a Supreme Court of Appeal in Sierra Leone to oversee appeals from other West African settlements, highlighting the central role of British judicial structures. Additionally, the articles describe the appointment of British judges, such as Sir James Marshall and H. W. Macleod, to key judicial positions in the colonies, further illustrating British control over the legal systems. The articles also critique the administration of justice, pointing out issues like the abolition of trial by jury in civil cases and the influence of British officials in local courts, which aligns with the broader theme of imperial dominance. However, the articles also highlight some local resistance and dissatisfaction with the British legal system, such as complaints about partiality and incompetence in the courts, which adds nuance to the claim by showing that the imposition of British legal systems was not always smooth or uncontested. Overall, the articles provide a rich context that both supports and complicates the claim of British judicial influence in Colonial Africa.",True,1349,Colonial Administration,Judicial and Legal Reforms under Colonial Administrations,"[{'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Beyond the official rhetoric, the mundane purposes of colonization turned out to be quite limited. In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

The administration in the Belgian Congo was especially hostile to Islam and saw in it a threat to its 'Christianizing' and 'civilizing' mission. Only a few mosques were allowed to be built and there was a total ban on Muslim schools in the colony. 20 Other Europeans, especially the French, attempted to impose European culture on their subjects, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, believing that they had an obligation to raise the standard of their colonial subjects by imparting to them the 'benefits' of French culture.

Lastly, there was the income tax, introduced in the 1920s into several British territories and the Belgian Congo, but then primarily affecting non-Africans who generally were the only ones with sufficient income to be required to pay it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 464, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': 'In our last number we announced the marriage of Miss Blackall, daughter of his Excellency the Governor of Sierra Leone, with the Hon.

A few remarks may be necessary in explanation. In criminal cases the question submitted to the jury upon the evidence is a very simple one—viz., ""Whether the prisoner be guilty or not guilty;"" and in well-conducted prosecutions the whole of the evidence bears upon that point. Further, qualified jurors are usually persons of some property, and they have an interest in the repression of crime, and in giving security to life and property by their verdicts. In civil suits the case is somewhat different. These suits are usually actions arising out of commercial transactions and complicated accounts. The issues raised by the pleadings are oftentimes many and various. The litigating parties, if not on friendly terms with the jurors, are generally well known to them. And the opposing attorneys, contending for success and for their costs, not infrequently bewilder and distract them by the mass of matter they adduce in evidence in the hope of influencing them in their verdict. Add to all this the advocacy of these attorneys, without any public opinion to check them in their course, and the jealousies existing between the different races and tribes inhabiting these settlements, and it is not to be wondered at that verdicts in civil suits on this coast should have given less satisfaction than verdicts in criminal cases. With the right of appeal given by these Ordinances, and the provisions before referred to for taking down the evidence by the officer of the court, I think the decision of civil suits may be safely left to the resident magistrates at the other settlements, and to the judges of the Supreme Court at Sierra Leone, without a jury.\n\n[Here follows the celebrated Ordinance No. IV., 1866, 16th November, already published in *African Times*, vide January, 1867.]\n\n*Extract from Governor-General Blackall to Secretary of State, December 8, 1866.*'}, {'id': 1263, 'article_title': 'Administration of Justice at Cape Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Administration of Justice at Cape Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1867#article-25', 'issue_date': '23_12_1867', 'content': 'This cause was entered in the Supreme Court, Sir W.

I had occasion to attend, and the honest people of Lagos have much to lament at the support of disreputable characters. A man by the name of Nathaniel Thomas Babington Shepherd, who has been, form what was said in court, going to prison for felony since 1863 under various charges, has set up a kind of court in his house at Itolo Offin, in Lagos, and keeps bailiffs; and thereto his fellows, who give him cases, resort; he saying that he is a Solicitor of the Supreme Court—exacting fees, &c. He was arrested under different charges, and has been, in some, committed for trial. In court, we heard a white man, from Manchester, named G. E. Moss—a local made practitioner, whose licence, it is said, has to be renewed every six months—give evidence that this Shepherd is in his employ, and but for Shepherd, he could not get on in Lagos that Shepherd is his right hand man! Since Shepherd was apprehended and put in prison, Moss and other friends of Shepherd have laboured hard, and got him bailed out till his trial. Shepherd is defended by Mr. Moss and Mr. Christopher Williams; but on the part of the Crown, there is no Public Prosecutor, and, the Solicitors took advantage of this to bully and frighten the poor suffering witnesses for the Crown. The District Commissioner, Captain Bastow, is in their hands, and it is feared some of the cases have broken down for want of a proper person to prosecute. Mr. Moss felt very sore at Shepherd being found out, and, in revenge, he has got up a petition against the judicial authorities in some grand way, especially as regards the posts of Judge and Registrar, as he could not control the present holders of those offices to suit his purpose, and is disappointed at not being appointed to any post in the Government. We fail to know his position in Manchester; but if he was such a great man as he fancies himself here, what a pity he left home to make his living among Africans! It is nothing for him to say, ""I shall see the Governor!"" ""Oh, I have seen the Governor, and I told him thus and thus, and he is going to do it.""

If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**"", 'last_edit_date': '1868-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BATHURST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—Owing to the great abuses reported repeatedly by ""The Gambian,"" and the gross injustice that has prevailed in the Gambia courts, one Mr. Reffie has been sent over to England by the black inhabitants of the River Gambia to study law, in order that he may be in some degree qualified to defend his fellow-countrymen from the injustice to which they are from time to time compelled to submit in the court of that colony.\n\nThe weight of the one branch of the Gambia law is equal to a waggon burden; but we shall still despair of obtaining justice if merchants and their clerks are to continue to be the magistrates and commissioners in their courts. What will the plea of a defendant avail, where the plaintiff sits on the bench as commissioner? How, and in what way, can a prisoner expect justice, where he is to be tried by the complainant? How, then, can justice be pursued in such court, where the plaintiffs and complainants, or their clerks, are to sit on the bench as magistrates and commissioners, to decide upon their own suits or charges? Here are three among the many great obstacles which stand in the way of justice in the Gambia court, and unless they be removed, things will never get on well in the colony, as you and Christian England would wish.

For instance, say the Secretary\'s department for one; five offices (including the Collector of Custom\'s branch) and the hire of the building cost 2,080l. a year (not including the subordinates). Really, you will agree with me that it is rather exorbitant for the part keeping up of only one department per annum in so small a colony as the Gambia; and more so, as the five officers are not all Europeans, who have received a sound English education, but mere boys, who even have not completed their African schooling.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Council of the Royal Niger Company have taken an important step which will certainly commend itself as judicious to all acquainted with West Africa. They have appointed Sir James Marshall, C.M.G.—the well-known and universally respected late Chief Justice of the Gold Coast—to the post of [Chief Justice of the territories of the Company. It is also announced that Mr. W. H. Kelke, of the Chancery Bar, has accepted a Puisne Judgeship. The appointment of Sir James Marshall affords a very satisfactory proof that the Council are fully alive to the serious duties and responsibilities attaching to the vast work they have undertaken. They have unquestionably shown great energy and administrative ability during the past five or six years in securing to Great Britain the basin of the Lower and Middle Niger, and in checkmating the efforts of rival nations in those regions; but energy and executive capacity alone are not sufficient for good government. When Great Britain, by the grant of a Royal Charter, endorsed the sovereign powers which the Company had obtained from the native States, very natural doubts were expressed in some quarters whether the judicial administration was likely to rise to the level necessary in these days of universal publicity and seaching criticism. It was therefore with great satisfaction that the public read the statement of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons last Session, that the Company were conducting their affairs in a judicious manner under circumstances of great difficulty. The present selection of the principal judicial officer is a satisfactory confirmation of this view. Sir James Marshall was not only an excellent Chief Justice, but he had previously had many years' experience as Chief Magistrate and Judicial Assessor to the native chiefs. In this capacity he won their confidence to so high a degree that Sir Garnet Wolseley, in the Ashanti Expedition of 1874, requested him to take the field with the Cape Coast levies. Later on, Captain (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, arriving with a large detachment of troops, relieved him; but in a few days he asked Sir Garnet Wolseley to send him back Mr. Marshall, as the latter alone could manage the natives.

These have jurisdiction in cases of debt or crime at the British settlements. The chiefs in the interior also are ordered to refer their disputes with each other to Cape Coast, and to answer there any charges brought against them by the Government. In ordinary cases they submit. It is cheaper for them to do so than to resist. But in consequence of the absence of territorial right beyond the narrow limits of the forts and settlements, judges and magistrates holding their authority from the British Crown are placed in the disgraceful and dishonouring position of being compelled to use their authority for the enforcement of native laws diametrically at variance with those of Great Britain. Under their mandate, runaway slaves are delivered up to their masters; and every wife and concubine, be it remembered, is a slave! We have lately seen in our columns under what circumstances of atrocity this had been done at Accra. British authorities do at the Gold Coast, under orders from England—which it would be impossible to justify—what, if done elsewhere without orders, would subject them to criminal prosecution and severe punishment. British authority is thus made the minister and upholder of slavery, polygamy, and other atrocities of heathenism and barbarism; too often even, it is to be feared, the involuntary abettor of murder and superstitious human sacrifice. Meanwhile, with a few honourable exceptions, the British employés, civil and military, as well as mercantile agents, have acted as if they were sent out to carry on a propaganda of drunkenness and debauchery. The climate, and the necessities which the climate is supposed to engender, have been urged and seemingly admitted, as an excuse for every kind of vicious excess. We have a host of concurrent testimony that the greater portion of the deaths which have occurred among Europeans in these settlements, and elsewhere on the West Coast, have been not from climate per se, but from climate acting upon persons improperly selected, brought from other enervating climates (such as the West Indies, &c.), with constitutions impaired, or upon systems vitiated and enfeebled by abominable impurity and dissipation. It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents. According to the custom of the country, these are marriages; but the Europeans contracting these alliances consider them as only a temporary convenience; and for the most part, when they leave the Coast to return to England, not only are the women abandoned, but the children born of them also, without any provision being made for them, and seemingly without remorse on the part of him who leaves them.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Debtors’ Relief Ordinance for the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""One of the evils attendant on the course pursued as regards the application of English law to the British settlements on the West Coast of Africa has just now come prominently before us; and we are so firmly convinced of the desire of Her Majesty’s Government that equal justice shall be administered to all classes in those settlements, that we feel sure it is only necessary for us to point out the particular evil now requiring remedy to cause that remedy to be immediately applied. There must manifestly be great risk of injustice being perpetrated under the name and form of law, when only a part, instead of the whole, of the English system is introduced in a British settlement. The course pursued on the West Coast has been for the respective Legislative Councils (formed of Crown officials and other Government nominees) to pass ordinances from time to time, applying certain portions of the home laws to the settlements in which they might be exercising jurisdiction. In this way the British laws for the recovery of debts have been introduced in all the West Coast Settlements; and, as ought to have been considered a necessary consequence, the English laws for the relief of debtors have been subsequently introduced also, in all the colonies and settlements, excepting that of the River Gambia. This exception is the evil of which we complain, and which calls for prompt and immediate remedy. The English laws and form of procedure for the recovery of debt, and the old English laws of imprisonment for debt, are stringently applied at Bathurst; but there is no relief there for the insolvent debtor, as in England; the incarcerated debtor must remain in prison year after year, until death releases him, or his creditors relent and give him freedom. This partial application of English law is now producing results greatly to be deprecated. Under it, a gross and grinding and atrocious tyranny is exercised—a tyranny aggravated by the nature of the general mercantile transactions of the colony. The great trade of the River is that in ground-nuts. This trade is principally carried on by educated natives of Bathurst with the native producers in the upper part of the River. These educated natives, without whose intermediation between the British import houses and the native producers, the trade could not be carried on, are not possessed of the capital necessary to enable them to purchase imported goods of the importing merchants for purposes of barter, and subsequently to sell the ground-nuts to them. They have, therefore, to take the goods for barter from the merchants, at the merchants' prices, as agents, with the responsibility of principals. They are charged with the goods they take up the River for barter, at prices which may possibly enable them, in a very good ground-nut season, and barring accidents and plunder by marauding tribes (for there is no efficient British protection up the River), to cover their expenses and realise a small sum for the support of their families; but, practically, the result is, that the unfortunate trader is always in debt to the merchant—is hopelessly his slave—and, in the event of his desiring emancipation from this thraldom, or claiming for himself and his fellows equal protection and advantages with the merchant under British rule, he is proceeded against in the court of law for the balance alleged to be standing against him, has, almost as a matter of course, judgment pronounced against him, and from that moment becomes a hopeless and helpless victim of injustice under the name of law, to be locked up or allowed to be at large only at the will and caprice of his creditor. Now this is so repugnant to British law, to justice and equity—is so great a bar, so insuperable an obstacle to that native progress which the late committee of the House of Commons looked forward to for enabling the government to be carried on by the agency of educated natives in the West Coast Settlements—that, as we have before said, we feel that it is only necessary to bring it thus under the notice of Her Majesty’s Government to cause the adoption of some immediate measures by the Colonial-office for putting a stop to the grievous oppression under which the educated native traders in the River Gambia are now suffering. It would have been easy for us, and would have been our duty, had we not this conviction as regards the Colonial-office, to show how infamously the law has been of late set in action by one of the resident merchants for personal motives, hatreds, and interest, to the oppression of educated natives who have dared to aspire to an equality of rights, as British subjects, with the more opulent import and export merchants; but as it is always with the most extreme reluctance that we expose an offender, we abstain from any further remarks at present, and venture to express boldly the hope that it will be rendered altogether unnecessary, by his Grace the Secretary of State for the Colonies, or by Sir Arthur Kennedy, in his capacity of Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, ordering the immediate promulgation of an ordinance at the Gambia for putting in force there the English Bankrupt and Insolvency Laws, to be administered there as at Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, &c., with this proviso, that as trial by jury in civil causes is now abolished there, and by late alteration in the Jury Laws as regards criminal cases all the power of the jury-box is thrown into the hands of the few opulent mercantile houses, to the prejudice and danger of the whole body of educated natives, traders and others, no sentence of imprisonment under such Bankrupt and Insolvency Laws shall be at all carried into execution until the same has received the approval of the Governor-in Chief at Sierra Leone."", 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The expenditure of the settlement for each of the last eleven years is given in gross in Return 4 (Appendix) and in detail No. 6.

The revenue derived from customs in 1862 was 8,314l., raised by a duty on declared imports to the value of 99,825l.; in the following year, an export duty having been substituted for the import duty, the revenue raised was 10,125l.; but, had the import duty been continued, and those precautions taken to protect the Colony against fraud which it should be in the power of every Government to adopt, the duty, at the previous import rates, which would have been payable on imports to the value of 175,896l. would have been 14,634l., giving a clear gain of revenue of upwards of 4,500l. in that one year, which would have gone some considerable way towards paying off the liabilities of the Colony. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the present mode of raising the revenue has much to recommend it on the score of fairness, and that it has as yet been attended with some success.\n\nBritish law is administered in the Colony through the agency of a supreme court, which sits periodically at Bathurst, and is presided over by the chief justice; of a court of requests; and a police magistrate's court.

These and other matters have already been the subject of decrees. Lynch law is one of the first things the Government of a new State should put an end to; the King's first detailed code of laws, therefore, relates to the penal organization and the punishment of offences. This code regulates criminal procedure, and specifies punishment for offences occurring in the relations of Europeans and native races. The Court of Appeal is fixed at Boma, and Courts of first instance will be established at other places as necessity dictates. As regards the composition of the Court, it is made up of a magistrate appointed by the King, and a public prosecutor appointed by the resident Administrator-General. It was not advisable to provide for jury trial in the new State, but in cases involving the penalties of death or penal servitude, assessors will sit on the bench. A list of the leading residents, public servants, officers, and merchants, will be drawn up by the Administrator-General, and assessors will be drawn by lot from this list. In the Courts of first instance two will sit, and in the Court of Appeal four. There will be no difference between them and the magistrate while they are on the bench, the code not distinguishing between the verdict and the sentence, which will be rendered by the majority. If there is an equal division, the prisoner will be acquitted. Both prisoner and public prosecutor can appeal. The decree does not interfere with the native jurisdiction in offences between natives unless a European interest is involved. Thus only in three cases will the natives be amenable to European justice, viz.: 1. Where the offence causes a prejudice to a non-native or the State. 2. Where it is committed in a State establishment, or in the house or establishment of a non-native, or within a kilometre of such establishments. 3. Where it is connected with an offence imputed to a non-native. One of the first acts of the Financial Department has been to lay down the rules governing the acquisition of land in the new State. This is one of the most difficult problems which present themselves in the relations of civilized and non-civilized races. Colonel de Winton considered it so urgent that he issued an ordinance on the subject last July, declaring that no contract or convention with the natives for the occupation of any part of the soil would be recognized by the Government unless made with the intervention of a public officer appointed for the purpose. It also provided that all non-occupied territory belonged to the State, and forbade the dispossession of natives. In August the King signed a decree indicating the nature of the registration to be inaugurated. The mode of determining the rights of property claimed is based on the example of the Australian Acts. Three Government post-offices have been opened, at Banana, Boma, and Vivi; and in accordance with Article 7 of the Declaration of Berlin, the Congo State has already joined the Union Postale, its adhesion taking effect from the 1st January, 1886.

There were many reasons, and very serious ones, why this was imperatively called for. Because the Fort at Quitta got into grievous disrepair some ten years ago, the small detachment of West India troops until that time stationed there was withdrawn. The natives then fell gradually under the influence of Ashanti, with whom they formed alliance; and to whom they were of essential use in the supply of arms and munitions of war, as well as of many useful articles. We dare not say much about the slave sales of boys and girls which they also made there, seeing that similar atrocities were permitted at Cape Coast, where the British Government had its chief seat of authority. Having an immunity from the import duties which were levied at all the ports on the western side of the Volta by the British authorities, these trans-Volta districts enjoyed advantages in trade, which led to the settlement of not a few traders there. The accounts which reached us from time to time were of a very unsatisfactory nature; strongly elucidating that, however satisfactory these trading operations in native territory might be to men or firms who made themselves powerful, and could sufficiently bribe the native kings and chiefs, they were far from being so to the weaker traders, who, when wronged (and this was of but too frequent occurrence), were entirely at their mercy, and almost hopeless of obtaining redress. It was with the utmost satisfaction, therefore, that we learned of the extension of British authority, occupation, and rule to these districts, as recognized integral portions of the new Gold Coast Colony. It would have been unfair to the countries west of the Volta, that they should be subject to heavy import duties on certain articles, while their neighbours on the east side of that river, and trading with the same people in the interior, were free from such duties. We naturally expected that the imposition of duties at Jellah Coffee, Quitta, &c., would at first cause some dissatisfaction; but we believed this would be but transient, and that counterbalancing advantages derived from the presence of British authority, if that authority were judiciously exercised, would soon reconcile all the hitherto oppressed and wronged; whatever it might do with the oppressors and wrongdoers, who would naturally dislike the curb thus placed in their mouths, to restrain them in the indulgence of their unjust greediness. The first account we have received of proceedings in the Court of the British Civil Commandant, fully justifies the expectations we entertained. We do not know anything of the parties concerned, or of the merits of the dispute between them. All we can see is, that the one who had been placed in log by native authority, has had judgment in his favour by the British Commandant after a patient hearing; and that the decision was received with joy by the natives, who felt grateful to the Queen for having sent her authority among them. It is not difficult to understand this. The native courts everywhere are well understood to be subservient to those who can pay best, as against those who cannot afford to pay. The weak find little or no protection in them; and the change from this to the decision in a British court, in cases where there cannot, by any possibility, be a suspicion or charge of undue partiality on the part of the magistrate or judge, must commend itself to the public sentiment. We feel that there must be a great arrear of unredressed wrong, of postponed justice, in these trans-Volta seaports; and we expect to hear of many other cases not essentially differing from that of Bruce v. Williams. There are not any powerful English firms there, whose influence might be supposed, as sometimes at Cape Coast and Lagos, to warp and bias the mind of the presiding judicial authority; and we have, therefore, every reason to expect decisions in disputed cases, which will give general satisfaction; together with a feeling of security on the part of the weaker members of the community, which will be well worth the payment of regulated Customs' duties, and be, indeed, thus very cheaply purchased. All that will be wanting there, as in the older settlements, will be the occasional visits of a Circuit Judge, who would correct any error into which the local authority may have fallen. We rejoice over this extension of British authority among the sea-coast populations between the River Volta, and the territory of Dahomey, and look for a great tide of prosperity, and advance of civilization in those districts."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCUMULATION OF OFFICES IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We hope it will not have seemed invidious that we should in our last number have instanced Mr. Barry as illustrating the evils of the system of Government in our West African colonies and settlements.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died. For this offence he was tried at Accra in August 1889, but the charge of murder preferred against him having been withdrawn, he was convicted of assault only, and sentenced to...\n\nThe Acting Chief Justice to pay a fine of £5 and enter into his own recognisances to keep the peace for six months!\n\nThe curse of drink, misrule, flogging, murder, torture, and other atrocities has caused the black to ask, ""From whence come these white savages, who are more savage than ourselves?"" Slavery and slave-dealing has been renewed under our rule on the Gold Coast. ""Quite recently 5,000 girls and boys were brought from Salaga and other districts in the interior for sale at Accra and other English territory on the coast. This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government. This allegation is supported by the fact that on March 26, 1890, there appears on the record in the register of the Court at Accra an entry on the matter, and another entry in May of the same year.""\n\nAn intelligent rescued slave-girl gave me an account of how they were captured for sale in English territory. One tribe making a raid upon another seizes all girls and boys above a certain age, after which the old men, women, and young children are driven into a barn and burnt.\n\nGreat as is the curse of the slave-trade, the curse of drink is infinitely greater, for it destroys, not merely life, character, morals, and all that religion teaches, but even trade.

PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Western Law Courts, Plymouth, were recently well filled, under the presidency of Sir Henry Waring, by a large and representative audience to hear a paper on ""England and her West African Colonies"" read by Mr. Herbert Macaulay, of Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""In this document, fees and fines being imposed by the traditional rulers were reduced and regulations for their imposition were laid down; the Okwahuman Council was also to be made a truly representative body of chiefs and commoners and failure to attend was to be made punishable by fine.

Trade in foodstuffs was to be centralized in certain towns, a detailed list of market prices and trade fees was to be drawn up, the export of fish and game from Kwahu was prohibited and rules governing marriages, family responsibilities in debt cases, funerals, adultery by chiefs, etc., were laid down. As J. Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period.

All these measures which gave the traditional rulers powers to collect revenue and to impose court fines as were unknown before, were, according to Stone, 'an attempt to make the chiefs a living part of the machinery of (colonial) government'. Economically, the era saw the alternation of periods of boom with those of recession and inflation - the latter in 1915-17, 1929-30 and the second half of the 1930s. It also saw the spread of the cocoa industry into the rural areas especially of Akuapem and Akyem Abuakwa which led to the emergence of an increasing number of rich young farmers and long-distance traders. Socially, the period also saw the spread of elementary education into the rural areas and while some of the products of these schools drifted into the urban centres, others stayed behind and took to either farming or petty trading. With all these changes in their socio› economic status, these rural people began to demand a corresponding change in their political status and especially representation on the state and provincial councils, a demand which the ordinances mentioned above made steadily impossible. The principal objectives of the rural folk, then, were to acquire representation on these councils and, above all, to curb the increasing powers of their traditional rulers and the district commis› sioners and abolition or reduction of some of the fines and taxes being imposed by them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""Maclean's career3 blossomed after the new retreat of the British govern¬ ment, which, caught up between its embarrassing allies on the coast and the fighting spirit of Asante, felt that the Gold Coast was too expensive in terms of money and human lives despite the British victory at Dodowa.

He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

Never was there a more respectable educated jury empanelled on the Gold Coast. The case lasted five days, and at the end Mr. Chief-Magistrate Chalmers addressed the jury as if he were counsel for the prosecution. However, the jury were men of truth, and unanimously acquitted the prisoners. To describe the excitement that followed would be impossible. It came out in evidence that the first search-warrant issued by Mr. Chalmers had neither date nor seal, and the attorney for the prisoners made a good point of this great default; but Mr. Chalmers told the jury that it was perfectly in order; that as he had issued it from the Judicial Assessor's Court these mistakes or omissions did not signify, since he could do what he liked in that court; and that Governor McClean established a precedent to back up his ruling. Poor Fynn, his son, and Forson were kept in a beastly gaol for ten days. The so-called Colonel Foster-Foster, police magistrate, and prosecutor in this case, refused bail in 1,000l. for Fynn's and his fellow-prisoners' appearance; and at the trial they were honourably acquitted.

Foster could not find them. Salmon got in a rage, and ordered him to go again—hence all the trouble. Now what right had Mr. Salmon, as Administrator, to interfere in judicial matters? Surely Earl Granville has expressed himself plainly on the illegality of the executive interfering with judicial matters; but here, of course, all is exceptional.

The crime was one of infamous barbarity, and we felt the precise information was indispensable if the course of British justice was to be made clear to the natives of the West Coast. We therefore, with the kind co-operation of the Aborigines\' Protection Society, took the necessary measures for obtaining such information. It now lies before us; and with all due deference to the Governor-in-Chief and to the Earl of Carnarvon—no longer, we are sorry to say, Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies—we feel bound, in the interests of humanity, to express our strong disapproval of this exercise of the great prerogative of mercy. It may be deemed presumptuous on our part to call in question, and to condemn, this act of the Executive, since we are informed that the free pardon to William Shankling was granted on the recommendation of the Chief Justice, and that, after consideration of the documents laid before him, Her Majesty\'s Secretary of State saw no reason to question the propriety of the action of the Governor-in-Chief in this matter. The ground on which the free pardon was thus recommended and given was, we are told, ""that the proof of the death of the Krooboy \'Joe\' was incomplete."" Notwithstanding the weight of authority against us, the voice of our conscience and the great interests at stake forbid us to bow to this decision, which we regard as almost establishing an impunity for the crime of murder perpetrated by men in command of steamers on the River Niger. It is unquestionable that in the administration of justice in Great Britain, the law demands, as the first condition, an absolute proof of death before a man can be put on his trial for murder or manslaughter. The fact of death is generally established by a coroner\'s inquest on the body; and it is on proof thus obtained of the fact of death by violence, that the person charged with the commission of the crime is brought to trial. That this course is right where the circumstances under which the alleged crime was committed allow of the body being produced in evidence, there cannot be any reasonable doubt; but we never knew until now that where the circumstances attending the crime are such as to make it impossible to produce the corpse for identification and proof of death, any and every murderer may commit the heinous crime with impunity. If this be truly and indeed the state of the law—if this absolute and incontestable proof of death by production of the body be indispensable to conviction,—we see a total absence of protection not only for Africans and others on board steamers up the River Niger, but for all persons on board ships at sea. Look at this case of the poor wretched Krooboy (if Krooboy he were, though we had believed he was a native of Lagos). He is lashed up to the rigging of the vessel—flogged there mercilessly until half dead by the most inhuman violence; the danger of his falling overboard and being drowned is represented; the horrible torture is nevertheless ordered to be continued; the poor victim falls into the rapidly flowing river, as predicted; no effort is made to save him; the vessel is not stopped for his rescue, but ordered to steam on, full speed; he is lost sight of, and believed by everybody on board to have perished. That he did so perish, there seems to us not a shadow of reasonable doubt. That steamer was not the only one navigating the Niger. Others had gone up or down after this fearful occurrence, but nothing more had ever been heard of the poor African, although, as he had friends in Lagos, he would no doubt have made his way thither had he not really perished. The hypothesis on which the free pardon was granted is that he may have come to the surface and saved himself after the steamer had thus left him to his fate. We could perfectly understand that in this there might be found sufficient grounds for a respite and commutation of sentence had he been found guilty of murder and left for execution; but that on such grounds a man\n**38**'}, {'id': 4610, 'article_title': 'WEST AFRICAN NEWS', 'full_section_title': 'WEST AFRICAN NEWS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1883#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_05_1883', 'content': '## WEST AFRICAN NEWS.\n\n**CAPE COAST CASTLE, March 3.**—Four thousand Ashantees have renounced their allegiance to the King, and are desirous of establishing themselves at Denkera, under a British protectorate.

So much for the Judge. Then as regards the Administrator and his pliant and ready tools, the official and other J.P.'s of his creation. Finlason's case has proved that so far from the Administrator affording any protection against any abuse of power by the Judge, who thus asserts that he is superior to all law, he and the obsequious magisterial tools of his creation seem to fancy that if the Judge is superior to all law, they must necessarily be so too; and thus almost the whole official tribe (we are bound to say we have never heard one word yet against Mr. Simpson) become arrayed against the rights and liberties, the lives and properties of people who fancied they were living under the protection of the British Sovereign, and of British law.

We have shown that such is the reign of terror actually existing there, that it would be absurd to expect individuals should volunteer, or in any way give evidence inculpating official persons, while those persons retained the uncontrolled power to effect their ruin. And we now publicly urge the immediate institution of such inquiry by his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, who, as we are informed, is entrusted with ample power for the purpose. The accusations against officials at Cape Coast of inefficiency, general misconduct, waste of the public revenues, and an arbitrary and excessive abuse of power, so that no one who incurs official displeasure is safe, either as regards person or property, are so heavy and numerous that it is due to the officials themselves, as well as to the public on the Gold Coast, and to the honour of Her Majesty’s rule, that such a Court of Inquiry should be at once opened. If there had been any doubt previously as to the absolute necessity of this Court of Inquiry, it must, we think, have been removed by the following assertion said to have been made by Judge Parker in his Court at Cape Coast on the 6th July, when he concluded a long tirade against the “half-educated lawyers” pleading before him by saying, “I WAS TOLD AT THE COLONIAL-OFFICE THAT I MIGHT PUT ALL LAW ON ONE SIDE, AND DO AS I PLEASED IN MY COURT.” These words, we are assured, were taken down at the time by Mr. Bartels and Mr. Blankson, the pleaders, and other persons in the Court.

In the absence of a ""Secretary of State for the Department of Public Justice"" from the roll of British Ministers in Council, it devolves on the Colonial-office to be especially watchful and careful in this important matter. We believe that in a British colony or settlement, where there is no distinction of race, there will be found to prevail pretty generally such an administration of justice, because a community of British settlers will not bear to be trifled with in such things. But unhappily this is often far from being the case where the courts of justice are established principally for what is looked upon as an inferior race. We have seen too many examples of this. The sad outbreak in Jamaica was based upon the real or fancied oppression exercised by a district court, the decisions of which were taxed with partiality and consequently with injustice; and it is impossible for us to look with any satisfaction upon what is recorded in the above-mentioned letter as having taken place at Cape Coast. It must be borne in mind, too, that the circumstances at Cape Coast are exceptional, and exceptional in a particular which renders it tenfold more than ordinarily incumbent on the Colonial-office to provide against the possibility of any irregular proceedings or charge of injustice in the Cape Coast courts. Under the new decision of Downing-street, so far as we can gather these from facts and partial revelations, all that Cape Coast is to receive from Great Britain, in return for the customs and other duties, &c., exacted is an administration of justice—is the maintenance of open courts in which justice, in conformity with British law, shall be administered to colonists and natives. Yet, notwithstanding this, we had occasion to remark in past months on the seat of justice both in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court and in the Supreme Court being filled by officers of the West India Detachment quartered at Cape Coast Castle. Now this is in every respect indefensible. The Earl of Carnarvon (in his speech on the Jamaica question which appears in our columns), treating of courts-martial, says that ""these form at all times a very exceptional and very deplorable tribunal."" And why? Lord Carnarvon explains: ""No one will doubt this who considers the youth, the ignorance of the first principles of law, and very often the prejudices of their members."" We have eliminated what was irrelevant and inapplicable. And can any one doubt that these objections to the administration of justice by military officers are equally applicable when such officers are appointed to preside in the Supreme Court and the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court at Cape Coast, a locality in which, perhaps, because of peculiar climate, passions and prejudices seem to interfere, even under the most favourable circumstances, with the impartial administration of justice? Soon after this journal was established, four or five years since, we insisted on the necessity of some new arrangements at Cape Coast as regards official residence. We said then, and we say now, that the judges and magistrates ought not to be residents in the Castle with the Governor and military officers. A judge ought to be beyond the suspicion of partiality or bias, if his decisions are to be respected; and we are sorry to see that the Colonial-office have not made any change in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH POLICY AT THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Naturally affected as I am wherever the Gold Coast is concerned, allow me to make a few brief suggestions with reference to the resolutions passed by the House of Commons Committee on Western Africa.

The chiefs in the interior also are ordered to refer their disputes with each other to Cape Coast, and to answer there any charges brought against them by the Government. In ordinary cases they submit. It is cheaper for them to do so than to resist. But in consequence of the absence of territorial right beyond the narrow limits of the forts and settlements, judges and magistrates holding their authority from the British Crown are placed in the disgraceful and dishonouring position of being compelled to use their authority for the enforcement of native laws diametrically at variance with those of Great Britain. Under their mandate, runaway slaves are delivered up to their masters; and every wife and concubine, be it remembered, is a slave! We have lately seen in our columns under what circumstances of atrocity this had been done at Accra. British authorities do at the Gold Coast, under orders from England—which it would be impossible to justify—what, if done elsewhere without orders, would subject them to criminal prosecution and severe punishment. British authority is thus made the minister and upholder of slavery, polygamy, and other atrocities of heathenism and barbarism; too often even, it is to be feared, the involuntary abettor of murder and superstitious human sacrifice. Meanwhile, with a few honourable exceptions, the British employés, civil and military, as well as mercantile agents, have acted as if they were sent out to carry on a propaganda of drunkenness and debauchery. The climate, and the necessities which the climate is supposed to engender, have been urged and seemingly admitted, as an excuse for every kind of vicious excess. We have a host of concurrent testimony that the greater portion of the deaths which have occurred among Europeans in these settlements, and elsewhere on the West Coast, have been not from climate per se, but from climate acting upon persons improperly selected, brought from other enervating climates (such as the West Indies, &c.), with constitutions impaired, or upon systems vitiated and enfeebled by abominable impurity and dissipation. It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents. According to the custom of the country, these are marriages; but the Europeans contracting these alliances consider them as only a temporary convenience; and for the most part, when they leave the Coast to return to England, not only are the women abandoned, but the children born of them also, without any provision being made for them, and seemingly without remorse on the part of him who leaves them.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCUMULATION OF OFFICES IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We hope it will not have seemed invidious that we should in our last number have instanced Mr. Barry as illustrating the evils of the system of Government in our West African colonies and settlements. It is true that at the Sherboro the colonial surgeon has three other appointments also; that another official has two, both with handsome salaries attached, &c., &c. But it is at the Gold Coast that these evils have become most prominent, and have been most compromising, as regards the British official character and the purity of administration; and the loading with incompatible offices a gentleman who, however talented and estimable he may be, was quite new to official life, necessarily challenged remark from us, as the only public organ that represents Africa with the British public, and Great Britain with the Africans.\n\nThat the offices thus accumulated could not be properly held by one and the same individual at any one time, will very clearly appear when we state that the holder of one of them cannot, while charged with its duties, sit in the Council, while the holder of another of them becomes, in virtue of the office, a prominent and influential member of that Council. While charged, therefore, with the offices we have enumerated, Mr. Barry is at the same time expressly enjoined to attend the Council, and expressly prohibited from doing so. And this is not all. There is something which in our eyes is far more serious. In the administration of justice it is of the very highest importance that there should be not only an absence of all bias on the part of the judge, but also an absence of everything that could afford even the slightest ground for an imputation of partiality or predecision. The judge should not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. What, then, can be urged in favour or excuse of an arrangement by which an individual is, in his capacity of Queen’s advocate, the public and official prosecutor, and sits also as judge, in his capacity as acting chief justice, for the trial of the very causes he has, as Queen’s advocate, promoted and undertaken to substantiate? Surely this is a most flagrant impropriety; and we cannot be surprised that observers should challenge the purity and impartiality of justice thus administered or maladministered. But as if this was insufficient, that very time was chosen for promulgating new orders and regulations as regards pleading in the courts at Cape Coast were at the same time promulgated and enforced. Previously, any person might appear as advocate or counsel for a prisoner—any one might conduct or defend a suit in the court. But all this was changed.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice?

The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

We dare not say much about the slave sales of boys and girls which they also made there, seeing that similar atrocities were permitted at Cape Coast, where the British Government had its chief seat of authority. Having an immunity from the import duties which were levied at all the ports on the western side of the Volta by the British authorities, these trans-Volta districts enjoyed advantages in trade, which led to the settlement of not a few traders there. The accounts which reached us from time to time were of a very unsatisfactory nature; strongly elucidating that, however satisfactory these trading operations in native territory might be to men or firms who made themselves powerful, and could sufficiently bribe the native kings and chiefs, they were far from being so to the weaker traders, who, when wronged (and this was of but too frequent occurrence), were entirely at their mercy, and almost hopeless of obtaining redress. It was with the utmost satisfaction, therefore, that we learned of the extension of British authority, occupation, and rule to these districts, as recognized integral portions of the new Gold Coast Colony. It would have been unfair to the countries west of the Volta, that they should be subject to heavy import duties on certain articles, while their neighbours on the east side of that river, and trading with the same people in the interior, were free from such duties. We naturally expected that the imposition of duties at Jellah Coffee, Quitta, &c., would at first cause some dissatisfaction; but we believed this would be but transient, and that counterbalancing advantages derived from the presence of British authority, if that authority were judiciously exercised, would soon reconcile all the hitherto oppressed and wronged; whatever it might do with the oppressors and wrongdoers, who would naturally dislike the curb thus placed in their mouths, to restrain them in the indulgence of their unjust greediness. The first account we have received of proceedings in the Court of the British Civil Commandant, fully justifies the expectations we entertained. We do not know anything of the parties concerned, or of the merits of the dispute between them. All we can see is, that the one who had been placed in log by native authority, has had judgment in his favour by the British Commandant after a patient hearing; and that the decision was received with joy by the natives, who felt grateful to the Queen for having sent her authority among them. It is not difficult to understand this. The native courts everywhere are well understood to be subservient to those who can pay best, as against those who cannot afford to pay. The weak find little or no protection in them; and the change from this to the decision in a British court, in cases where there cannot, by any possibility, be a suspicion or charge of undue partiality on the part of the magistrate or judge, must commend itself to the public sentiment. We feel that there must be a great arrear of unredressed wrong, of postponed justice, in these trans-Volta seaports; and we expect to hear of many other cases not essentially differing from that of Bruce v. Williams. There are not any powerful English firms there, whose influence might be supposed, as sometimes at Cape Coast and Lagos, to warp and bias the mind of the presiding judicial authority; and we have, therefore, every reason to expect decisions in disputed cases, which will give general satisfaction; together with a feeling of security on the part of the weaker members of the community, which will be well worth the payment of regulated Customs' duties, and be, indeed, thus very cheaply purchased. All that will be wanting there, as in the older settlements, will be the occasional visits of a Circuit Judge, who would correct any error into which the local authority may have fallen. We rejoice over this extension of British authority among the sea-coast populations between the River Volta, and the territory of Dahomey, and look for a great tide of prosperity, and advance of civilization in those districts."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-09-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_09_1874#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}]",True

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': ""In South Africa the Afrikaner revolt of late 1914 against the government's decision to support the Allies was due both to pro-German sympathy and hatred of Britain. The Germans themselves did their best to provoke dis› affection among the African subjects of the Allies, being particularly active along the north-eastern border of Nigeria and in Libya. In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads. But colonial rulers were compelled to restore African independence and sovereignty, as will be seen in the next volume, not to the traditional ruling elite but to the new elite or members of the upper and lower middle classes, the creation of the colonial system, and this situation is never going to be reversed. If anything, the chances of African traditional regal institutions being abolished altogether, as for example they have been in Guinea, are much greater than their retention let alone their rehabilitation. Thirdly, it was colonialism that gave birth to African nationalism which was the product of the sense of anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and alienation generated by the colonial system. Fourthly, one colonial legacy which again has already played such a decisive role in the politics of post-colonial Africa is the army. This institution is not likely to be abolished and, as will be seen in the next volume, it has already changed the course of the history of many an African country, and it seems as if it has not completed its political innings yet. 'The man on horseback', to borrow Finer's phrase,$^{55}$ is going to be with us for a long time and will serve as a constant reminder, if ever we need one, of the colonial episode. Finally, it appears that the judicial and political institutions - the courts, parliaments, regional and district commissioners, etc. - are going to be retained even though some modifications and adaptations have been and will continue to be made.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

B. Sheridan, Member for Dudley, on the 22nd May, 1868, when Mr. Adderley stated—""That the charges in the petitions had been inquired into, and ascertained to be unfounded; and that the communication from Mr. Rainy had been inquired into and found not to contain facts."" The authority on which Mr. Adderley made this unqualified accusation against the petitioners and Mr. Rainy has not yet been fully exposed, but the day is fast approaching when the rottenness of that authority will be shown to the world, and when Mr. Adderley will be convinced how greatly he has been misled. We are persuaded that this question will never die out till the really shocking misdoings of Mr. Huggins, and his deception of the Colonial-office, are held up to public gaze in the same manner as the cruelties of Governor Eyre of Jamaica have been. He, too, for a long time hoodwinked the Colonial-office, and was covered by it as long as it was possible, but justice reached him at last, and Downing-street, finding him too heavy a load, threw him over. A similar fate is reserved for Mr. Huggins, however secure he may now deem himself. The matter was again brought before Parliament on the 27th of July, 1868, by the same honourable Member for Dudley, and again Mr. Adderley replied in the same manner as on the former occasion. In consequence of the discussions on the matter in the House, the Colonial-office condescended to reply to the petitions, and in a despatch dated 8th June, 1868, attempted to justify Mr. Huggins on the ground that the sentences he had passed were similar to those which had been passed by former judges of Sierra Leone. With all due deference to Colonial-office despatches, we must say that we conceive it impossible that the reason assigned in this one for exculpating Mr. Huggins can be regarded as a valid one. Because other judges passed illegal sentences and escaped impeachment, Mr. Huggins is justified in doing the same without being impeached! The petitioners, on receiving this extraordinary answer, addressed another petition to the Colonial office, in which they stated that Mr. Huggins had practised a very great deception on it, and showed that no judge of Sierra Leone had ever done what Mr. Huggins was charged with doing. In reply to this petition, in a despatch dated 26th February, 1869, the whole case was largely entered into, but Mr. Huggins had already been covered by the authorities, and it would not do to discard him now; he is still justified, but six of the sentences are condemned by Earl Granville as being unlawful. Meanwhile the petitioners were not idle, but addressed other petitions to the Colonial-office, in which they clearly set forth how completely Mr. Huggins had misled the Minister by wilful misrepresentations. One of the prisoners referred to in a petition, on whom Mr. Huggins had passed an unlawful sentence of whipping, for stealing a coat, a shirt, and a pair of trousers, without any previous conviction being set forth in the information exhibited against him or proved at his trial, brought an action against the tyrannical judge, who was put in the witness-box, and was, in fact, the principal witness examined in behalf of the plaintiff; and although every opportunity was given him at the trial to show by what law he passed this, as well as the other unlawful sentences complained of, yet he could not do so; an office copy of the evidence in the case was forwarded at once to the Colonial-office and to Mr. Sheridan by the plaintiff\'s counsel. Mr. Sheridan, being armed with this, and also with Earl Granville\'s despatch of the 26th February, 1869, in which six of the sentences were condemned as unlawful, brought the subject once more before the House of Commons in August last. The Colonial-office, on this occasion, found itself so sorely pressed that it was forced to promise that the entire matter should be referred to Governor Sir Arthur Kennedy, and pledged itself to lay the papers connected with the Huggins business on the table of the House of Commons after the termination of the inquiry. All this took place in August last. Here the matter rested; no official communication was made in reply to the petitioners, nor was an answer given to the communication of Thomas\'s counsel. But on the 11th April last, Mr. G. H. Moore came to the aid of the petitioners, and moved for the production of the papers which had been promised, when, to the surprise of every one (not that the papers were refused, for this was always expected by those who had watched the progress of affairs), the Under-Secretary urged that Sir Arthur Kennedy had held Mr. Huggins not blameworthy. There must be some mistake; no one here knows of any inquiries being made by Sir Arthur, nor is it here believed, either that Sir Arthur has undertaken to report that Mr. Huggins is not blameworthy, or that he even thinks that he is not blameworthy.'}, {'id': 3498, 'article_title': 'The Pardon and Liberation of William Shankling', 'full_section_title': 'The Pardon and Liberation of William Shankling', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1878#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_01_1878', 'content': ""\n\nThe judge no doubt thought, and we thought, that the two years of imprisonment was an effective sentence. We do not believe that he could have been prepared, as neither were we prepared, for what almost immediately followed. Shankling's case did not seem to us to be one in which the Executive could find grounds for the exercise of its power to mitigate or remit a sentence, that could not be qualified as vindictive. But the Executive thought differently. The Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony arrived in Lagos almost immediately after that sentence had been pronounced. He pardoned Shankling, had him released from prison, and sent forthwith, straight from the prison, on board one of the mail steamers then off the port, and bound for Liverpool. We, the *African Times*, are the concentrated voice of public opinion on the West Coast, and in the name of that public opinion, as also in that of outraged humanity, we demand to know what in the view of the Executive is the justifying reason for this seemingly most questionable exercise of the pardoning power. Here was one of two individuals responsible before God and man for a human life taken away by acts of hideous cruelty; responsible for about as cold-blooded a murder as the public press ever had to record; found guilty only of manslaughter, because he is a white man; sentenced to a comparatively very slight punishment, because he is a white man; and again, we presume, for we at present know of no other reason, nor can conceive of any other, pardoned and set free, with at least a most unseemly haste, because he is a white man. If this be the case, we shall begin to despair of any due administration of criminal justice in the British colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa. To us it seems that the distinction of being a white man bears with it a higher degree of responsibility than can attach to any African. Is it not an outrage to British Christian civilization, that a native of these islands should imitate on the West Coast of Africa, the worst deeds of blood committed in the blindness of heathen barbarism and superstition? There has been but too much of horrible cruelty practised on board some of the trading steamers on the River Niger—cruelty to which, if we are not grossly misinformed, Europeans, in their turn, have been victims, as well as Africans. An example was greatly needed to show to the vile perpetrators of such cruelties, that the arm of British law and justice is not altogether impotent, even as regards steamers on the Niger, and the poor unprotected Africans employed therein. One criminal is brought to justice, a jury convict him, though only of manslaughter, a British judge accepts and approves of the verdict, and passes a really lenient sentence for so great a crime, and, lo and behold, no sooner does the British chief of the Executive power arrive on the spot, than he hastens to repudiate the trial, the verdict, and the sentence by setting the prisoner free! We are entitled to know, we demand to know, we shall persist in demanding to know, why the Supreme Court of Lagos has been thus insulted by the Executive; on what grounds so criminal an act as Shankling was found guilty of, should he be left unpunished? If Shankling had been an African, would he have been thus pardoned? Had Shankling's victim been an Englishman, would Shankling have been thus pardoned? If we really mean to spread civilization in Africa, we must deal out equal justice to all, to both Europeans and Africans. There is no lesson that it is more important to inculcate in Africa, than that of the sacredness of human life, whether under a black skin or a white. This lesson must be at the root of all Christian civilization. The sacredness of human life is one of the essential differences between paganism and Christianity; and natives of a Christian country, subjects of a Christian Power, members of a Christian community, ought to teach it wherever they go. We fear it has been forgotten in this case of Shankling by the Executive of the Gold Coast Colony, that this lesson is needed. But we wait further information; we wait for the Executive to justify itself in this matter. If the Secretary of State for the Home Department had made such a remission of sentence, he would be called upon, and authoritatively called upon, to justify his such use of the Royal prerogative of mercy. What a Secretary of State may be called upon, and would be called upon, to do, a governor of West African settlements may certainly be equally called upon to do. We call, therefore, anew on the Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, to justify the use he has made of the Royal prerogative, in this pardon and release of William Shankling.""}, {'id': 6849, 'article_title': 'TRIAL OF DR.

It was proved that the women had escaped from Kilima-Njaro to the fortified village of the chief Malamia, who had met the demand for their surrender by repeated evasions, in consequence of which Dr. Peters bombarded and burnt the village. The women had been recovered and had been brutally whipped, so that blood flowed copiously and the captives were finally unable to scream, but lay piteously moaning beneath the lash. One of them, a girl named Jagodjo, having been placed in chains, effected her escape, but was surrendered by the chief to whom she fled, when she was at once condemned to death by the same Court (Peters, Pechmann, and Jancke) which had sentenced Mabruk. The sentence was carried out by the same executioner and in the same manner as in the previous instance. In connexion with this case grave charges were made against Peters by the Socialist Bebel, who asserted in the Diet that, in a letter of Peters to the English Bishop Tucker of Uganda, he stated that the reason of the execution was that the girl had subjected herself to the penalty of death by being unfaithful to her master. The evidence given in the Court disproved the existence of any such letter. Bishop Tucker, on the other hand, had written to the German Consul in Zanzibar to inform him that Lieut. von Bülow, Peters's successor at Kilima-Njaro, had stated it as his own belief that the hanging of Mabruk had been inflicted as punishment for his relations with the women of the station. Several English and other missionaries had expressed the opinion that the execution of the girl could not be excused by the danger of an attack upon the station and by her treachery.\n\nDr. Peters's own examination conflicted in many points with the other evidence. His explanation of these discrepancies was that the other witnesses must have an imperfect memory of the occurrences.

Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""from time to time to call attention to abuses and oppression, most serious in their nature and degree, as affecting the fortunes, liberties, and even the lives of Her Majesty's subjects. But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE TORTURE SYSTEM IN CAPE COAST PRISON.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have no doubt there have been and are some honourable men connected with the Cape Coast administration who have deplored what was going on, but who, not being legally responsible, overlooked their moral responsibility, because they could not admit it without interfering with heads of departments or denouncing those with whom they were compelled to live and associate.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN ADMINISTRATOR IN PERIL — GENERAL EXPOSURE OF ABUSES IN GOVERNMENT, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## COPIES OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS—ELUCIDATION OF CAPE COAST LAW AND JUSTICE.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_05_1869#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As a general rule, law is by no means a cheap commodity.

It also notes the British government's resumption of direct control over coastal settlements in 1843, governed by a legal convention among chiefs recognizing British law, which could lead to inconsistencies and misapplications in local contexts. However, the textbook does not delve into specific instances of these complexities or misapplications. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed examples supporting the claim, such as the introduction of a bill by Mr. Huggins, the Queen's Advocate, which required plaintiffs in damage actions to provide security for costs. This proposal, reflecting an attempt to adapt English legal practices, was criticized for potentially denying justice to those without property, highlighting the misalignment with local realities. The articles also discuss Mr. Huggins's controversial legal interpretations, such as his handling of indictments for subsequent offences, which deviated from English norms and led to increased punishments without proper legal basis. This selective adaptation resulted in legal misapplications, as evidenced by petitions against Mr. Huggins and calls for a court of appeal. Additionally, the withdrawal of trial by jury and the absence of a local court of appeal further complicated the legal landscape, contributing to a sense of injustice.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day. The Sierra Leone Selection Trust (SLST) was given exclusive rights to prospect for, mine and dispose of all diamonds for 99 years beginning in 1933."" It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Between 1816 and 1823 the impetus came from the Governor, Sir Charles MacCarthy, an administrator and builder with the soul of a missionary. The continual growth of the population, and its eagerness to put down roots, made improvement of the amenities impera› tive. As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade. The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

(h)\n\nThis is a question which the Executive is bound to examine for itself, and to act on the judgment which it may form.\n\nOn this accordingly Mr. Huggins has furnished a report: He is no doubt right in stating that the Act of 7 and 8 Geo. IV., c. 28, sec. 11, is in force in Sierra Leone, and that many of the sentences complained of are justified by that Act; (i) but some of these sentences—viz., those marked J, M, P, Q, S, and T in the petition transmitted in your despatch of August 11, 1868—appear to me not to be so justified, as in all these cases the prisoners were charged and convicted of larceny only as the subsequent offence, and, therefore, did not come within the Act. I also entertain doubts as to the legality of the sentence in the case marked C in that petition.\n\nIt will be your duty to request Mr. Huggins to explain this apparent excess of jurisdiction, and after receiving that explanation, to consider, in conjunction with your legal advisers, and ultimately, of course, with the assistance of your Executive Council, whether the sentences were or were not warranted by law.\n\nAny punishment which in your opinion is not so warranted, and not yet undergone, you will of course wholly remit. And if any person, still in confinement, has, in your opinion, already suffered a punishment not warranted by the nature of his offence you will remit to him the rest of the punishment.\n\nThus much for the question of law.\n\nThere remains a charge against Mr. Huggins's veracity.\n\nIn contradiction to his statement as to the usage of the court, certain forms of information are cited in which a previous conviction is regularly set forth according to the English precedent.\n\nThis is not inconsistent with the substantial correctness of Mr. Huggins's statement, in which, I may observe, he was corroborated by the Sheriff, Mr. Mehenx. (k)\n\nWhat is necessary for him to show, is not that the English form was never adopted, but that the judges have not been in the habit of insisting upon its adoption. Mr. Huggins will probably be glad to have the opportunity of supporting his statement by reference to the records (l) of the courts of the colony.""}, {'id': 1574, 'article_title': 'FIFTH PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE RE MR.

And the 116th section of that Act provides the form of indictment for a subsequent offence after a previous conviction for felony or misdemeanour, in which form of indictment the previous conviction is specially alleged. It is stated that Mr. Huggins sentenced prisoners to the increased punishment\n\ndue to a subsequent conviction on being satisfied of the previous convictions, although the convictions were not stated in the informations according to the form provided by the Act of Parliament. Mr. Huggins explains that it is for the judge to decide what parts of an Act thus adopted in a colony are really in force in them; he adduces what certainly appear to be very good reasons for thinking that this section of the Imperial Act is not applicable to the circumstances of Sierra Leone, and he has therefore treated it as not in force.""\n\nIt had to be noticed, my lord, in the former petitions against Mr. Huggins, that the despatches dated 8th June and 22nd September, 1868, afforded conclusive evidence that allegations had been made to his Grace the Duke of Buckingham respecting these matters, which had had the effect of misleading and deceiving his grace with regard to them; and it has now to be noticed that the despatch dated 26th February, 1869, affords conclusive evidence that allegations have been made to, or have come before, your lordship which have had the effect of similarly misleading and deceiving your lordship.'}, {'id': 1574, 'article_title': 'FIFTH PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE RE MR.

What is really the case, your petitioners are informed, my lord, is that it is not in consequence of any section or provision of any Act of Parliament an indictment or information is necessary stating fully and exactly what the offence is which is prosecuted for, but that it is a fundamental part of the common law that there shall always be such an indictment or information in every prosecution; and that, with regard to prosecutions for such offences as that of committing a felony after a previous conviction, it is besides settled law that in such prosecutions the indictment or information must state the previous conviction; and also that if it does not state it no heavier punishment can be imposed than that which the law prescribes for the offence which the indictment or information does state.'}, {'id': 1574, 'article_title': 'FIFTH PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE RE MR.

One of these passages occurs at page 55 of Archbold\'s Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, by the late Sir John Jervis, the late Mr. Welby, and Mr. Bruce, and is as follows: ""Where a statute annexes a higher degree of punishment to a common-law felony, if committed under particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence, in order to bring the defendant within that higher degree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have been committed under those circumstances, and must state the circumstances with certainty and precision.—2 Hale, 170."" Another of the passages alluded to occurs at page 79 of Vol. 1 of the last edition of Russell on Crimes and Misdemeanours, by Mr. Greaves, and is as follows: ""And where a statute makes a second offence felony, or subject to a heavier punishment than the first, it is always implied that such second offence ought to be committed after a conviction for the first, from whence it follows that if it be not so laid in the indictment, it shall be punished but as the first offence.""\n\nYour petitioners are moreover advised, my lord, that section 116 of the Act 24 and 25 Vic., c. 96, is of itself sufficient to render it evident how utterly wrongly Mr. Huggins has acted, and how greatly deficient of a proper knowledge of law he must be to act in such a manner. For what this section really does, your petitioners are advised, my lord, is, that it contemplates an indictment stating the previous conviction, and stating it at length, to be necessary at common law, and to prevent the statement at length from continuing to be necessary, it proves that it shall be sufficient in the indictment to state the previous conviction in a brief and compendious manner, ""without otherwise describing the previous felony misdemeanour,"" &c. So that if Mr. Huggins held this section 116 not to be suitable to the circumstances of Sierra Leone, and not in force in it, the legal effect of his so holding was, my lord, not, as he seems to have utterly wrongly supposed, to enable the increased punishment prescribed for a felony after a previous conviction to be inflicted without the previous conviction being stated in the indictment, but to render it necessary that the previous conviction, instead of being stated in the indictment in the short manner allowed by this section, should be stated at length as necessary at common law.'}, {'id': 1574, 'article_title': 'FIFTH PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE RE MR.

It would appear, my lord, by the intimation given to the Executive Government, that it should treat Mr. Huggins\'s judgments (except of course those in the seven cases specially particularized) ""as authoritative, unless and until a contrary decision should be pronounced by some superior court,"" that your lordship is under the impression that there is some superior court by which a contrary decision could be pronounced; but that, my lord, as has been explained, is not the case: the only authority by which a contrary decision could be pronounced, being the Secretary of State for the Colonies, acting in conjunction with the Law Officers of the Crown, or after a reference to such officers.\n\nYour petitioners beg leave to mention also, that some mistake seems to have occurred with regard to the cases specially excepted. It appears to have been intended that cases excepted should be those in which prisoners sentenced to whipping were convicted of larceny only, or larceny as a subsequent offence; but two cases of this nature are not included in the list of exceptions. One of these cases is that of the Queen v. Thomas Williams, who, as will be seen by the office copy of the information against him, annexed to the fourth of the petitions against Mr. Huggins and marked E, was charged and convicted of no more than simple larceny as a subsequent offence; the other is that of the Queen v.

What this man was charged with was, however, not charged as a subsequent offence, but as the sole offence. Your petitioners beg therefore to respectfully solicit attention to these cases.\n\nThe next part of the despatch dated February 26, 1869; to which your petitioners beg to refer is the following: ""I should perhaps add, with a view to future legislation, that the law as laid down by Mr. Huggins appears to be more suitable to the circumstances of Sierra Leone than the law prescribed by the English Act of Parliament.""'}, {'id': 1574, 'article_title': 'FIFTH PETITION FROM SIERRA LEONE RE MR.

But now that your petitioners have been made aware that there is such a rule, it will, of course, be their duty to conform to it.\n\nYour petitioners beg now, my lord, to advert to the practice which has been mentioned as having been existing for a very long time in both the English and the Sierra Leone Courts, with regard to criminal cases in general, and which, it is conceived, must be what Mr. Meheux, the sheriff, had in view in what he seems to have stated on the subject. It has to be observed, in the first place, with regard to this practice, that the punishments prescribed for offences leave, in most cases, much to the discretion of the judge, and consequently require discrimination to be exercised by him in imposing them. As, for instance, supposing the punishment prescribed by a legislative provision to be ""not exceeding two years\' imprisonment, with or without hard labour, and with or without solitary confinement,"" a judge who, without discrimination, should, in every case that came under this provision, impose the utmost punishment that might be imposed under it, would obviously but poorly acquit himself. Discrimination has therefore to be exercised; and your petitioners are advised, my lord, that it is considered that this discrimination should be exercised in such a manner that a novice in delinquency should not be sentenced to a punishment suitable to only an old offender, and, on the other hand, that an old offender should not be sentenced to a punishment suitable to only a novice in delinquency. And that it is considered that discrimination should be exercised by judges in this manner, your petitioners are advised, my lord, appears in well-known and well-reputed works. Thus, there is a passage in Mr. Dickinson\'s work on Sessions, published in 1815, in which this appears, and this passage has been copied into most of the editions of Burn\'s Justice which have been published since that time. It may have been, and probably has been, copied into all the editions of Burn\'s Justice since the publication of Mr. Dickinson\'s work, but there are not the means at Sierra Leone, my lord, as far as can be ascertained on your petitioners\' behalf, of examining any earlier editions of Burn\'s Justice than the twenty-sixth, which was published in 1831.'}]","[{'document_title': 'LAWYERS AND LAW COURTS AT SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following appeared in an evening paper, and gives faithfully what was in the *Times*.

If all the natives of that colony were to join our enemies, the Ashantis, in disgust at English injustice, it ought not to cause us the smallest surprise. Our courts of law in Freetown—if the facts be as described—are merely stages whereon justice is made into a cruel farce. The lawyers of the colony, it seems, have so far forgotten what is due to their honourable profession as universally to accept retaining fees of 10l. annually from the leading firms and wealthier residents in the place, engaging themselves not to appear against them in any action. The consequence, of course, is that when a native desires to sue one of these firms or individuals, he finds not a single counsel free to undertake his case. And further, the negro, if he attempts to fight his own cause in the court, is immediately met by a demurrer to set aside his motion as irregularly brought forward, and he is left wholly without redress. We find it very hard to believe that the boasted English love of justice and fair-play has ended in such a *fiasco* as this, and that the judges and lawyers, and the whole English society of Sierra Leone have not been ashamed to permit it for an hour.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-09-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_09_1873#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""from time to time to call attention to abuses and oppression, most serious in their nature and degree, as affecting the fortunes, liberties, and even the lives of Her Majesty's subjects. But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

Mr. Horatio James Huggins has been appointed to the judicial seat vacated by Mr. Carr, and Mr. Algernon Montagu has been appointed second judge of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone. Now, my Lord Duke, Mr. Huggins has never been called to the bar, or received a legal education; he merely practised as a third-class attorney at St. Vincent and Trinidad, and although in the infant state of a colony necessity might sanction such an appointment, I hardly think that it could be justified in such a settlement as Sierra Leone. In Mr. Huggins' case, great natural abilities do not atone for the want of a legal education; his official blunders have entailed vast expense upon the colony, and all the seizures which he has advised as Queen's Advocate have been annulled by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with damages and costs. I venture to say, my Lord Duke, that the confirmation of Mr. Huggins' appointment would create universal dismay in the colony, because, as trial by jury has recently been withdrawn at Sierra Leone, in all civil actions property would no longer be deemed secure under his judicial guidance."", 'last_edit_date': '1867-04-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters. The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

The author in the first chapter deals with the historical aspect of the case, showing that trial by jury dates from times almost prehistoric, and that there is no other system which is so uniformly satisfactory; quoting Dr. Lolme: ""The main object of the institution of trial by jury, being to guard accused persons against all decisions whatsoever from men vested with any permanent official authority, it is not only settled principle that the opinion which the Judge delivers has no weight but such as the jury choose to give it, but that their verdict must besides comprehend the whole matter in trial and decide as well upon the fact, as upon the point of law that may arise out of it—in other words, they must pronounce both on the commission of a certain fact, and on the reason which makes that fact contrary to Law.""

There are, it seems, two other appeals to the Privy Council against decrees pronounced by the same judge (!!) at Sierra Leone, in which the same Mr. Shaw, Acting Collector of Customs, is the defendant. We should not be surprised if a sixth or an eighth part of the entire revenue of the colony for the current year were to be thus swallowed up. The taxpayers of the colony have no control over the public expenditure. They have only one representative in the Legislative Council; and the power to dispose at will of their money is in the hands of the Governor and of officials who see with the Governor\'s eyes and vote with the Governor\'s tongue.

At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like. The revenue of the protectorate is derived from licenses and a house tax. The staff in each district consists of a District Commissioner, surgeon, and company of frontier police. Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security. The effect of the further establishment of British administration and tribunals has been the movement of a number of Natives from the coast into the interior with the purpose of trading, and there is therefore every hope of an increasing development of the natural products of the protectorate in the near future.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Assistant Judge at Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A Southern proverb says ""beware of the kick of a dying ass."" Such a kick has reached Sierra Leone, and through it all the West Coast. The information we gave last month was not correct. Mr. Phillippo is not raised to the bench at Sierra Leone, but has been Gazetted as Queen\'s Advocate there, with Mr. Horatio James Huggins as ASSISTANT JUDGE. A more wanton and abominable outrage on a people by a government is rare. But beyond a mere expression of indignation at that perversity in evil against the African people which has survived official connexion with them, we shall endeavour to refrain from all further allusion to the pernicious influence which has prevailed at the Colonial Office in this instance. Our business is with the appointment, not with the influence under which it was made. There has been a most shameful abuse of the powers of government to the injury and danger of a whole people, and the degradation of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the keystone of the arch of civilization. It is a monstrous insult to common sense for a government to talk of ""preparing a people for self government,"" while acting on a system of which the appointment of Mr. Horatio James Huggins to be Assistant Judge of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone is only an additional evidence. We contend anew, and will never cease to contend, that a government, to be worthy of the name, must be something more than the mere distributor of the spoils of a people among official sycophants; and equally that both the feelings and the interests of a people demand consideration on the part of their rulers. Let us examine a little this case of Mr. Huggins, and at the outset we request our readers to peruse (p. 113) the list of official appointments simultaneously held by him, and the annual income he has thence derived at the expense of the revenues of the colony. Having done this, we beg of them now to observe that this Mr. Huggins is not a member of the English, Scotch, or Irish bar, but simply an attorney practising in the West India Island of St. Vincent, ""remarkable,"" as a distinguished English barrister observed to us a day or two ago, ""for nothing but his ignorance."" Transplanted to Sierra Leone, where the people have really no voice in their own government or in the disposal of the revenue raised among and from them, he was truly a laughing-stock whenever he appeared in court as Queen\'s Advocate; and has since given abundant evidence that he is totally unfit to hold any judicial post. Attention was called last year in the House of Commons to a list of illegal sentences pronounced by him as Acting Judge at Sierra Leone. But what of all this. The seemingly most worthless things have their uses in the Divine economy of nature, and why should not incapable and worthless lawyers have also theirs in the human economy of governments? At all events Mr. Huggins had his, or his name would not appear as the holder of that long and lucrative list of appointments. Ex-Governor Blackall found him the man he wanted in his grand attack upon the constitutional rights of the African people; and having such official plunder at his disposal we ought not to feel surprised that this man became his subservient tool. But is it not a deep disgrace to the Home Government that they should not only allow such men successfully to conspire against the liberties of a people to whom they have been a veritable curse, but should also persist, at the ex-Governor\'s suggestion, in still further rewarding this man, at the expense, and to the danger and injury, of his very people. Surely 1,600l. a-year, in addition to a son\'s pickings of 300l. a-year in the same colonial pastures, ought to have been deemed an adequate reward even for such services, especially as the insulted and injured ones are forced to be the paymasters. But no; the injured Sierra Leone people have dared, however humbly, to represent to their rulers here and in the colony that they are entitled to some consideration—that if they must necessarily be regarded as official milch cows, they ought, at least, to be allowed to have milkers not disagreeable, offensive, and dangerous to them; and this colonial impertinence has received the castigation which the presiding Jupiter and his anti-African subordinates could not fail to deem that it deserved. The fiat has gone forth; Her Majesty\'s beloved name has necessarily been associated with the insult and the injury. Mr. Huggins shall be Judge of the Supreme Court—the Court of Appeal of Sierra Leone—and ""Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to appoint Horatio James Huggins to be"" &c., &c. As he has the advantage of being already in the colony he will, we suppose, have been formally inducted before this paper reaches Sierra Leone. We confess to a profound disappointment as well as to a bitter indignation. His Honour Chief Justice French was entitled to more consideration, even if none were due to the people of Sierra Leone. Mr. French, a barrister of Lincoln\'s-inn, seems to be a worthy and competent judge, and ought to have 2,000l. a-year, instead of 1,500l. which he now receives; 2,000l. of honest and open salary, and not soiled in any portion of it by injurious and shameful sinecures. Our readers must bear in mind that the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone is now the Court of Appeal from the decision of the Chief Magistrates at the Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. It is on this ground that two judges have now been assigned to it, instead of only one as heretofore. Was it not natural for us and for the people of Sierra Leone to hope that Mr. Huggins\' entire unfitness being so indisputable, some worthy member of the English Bar would have been sent out as Assistant-Judge to assist Chief Justice French? Our hopes went even further, and pointed to a third efficient judge, in the person of yet another member of the English Bar, because we cannot understand a Court of Appeal, especially in Sierra Leone,\n119', 'last_edit_date': '1868-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1868#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I met in St. Louis an English-born Freetown negress who told me that, having a dispute about property in Freetown, she had gone to law there.

The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity.

I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous.

This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

The General History of Africa highlights the role of missionaries and the colonial government in shaping Sierra Leone's judicial and administrative structures, emphasizing the influence of Western values and the integration of various ethnic groups through education and language. This suggests a level of public interest, as colonial authorities were conscious of their humanitarian mission. However, the text does not delve into the stability and continuity of judicial practices or their subservience to colonial powers, focusing instead on the broader impact of colonialism, including the introduction of new judicial systems and the role of local chiefs. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific instances of public engagement, such as petitions to the Colonial Office demanding the restoration of trial by jury, reflecting public scrutiny and dissatisfaction with justice administration. The articles also reveal systemic issues, including the influence of the Executive over the judiciary, as seen in the trial and execution of Whobay, and the alleged intimidation of juries by Crown Prosecutors. The removal of trial by jury in civil cases and the absence of a local court of appeal further illustrate these systemic issues. Additionally, the continuity of judicial practices is evident in the appointment of officials unaccountable to the local population, aligning with the claim of stability through subservience. Together, these sources provide a nuanced understanding of the colonial legal system in Sierra Leone, highlighting both public scrutiny and the systemic issues that ensured its continuity under colonial rule.","The General History of Africa textbook provides some insights that can be associated with the claim regarding the colonial legal system in Sierra Leone.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

As the seat of the colonial government and the naval Vice-Admiralty, the victualling base for the naval patrol, and the official liberation centre for the Mixed Commissions, Freetown and the interior could count on a more or less regular injection of subsidies. MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade. The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'African music', 'content': ""But music did not minister only to the mysterious and the profound.

If there be one thing that more than any other demands the constant watchfulness of a public press dealing with the affairs of a Crown settlement, it is that of the relations existing between the executive and the judicial bench. A recent occurrence in Ceylon placed the vital importance to the public of an independent judiciary in a very strong light. A British colonist had made himself disagreeable to the Executive by an opposition to its acts and plans. It was determined to get rid of him; and unscrupulous means were employed. Obsequious medical officers were found ready to give a certificate of his insanity; he was seized for deportation to England; and it was only because there happened to be an independent judge on the bench there that the deeply-injured man obtained his release, and is enabled to proceed against the tyrant Executive for reparation. No private individual is safe where the executive can exercise a controlling influence over the administration of justice. Did the Executive exercise such an influence at Sierra Leone in the case of Whobay, becomes, therefore, a question in which every one is interested at Sierra Leone and in all the British settlements on the West Coast. The abominable outrage on Mr. Finlason at Cape Coast two years ago, which would have ended in murder had we not intervened, was only possible through a guilty complicity between the Executive and the judge. We cannot, therefore, look with too much jealousy upon any judicial omission or act that wears even the slightest aspect of subservience toward the Executive, or a yielding to its desires in the so-called administration of justice. And we fear we see this on the part of the judicial bench in the trial of Whobay. We hope we may be wrong, but it does seem to us as if there had been a feeling in the highest judicial quarter that it was not worth while to make itself obnoxious to the Executive by such a watchful care for strict legality as might have disappointed it of its prey, when that prey was only a poor ignorant, friendless, alien African. How else can we account for it that the Chief Justice overlooked, persistently overlooked, the all-important question, raised several times by the counsel for the prisoner during the trial, as to whether the prisoner could be legally tried in that court for the crime with which he was charged? Either the Chief Justice had no doubt in his own mind as to the legality, and if so, he ought to have distinctly stated it and the grounds of his decision, or he had doubts, and having such ought not to have allowed the trial to proceed. Instead of doing either one or the other of these, he submitted the other question of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner to the jury, without pointing out to them that such a doubt had been raised, or stating, as he ought to have done, that, having been raised, it must necessarily be decided before any action could be taken by the Executive, should their verdict be unfavourable to the prisoner. We should not have been surprised at such a course of proceeding by Mr. Justice Huggins, whose subserviency to Governor Blackall cost the West Coast its now confiscated right of trial by jury in civil causes, and forms one of the ineradicable charges against him as unfitting him for any judicial office in the colony. But that Mr. Chief Justice French should thus have exposed himself to the suspicion of being unjustly deferential to the Executive when the life of a fellow-creature (however vile and worthless according to civilised ideas) was at stake, pains and grieves us as much as does the conduct of the Executive itself in the matter. As watchman for the public at large on the West Coast we feel, however, more than pain and grief; a just indignation and an anxious solicitude override and stifle these. We look upon that Executive triumph over the life of a poor alien savage as a foul and loathsome blot on the Executive; and at the co-operation of the bench, whether through carelessness or deference, as deepening and intensifying that blot; because the corruption in any way, however brought about, of the judiciary by the Executive strikes at the very root of all security for life and property, converting the Executive into an unbridled monster, dangerous to every individual in the community who may refuse to yield it an unreasoning obedience. It is our duty, as a public guardian, under such circumstances, to cry aloud and spare not; to know nothing of individuals; to see only pernicious principles striving to obtain the mastery; and to expose and combat these principles by every legitimate means at our command. It is our duty to suppose an odious, tyrannical governor at Government House (a species not unknown in the history of Crown colonies), with, at the same time, a Jefferys on the bench; and to estimate what the colony would become under the working of such principles with such a governor and such a judge. We ask our readers to make such estimate, and they will not fail to see at once how all-important it is that proceedings such as have taken place in this trial and execution of Whobay, should be exposed and denounced. If (and we see no reason to doubt it, as it is stated to have been a matter of public notoriety) Mr. Montagu, as Crown Prosecutor, acted and spoke, using the name of the Governor, as he is reported to have acted and spoken, we cannot do other than look upon that Governor as deeply compromised in not having officially and publicly disowned and rebuked him in his calculated effort at intimidation of juries in criminal Crown prosecution. There can be no doubt such acts and words were intended to have a prospective influence. He was charging the prisoner, who had been acquitted by the jury he stigmatised and covertly threatened in the name of the chief of the Executive, with another crime, upon indictment for which he was once more to be put on trial; and he must have been endeavouring by such stigmas and implied threats to enforce upon the minds of that future jury the necessity of declaring that prisoner guilty, since the Executive so desired. We feel sure that if there had been a court of criminal appeal in England whose decision could have been applied for in this matter, and if it could have been substantiated before such court that such preparatory efforts had been made to prejudice and control the verdict of the jury which returned the verdict of guilty, that court would have quashed the conviction on that ground alone. It is monstrous that such efforts at intimidation of juries in criminal cases should be permitted. If they are to be permitted, and if juries in criminal Crown prosecutions are only to be registrars of the wishes and desires of the Executive, we quite agree with the Editor of the _West African Liberator_ that it is better this last supposed safeguard of individual liberty should be confiscated by Her Majesty's Government, as trial by jury in civil causes has already been, and that the whole responsibility in such criminal trials should be left to the Executive and the judicial bench, and then, God help the poor people of Sierra Leone! Mr. Montagu was with Mr. Justice Huggins one of the subservient instruments of Governor Blackall, with which he acted upon Her Majesty's then Secretary of State for the Colonies, for obtaining that confiscation of the right of trial by jury in civil causes which will always be remembered by the people of the West Coast Settlements against the Colonial-office and its deceivers. We do not, therefore, feel any surprise at the conduct imputed to Mr. Montagu, who, after the unrebutted charges long since brought against him, ought to have been removed from any position of trust or responsibility. We trust that the public will not rest satisfied until the whole of this matter has been thoroughly investigated, and the guilty parties brought to justice.""}, {'id': 1995, 'article_title': 'Proceedings Taken by Judge Horatio James Huggins against Wm.

A few remarks may be necessary in explanation. In criminal cases the question submitted to the jury upon the evidence is a very simple one—viz., ""Whether the prisoner be guilty or not guilty;"" and in well-conducted prosecutions the whole of the evidence bears upon that point. Further, qualified jurors are usually persons of some property, and they have an interest in the repression of crime, and in giving security to life and property by their verdicts. In civil suits the case is somewhat different. These suits are usually actions arising out of commercial transactions and complicated accounts. The issues raised by the pleadings are oftentimes many and various. The litigating parties, if not on friendly terms with the jurors, are generally well known to them. And the opposing attorneys, contending for success and for their costs, not infrequently bewilder and distract them by the mass of matter they adduce in evidence in the hope of influencing them in their verdict. Add to all this the advocacy of these attorneys, without any public opinion to check them in their course, and the jealousies existing between the different races and tribes inhabiting these settlements, and it is not to be wondered at that verdicts in civil suits on this coast should have given less satisfaction than verdicts in criminal cases.

At the end of the year, however, the total assets of the colony exceeded the liabilities by £19,355; but Sierra Leone contributes nothing to the cost of maintaining the local troops, which last year amounted to £64,421. The total value of the imports last year was £494,688, of which four-fifths came from the United Kingdom. Geneva and rum are the most important articles in the import trade; last year they showed a large decrease, but the increase in other articles, especially cotton goods and hardware, were so great that on the whole year there was an increase of 16 per cent. in imports. The exports amounted to £449,038, a slight decrease on the previous year. This was in the export of African produce, due in great measure to the action of some Native chiefs in the protectorate who were discontented with the new arrangements for levying duties on spirits, and prohibited their people from gathering and selling the produce. Half the total export trade is with the United Kingdom. It has been ascertained during the year that there are large tracts of country in the protectorate in which the valuable rubber-tree, *Kicksia Africana,* abounds. The construction of the railway between Freetown and Songo Town has been commenced, and good progress has been made. A protectorate was proclaimed in August over certain territories adjacent to the colony within the British sphere of influence. The area is about 30,000 square miles, and the population is estimated at from a quarter to half a million. The protectorate is divided for police purposes into five districts; three different kinds of Courts were established—those of the Native chiefs, those in which the chiefs and the District Commissioner sit together, and those of the District Commissioner alone. All civil cases and the lesser criminal ones go to the Native chiefs; the mixed Court tries all graver criminal matters, while the District Commissioner alone tries all cases in which persons who are not Natives are concerned. All capital cases go to the Supreme Court of the Colony, as well as certain specified offences, such as witchcraft, slave-raiding and slave dealing, faction or tribal fights, and the like. The revenue of the protectorate is derived from licenses and a house tax. The staff in each district consists of a District Commissioner, surgeon, and company of frontier police. Prior to the creation of the protectorate, order was maintained by the frontier police, which within the last few years has quelled all inter-tribal warfare and slave-raiding, and reduced the country to peace and security. The effect of the further establishment of British administration and tribunals has been the movement of a number of Natives from the coast into the interior with the purpose of trading, and there is therefore every hope of an increasing development of the natural products of the protectorate in the near future.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-11-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice at the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The jurisdiction of the Chief Justice for Sierra Leone being lately extended to the West African Colonies, of which Gambia forms a portion, common justice to the people there should move the Colonial Office to instruct his Honour to visit that colony on circuit at least four times a year.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads. But colonial rulers were compelled to restore African independence and sovereignty, as will be seen in the next volume, not to the traditional ruling elite but to the new elite or members of the upper and lower middle classes, the creation of the colonial system, and this situation is never going to be reversed. If anything, the chances of African traditional regal institutions being abolished altogether, as for example they have been in Guinea, are much greater than their retention let alone their rehabilitation. Thirdly, it was colonialism that gave birth to African nationalism which was the product of the sense of anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and alienation generated by the colonial system. Fourthly, one colonial legacy which again has already played such a decisive role in the politics of post-colonial Africa is the army. This institution is not likely to be abolished and, as will be seen in the next volume, it has already changed the course of the history of many an African country, and it seems as if it has not completed its political innings yet.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates.

Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.602, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'Sierra Leone and Liberia', 'content': ""The factors that made for the success of Liberia were of three kinds.

The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed.

To tempt first, and afterwards to punish, is said to be the practice of the Arch-enemy of mankind. And here we have first, a demoralising and debasing system pursued year after year by the Sierra Leone Executive, under approval, of course; and then in due time comes forth the edict declaring the citizens to be incapable of discharging properly the duties of jurors. We utterly deny that they are so. To state it thus is to add insult to injury. But if it were so, who is to blame but the Executive, which mentally starves a whole people? We know of no greater cruelty or injustice than thus to impeach men with moral defects and delinquencies which could clearly be traced, if they did really exist, to the evil direction of the accuser. Surely if the object of all criminal law, and the machinery which it employs, be not merely to punish but to deter, Governor Blackall would find in the powerful instrumentality of education a more efficacious and Christian mode of attaining this desired end than that of the costly and immoral action of an exaggerated police force. The prophetic power of Pitt, the philanthropy of Wilberforce, the untiring energy and exertions of a Buxton and a Brougham, have expended themselves upon the social and moral advancement of Africa; and could some of them look from out their honoured graves, they would wonder that after eighty long years the lamp of knowledge should be so scantily supplied in their favoured regions, and brute force alone be in the ascendant. We grant that the latter, the rule of brute force, is the best a Government can adopt if it has determined that a people shall be kept in a low and debased state, or if, having once raised them to the dignity of citizens, it purposes to rob them by piecemeal of all that gives dignity to citizen life, and favours social advancement. Under the drowsy influence of universal ignorance, you may treat men as slaves, and in the fulness of time rob them of the sacred shield of the jury-box; but a wise and honest, above all a Christian Executive would shrink with horror from attempting to debase where it might elevate, or to take away where it is within its power justly to bestow. It is awful to think what must have been the state and condition at this time of Sierra Leone, if the noble Church and the Wesleyan Missionary Societies had not stepped in to the rescue of the people from ignorance and debasement. By and through their noble exertions there is an adequate number of citizens fit in every way for the duties and responsibilities of the jury-box, notwithstanding the disgraceful Government laches in the matter of education. But, as we have before urged, the time has come when this ought to cease. There are ample revenues now at Sierra Leone to enable the Executive to supply education to the people. Since the citizens have no power over the disposal of those revenues, they have but one course to pursue. Let them petition the Colonial-office, petition the British Parliament if necessary, either that some effective voice in the disposal of their money be given to them, or that the police should be reduced, education promoted, the jury-box preserved, the sanitary condition of the colony improved—in a word, that the proceeds of their duties and taxes should be spent for their social and commercial advancement as becomes a free people, and not in the exorbitant employment of brutalising influences, on worthless favourites, and unproductive follies.

The petitioners appear to be principally marksmen who could hardly have understood the language used in the petition. The objection seems to be against the 11th section of the Ordinance, which provides that actions at law shall be tried by one or more of the judges of the Supreme Court, without a jury. This provision has not been made without due consideration.\n\nBy referring to the Report of the Select Committee appointed in 1865, to consider the state of the British settlements on the Coast, it will be seen that Colonel Ord, the Government Commissioner, and other witnesses examined before the Committee, stated it to be their opinion that some alteration was necessary to improve the administration of justice under the present jury system. They thought it worked fairly, on the whole, in criminal cases, but not in civil causes. In the Draft Report prepared by the Chairman of the Committee, it will also be seen that the opinion is expressed that trial by jury was inapplicable in many cases.\n\nMy own experience on the Coast leads to the same conclusion. In civil cases it is a system unsuited to the present condition of these settlements. It is uncertain in its results, and attended with heavy and unnecessary expense. Further, the number of qualified jurors is very limited, and most of them but very imperfectly understand the English language. They are also usually known to the litigating parties, and they are liable to be swayed by the views of the local attorneys who practise in the Courts both as attorneys and advocates. Another disturbing cause to the fair administration of justice under this system is to be found in the numerous tribes and races inhabiting these settlements, their clanship, and the jealousies existing between them. For these and other reasons it is believed many persons prefer to compromise their claims, or to desist from prosecuting them, rather than submit their cases to the decisions of juries on the Coast.\n\nIn conclusion, I would beg leave to refer to the 12th section of the Ordinance, providing that, on the trial of all civil causes in the Supreme Court, the evidence given at the trial shall be taken down in writing by the officer of the Court. With this provision for taking down the evidence, and with an appeal to Her Majesty in Council, I apprehend there is ample security that justice will be fairly administered by the judges of the Court, and greater satisfaction given than by the present jury system.

As all the writings of the late Chief Justice went to help his success in being pensioned, I need not wonder at anything which he says; but he could not have been doing justice to the Government and the people of Sierra Leone for the last twenty-five years, when, as the Supreme Judge of the Court, he could have reported that ""the ends of justice would never be attained,"" as ""the number of qualified jurors is very limited, and most of them but very imperfectly understand the English language,"" &c. This alone goes to show what sort of a judge Mr. Carr was, and would be if he were still in office. Of such as him it is written, ""Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?"" No; the laws of Providence are fixed. It is well said, and I regret to repeat it, ""that a white man can make a black man a stepping-ladder to get at another black man beyond his reach as easy as possible.""

If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**""}, {'id': 1494, 'article_title': 'A Judicial Staff at Sierra Leone for the Whole West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'A Judicial Staff at Sierra Leone for the Whole West Coast', 'last_edit_date': '12-23-1868', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_12_1868', 'content': 'expenses of the judges on circuit would of course be paid by the settlements served; and we are convinced that every matter of detail could be easily arranged.

We are so fully convinced—every mail bringing record of fresh facts to strengthen our conviction—of the imperative necessity for such a judicial staff to be so selected, so paid, and so employed as we have proposed, that we rejoice at all evidence of the question making way. A Bill, necessarily arising out of the Ordinance for establishing a legal Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone, came in February under the consideration of the Colonial Legislature. Thanks to Sir A. Kennedy the discussions in that Council are now public, and we are glad to see the African Interpreter giving them that prominence in its columns by which they may come within the cognisance of all the inhabitants of the Colony. The Bill we now allude to was laid before the Council by order of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and has for object the abolition of the former Court of Appeal in the colony, which consisted of the Governor and Council. As the Queen\'s Advocate observed, ""There is now (nominally at least) a Court of Appeal for the whole of the West African settlements."" He said: ""Suppose a case were tried before the Supreme Court when sitting at nisi prius, there was an appeal to it in banco."" But although there was an effort to make it appear that such an appeal, to a court of only two judges, was in some degree satisfactory, there was an evident conviction in every mind that it is an absurdity. Mr. Ezzidio evidently felt it very strongly, and did not hesitate to give expression to the public dissatisfaction with one of the two existing judges, Mr. Huggins, although he did it in a very delicate way. The Governor-in-Chief, as governors-in-chief no doubt ought, strove to make the best of the absurd blunder of the Secretary of State in having constituted so defective a Court of Appeal as that emanating from the Supreme Court as now organised undoubtedly is—but his honest good sense got the better at last of his official reticence, and he could not help saying, ""I do not think it improbable that at no distant date you may be able to appeal from one judge to three judges. I shall not be astonished if that be found necessary."" This is so far encouraging. We are indeed sure that so sensible a man as Sir A. Kennedy would not be astonished at such a change. The matter of astonishment seems to us to be that men of such undoubted ability, as we have at the Colonial-office in England, should have ever thought of constituting an Appeal Court where appeals from Dick or Harry lie to Dick and Harry, without any third judge to give a casting vote should Dick and Harry disagree, and to give real authority to the decision, and make it satisfactory to appellants and the public, should they agree. We beg pardon of the judges of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone for the familiar way in which we have stated the existing absurdity under familiar names. We mean no disrespect. Though we disapprove in every way of Mr. Huggins as one of the judges, still while he is judge of this court, even while calling for his removal, which we do, and shall never cease to do, Her Majesty\'s commission in him, however misplaced we may deem the trust to be, must be treated with respect; while, as regards Mr. Chief Justice French, we scarcely need say to readers of the African Times, that we respect both him and his office. We have thought it right to take notice of this important discussion in the Legislative Council. We hope it foreshadows an efficient and satisfactory Court of Appeal for the whole West Coast; and we cannot doubt that if such a court is constituted as we have proposed, the other portion of our proposal will still be adopted—viz., that the two puisne judges should go on circuit regularly to the other settlements. Sierra Leone alone could not be saddled justly with the expense of three judges, paid as able and really learned judges ought to be paid, merely to constitute within it a satisfactory Court of Appeal for the whole West Coast, and the other settlements could only justly be called upon to support the puisne judges as we have suggested because of their dispensing justice regularly in such settlements. Mr. Parker has now been removed from Cape Coast, and will not, we hope, have a successor; which he need not have if a judge from the Supreme Court at Sierra Leone makes periodical visits there to dispense justice according to British law.'}, {'id': 1561, 'article_title': 'WEST INDIA REGIMENTAL OFFICERS AS MAGISTRATES, &c.', 'full_section_title': 'WEST INDIA REGIMENTAL OFFICERS AS MAGISTRATES, &c.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_05_1869#article-17', 'issue_date': '22_05_1869', 'content': '* There are, of course, exceptions; but good men will not be ready, unscrupulous tools, and are not therefore favourites of the Blackalls, Ushers, Simpsons, &c., &c.\n\nbetter than refer to the letter of our Special Correspondent there (p. 134), on ""What Justice and Policy Demand.""

(a) If there is no such court, he is without remedy, except that in the case of a criminal, the Queen and the Governor may, to a certain extent, arrest the course of justice by remitting his punishment. Any petition for a remission of sentence should be addressed to the Governor, and may, if he should refuse to accede to it, and not till then, be brought, through him, before the Secretary of State.\n\nThe Executive Government, however, though subject to the above exception, it has not power of righting a complainant, yet, has the power of dismissing the judge; and would properly exercise that power if a sufficient case of incompetency, ignorance, or carelessness were established against him.

We have not seen a copy of these proposed regulations under which, as we are informed, Government officials are to enjoy the right to six months' leave in every two years, on full pay, and with free passage to and from England. But we presume that as these leave regulations are framed solely on the ground of such absence from the Coast being necessary to the preservation of health, and as such necessity cannot exist as regards Africans, the said right of leave, with its valuable accessories of full pay and passage money, is only to be enjoyed by Europeans, and not by native African officials. To give such privilege to the latter would indeed be to introduce a system of leave for Government employees which does not exist in England, nor, so far as we are aware, in any other country in the world; and it does not seem at all likely that such extraordinary liberality in the public service, as the allowance of three months' leave out of every twelve, would first be bestowed on Africans. We therefore take it as granted that only European officials employed on the West Coast are to be the happy recipients of this liberality. Some points of great interest to the people of the African settlements, therefore, immediately present themselves for consideration. We choose to presume—what ought to be, but what, unfortunately, is not the case—that every European taken into Government employ on the West Coast, whether originally by appointment of the Colonial-office, or by appointment in Africa confirmed by the Colonial-office, is so appointed because, or with the full certainty of, his being fit in every respect for the office he is appointed to. Well, this supposed efficient official is to have, periodically, six months' leave; what guarantee is there to be that the person who becomes his _locum tenens_ for those six months shall be equally efficient, so that the public service shall not suffer, and what remuneration is this substitute to receive? The remuneration of course, whatever it may be, must be paid by the colony in addition to the salary of the absent official, and the expenses of his voyage. Here is a direct double interest which the settlements have in this question—_i.e._, the African people in them—viz., as regards _fitness_ for the duties, and as regards _expense_. But this is not all. We will take a case in point for illustration. There are many of the offices of trust the incumbents of which give security. Mr. Kneller, for instance, Collector of Customs and Treasurer at the Gambia, has given what the Government has deemed adequate security as regards the money under his control. Mr. Kneller, as is at present the case (only that in the present case he is interdicted by a hostile Administrator), is absent on his leave, and a Mr. Fowler—a man recently introduced into the Government service on the West Coast—not by appointment of the Colonial-office, but only by confirmation of that office—this Mr. Fowler, _who has given no security_, becomes Mr. Kneller's _locum tenens_; not by any delegation from Mr. Kneller in virtue of which Mr. Fowler's acts would be the acts of Mr. Kneller, and Mr. Kneller would be answerable for Mr. Fowler's defalcations should he prove a defaulter, but by appointment of his patron and friend the Administrator, who does not take any pecuniary responsibility to the colony in making such appointment. And this is a very serious question. Even in this instance of the Gambia, it appears by the financial statement, which we publish in another column, that Mr. Fowler, the non-security giving _locum tenens_ of Mr. Kneller, has several thousand pounds, and valuable securities of the colony, entirely at his own disposal and in his power; while, in the case of a colony such as Sierra Leone, the amount, at any given time, would be very much greater, the revenue of Sierra Leone being nearly four times that of the Gambia. In the present pressing need of the West Coast Settlements for every penny of their revenue for those improvements without which their progress must be disastrously cramped and slow, the loss of some thousands of pounds by any of them, through the defalcations of a non-guaranteed _locum tenens_ of a guaranteed collector or treasurer, would be a very serious thing; and we do say unhesitatingly that it is the duty of the Colonial-office to impose as a condition of the leave of any such responsible officer, that the person who temporarily performs his duties should be equally guaranteed, either by the Administrator who appoints him, or by some other person or persons. But there are other considerations than pecuniary ones involved, and considerations, too, of the very highest importance. Take another case in point—viz., that of the Chief Magistracy of the Gambia. We published last month, and briefly commented upon, a most objectionable Ordinance, enacted by the Gambia Official Legislative Council at a most objectionable time—and we said unhesitatingly that, after full consideration of all the attendant circumstances, it did appear to us as if the intention was to give the fearful powers conferred by that Ordinance to Mr. Fowler (already referred to) or to some other irresponsible creature of the Administrator. Are the lives and properties of the people of Lagos, Cape Coast, Accra, and the Gambia to be from time to time, for six months at a time, during the absence of the Colonial-office-appointed Chief Magistrate, at the absolute mercy of some creature of the Administrator—which, as shown lately in the case of Mr. Lovell, at Cape Coast, is equivalent to the making an absolute tyrant of the Administrator, who may himself at the time be only _acting_—only the _locum tenens_ of a Colonial-office-appointed Administrator. Then, again, look at Sierra Leone, with no court of appeal, save as from the chief or assistant-judge of the Supreme Court, to the same judge or judges as appeal. Imagine Sierra Leone for six months under the sole judicial management of Mr. Huggins; and imagine Mr. Montague or Mr. Walcott acting at the same time as Queen's Advocate by delegation of the absent holder of that office, or by appointment of some other Governor-in-Chief than Sir Arthur E. Kennedy; or imagine, through the action of the same system, the said Mr. Montague or Mr. Walcott, at the same time, one as Queen's Advocate and the other as Chief Police Magistrate, by virtue of such delegation or appointment, Mr. Huggins being also the only judge! Are not these indeed points of very serious interest? And are we not entitled to demand, on behalf of the African people, that they shall be very seriously considered by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and his permanent Colonial-office advisers? We do demand this on their behalf; and here we must stop for the present, as we find the question far too large to be disposed of in this article in the brief limits within which it is necessarily restrained.""}, {'id': 1713, 'article_title': 'Judicial Proceedings Without a Jury', 'full_section_title': 'Judicial Proceedings Without a Jury', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-16', 'issue_date': '24_01_1870', 'content': ""The case Rainy v. Bravo brings into such glaring light the evil working of that disastrous change wrought in the civil jurisprudence of the West Coast of Africa through the successful machinations of Ex-Governor Blackall, Carr, Huggins, and Bravo, which robbed Sierra Leone of the right of trial by jury, enjoyed by its people for sixty-five years, that we have felt compelled to postpone the insertion of matter already in type, and give prominence to a condensed report of the proceedings in that case, and the address of Mr. Rainy, the plaintiff, in support of his declaration and motion for a new trial. Far removed from the bitter personal quarrels of the locality, and not recognising the existence of any of them, except in so far as they have relation to the struggle for popular rights and privileges against that unholy official conspiracy organised against them in Governor Blackall's time, we are in a position to form a calm and dispassionate judgment as to what has been and is taking place in the courts of law under the regime of judicial decisions without a jury. And that judgment is totally adverse to the exercise of such powers by a judge as those with which Sierra Leone judges are now entrusted. Of one of these, Mr. Huggins, we have nothing to say in this matter, because we hold that after his flagrant judgments in those criminal cases which were brought under the notice of the House of Commons last year, he ought not to be a judge in Sierra Leone, whether assisted by a jury or not so assisted. But of the other, Mr. Chief Justice French, we have much to say. In our last issue we felt it our duty again to call attention to his continued residence in the military barracks by sufferance of the military chiefs, and his being also by sufferance a member of the military mess. This would have appeared to us shamefully objectionable even under a full jury system, there being no necessity of any kind for it; but with a judge whose sole decision is virtually irrevocable, because the only accessible appeal in almost every imaginable case is from him to himself, he having been in the first instance uncontrolled by a jury, such continued residence and messing in barracks by military sufferance calls for the deepest reprobation. In our last we had to remark upon the case of Finlay v. White (a member of the military mess), now we have to call attention to that of Rainy v. Bravo, who, when the cause of action arose, was in command of the troops, head of the military mess, and autocrat in barracks. Major Bravo, as police magistrate (for this lucky illiterate soldier was not only in command of the troops in garrison, but police magistrate at 600/. per annum), wrote from barracks and had published in his court a most improper, libellous, and injurious letter as regards Mr. Rainy. About this there cannot be any dispute. The effect was to transfer all Mr. Rainy's practice in that court to a Mr. Walcott, in whose favour Major Bravo wrote in the said letter. Mr. Rainy instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court before Mr. Chief Justice French, Major Bravo's mess.""}, {'id': 1826, 'article_title': 'Judges without Juries—Rainy v.

We were not, however, unmindful of the official difficulties in the way of such a measure of justice. It is not pleasant to admit that Secretaries of State can be deceived and err; and we can understand that such a man as Earl Granville would naturally shrink from the implied censure on a predecessor in his high office which such an admission would involve. While therefore our unalterable conviction and sense of duty, as the public guardian of African rights and interests, make it imperative for us to insist on the right of the people of Sierra Leone to a revocation of the infamous ordinance which Governor Blackall smuggled through his obsequious and guilty Legislature, irrespective of evils arising out of the change thereby effected in the administration of the law, it becomes important to show that evil has arisen—that it is rampant—and that the only possible remedy for it is the restitution to the people of trial by jury in civil causes. The able and temperate letter from ""An Occasional Correspondent,"" p. 122, enables us to do this, and furnishes just that kind of proof which is calculated to bridge over the difficult chasm, between official delicacy to a predecessor in office and justice to an injured people. We always proceed upon the assumption (which we are sure is a correct one) that the Colonial-office and its chief for the time being desire to do what is right as regards the West African Settlements; and we therefore feel convinced, that if the noble Secretary of State for the Colonies, or Mr. Monsell, can find time to examine into the working of the ""judge without jury"" system as therein briefly, but graphically, portrayed, neither the one nor the other would again state that they ""see no sufficient reason for reversing the decision as to trial by jury which was conveyed to the predecessor of Sir Arthur Kennedy in 1867."" No sufficient reason, when, as our occasional correspondent justly remarks, ""nothing can be more satisfactory than Chief Justice French\'s decisions in litigations where only men of colour are concerned, but the moment a military officer or a high civil officer is touched, his entire feelings go along with him, however strong a case may be made against the offender!"" No sufficient reason, when, as he further remarks, with regard to this case of Rainy v. Bravo, ""That so simple a case should have occupied the judge so long is something monstrous. A jury would have been expected to give a verdict within a few minutes after hearing the matter; but a judge, whose comprehension is said to be superior to that of native jurors, and to enable him to grapple with matters of fact in an instant, takes the unnecessary period of three months to give a judgment, which, after all, seems to be contrary to both justice and equity, and is as inconsistent as can well be conceived! If Mr. French be right in Bravo\'s case, then he must certainly be wrong in that of Metzger; take it how you may, he is in gross error somewhere, and every sensible and unprejudiced person believes he is unpardonably at fault in the former. Then, too, the expenses incurred under this new system of trial are something enormous, whereas, under the old, a very trifling sum would have defrayed the entire cost of such an action. The suspense also in which suitors are kept during the delays of the judges in deciding such simple cases is another very great inconvenience, and subversive of the ends of justice""! Well may he say that if Mr. Metzger were justly punishable for reading Major Bravo\'s letter in the court, Major Bravo could not be guilless in writing and sending that letter to his subordinate, Mr. Metzger, and ordering him to read it in court. We have only thus briefly quoted our correspondent\'s letter in order to direct attention more especially to it. If there were ""no sufficient reasons"" for a reversal of the Colonial-office decision of 1867 as to trial by jury at Sierra Leone before the trial of the cases Rainy v. Bravo and Rainy v. Metzger, and the scandalous delay of judgment in the cases of Lewis v. Huggins and Shepherd v. Goldsworthy, still in suspense, there is surely ample and sufficient reason now for so doing; and feeling confident, as we have before said, that there never can be a desire on the part of a Secretary or Under-Secretary of State to perpetuate an injustice in any of Her Majesty\'s colonies or settlements abroad, we do look forward with hope to a very different reply from the Colonial-office to such renewed petitions for the restoration of trial by jury as the people of Sierra Leone may now send forward.'}, {'id': 1898, 'article_title': 'Another Petition for a Better Administration of the Law in Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'Another Petition for a Better Administration of the Law in Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1870#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_09_1870', 'content': ""The following, which is the Tenth Petition which has been addressed to the Colonial-office by the inhabitants of Sierra Leone relative to the bad administration of the law, was in the course of being signed when the last mail left._\n\n**PETITION TO THE COLONIAL-OFFICE, GIVING ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY JURY TRIAL SHOULD BE RESTORED, AND PRAYING THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SELECT AND RETURN THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.**\n\nTo the Right Hon.

It is necessary further to call your lordship's attention to the fact that the community is a trading one, many of whose inhabitants carry on business in the surrounding rivers. These men are occasionally the suitors in our courts, and during the time their cases are pending, having to remain in the settlement awaiting the convenience of the judges, they suffer serious inconvenience and great loss in their business, which they are compelled to desert.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**""}, {'id': 2555, 'article_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'full_section_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'issue_date': '29_08_1873', 'content': ""to reserve any point should he think fit for decision by the Judges in Banco at Sierra Leone on his return from Circuit; and a right of appeal from the decision of this Judge to the Court at Sierra Leone being preserved. The burden of an Administration of Justice thus organized would not be at all oppressive for the Settlements with their actual and prospective revenues; while, if proper precautions be taken, it would be beyond suspicion, and give such a feeling of security that the expense, if kept within reasonable limits, would never be objected to. We urge this anew on the attention of Her Majesty's Government. The need is urgent. We have heard of cases in which the Local Magistrate would himself have been brought to the bar of the Judge of Assize—cases that have done great injury, because of the existing absolute denial of justice in them, for want of the visits of a Supreme Court Judge on Circuit. We hold the opinion—we may say conviction—that a system such as we have thus outlined, would be greatly superior and greatly more satisfactory in its results than the re-establishment of Supreme Courts with local resident Supreme Court Judges in all the Settlements as heretofore; because the Judge on Circuit would be free from all local bias, which a resident Judge in such very small civilized communities never could be, or, at least, never would be believed to be. For the information of such of our readers as may not be aware of the facilities of communication now existing between Sierra Leone and the other Settlements we may state that there are now five mail steamers per month, outward and homeward, from and to England, so that the other Settlements are now quite as readily accessible from Sierra Leone, as assize towns distant from London were to our Assize Judges a few years ago. Our limits will not allow us to do more at present than to implore an unbiassed consideration of the proposed changes at the Colonial-office.""}, {'id': 3150, 'article_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1876#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_07_1876', 'content': 'the public peace and individual security.

The subject of public retrenchment at Sierra Leone is not new to our pen; we have often insisted upon it since the failure of changes introduced after the Parliamentary Committee of 1874-5 had become apparent. A profligate public expenditure tends to a profligate private expenditure, and thus to dishonesty, immorality, and other fearful evils. Now there has been a very profligate expenditure since the period above alluded to. With so large a number of mail steamers passing up and down the Coast, a steam yacht for the Governor is quite unnecessary. When all the West Coast was placed under Sierra Leone, and Sierra Leone was to be a Court of Appeal for the whole Coast, additions were made to the judicial establishment and to legal salaries which are now absurdly disproportioned to any legitimate wants of the administration of justice among so small a population. We deprecate the squandering of money that has taken place on a useless river wharf, so badly constructed that the steamers will not use it, and which has led to the creation of public debt. But as this is now irremediable, we let it pass without further comment. Do away with the Governor\'s yacht, if it still exists; reduce the judicial staff, and the salary of Queen\'s Advocate—an office which there are now native advocates fully competent to hold, and which, therefore, does not need to be exorbitantly paid because of climatic considerations. Let there, moreover, be an unsparing removal from office of every public servant, whether British or African, who can be dispensed with, leaving the public service uninjured. The creation of a host of petty, unnecessary Government employments has been a great evil, engendering a paltry Government dependence essentially demoralizing in its nature, as being destructive of all self-respect and self-reliance, and the feeder of a social vanity which has only served to make its victims ridiculous. Sierra Leone must enter on a new course, unless it is to become an opprobrium instead of a praise on the West Coast; and we sincerely trust that Lord Carnarvon will impel it resolutely on that course. Meanwhile, we shall be glad to receive from Sierra Leone friends suggestions for the economic purification of the public service, so that the evils which an unjustifiably profuse expenditure has engendered may be removed, public scandals be put an end to, and education and religious teaching be guaranteed that support which we deem to be indispensable to the healthy progress of a community such as that of Sierra Leone.'}, {'id': 3216, 'article_title': 'The Native Pastorate and the Local Government of Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'The Native Pastorate and the Local Government of Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-10', 'issue_date': '02_10_1876', 'content': 'The non-payment of the last quarter of the last year\'s grant to the Native Pastorate at Sierra Leone in due course, and the sudden and previously altogether unnotified withdrawal of the grant for the present year, are matters not only affecting in a most painful manner the interests of that useful and devoted body of men, the Native Pastors, but also affecting to a very serious degree the best and, indeed, vital interests of the whole population of the Colony. We alluded briefly to this important subject in our last month\'s issue; briefly, first because the other matter we had pressing for insertion would not easily allow of a more extended notice; and, again, because we indulged the hope that, with the return of the Governor-in-Chief to Sierra Leone, wiser counsels would have prevailed; and that we should ere this have received the gratifying intelligence that the sacred charge upon the revenue for the Native Pastorate had been restored to its proper place in the estimates for 1876-7, the unpaid amount for the last quarter of 1875-6 being also discharged. We deeply regret that no such intelligence has reached us, from which we are justified in inferring that the Local Government persist in this most ill-advised and, as we think, discreditable policy. The petition by 1,079 persons to Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, which will be found in another column, sets forth the case of the petitioners very clearly. The fourth paragraph exhibits very strongly the arbitrary and discourteous manner in which the Government resolution was communicated to the managers of the Native Pastorate Fund: ""You are no longer in our estimates;"" ""not the slightest previous intimation of the discontinuance altogether of the grant having been given,"" &c. We do not think that we lie open to just censure when we qualify this as a ""brutal"" withdrawal of the grants. We cannot view it in any other light. Not one expression of regret that the unfortunate condition of the Public Treasury made it indispensable for the Executive to retrench in so important a matter as the religious instruction of the people, who, without religious instruction, had almost better have been left in their original native barbarism; not one word of pity for the distress so sudden a change of policy must occasion; not one word of hope as regards the future! We cannot wonder that the petitioners, who are not the Pastors themselves, but the members of their churches, from whom the petition spontaneously emanated, should say that they were ""stunned"" by the Government communication. It must be borne in mind that the sphere in which the Native Pastorate almost exclusively labours is in the villages of the Colony, and not the city of Freetown (with the exception of Christ Church, Freetown, which had, during the last year, joined the Native Pastorate, at the special wish and desire of the late venerable and lamented Henry Venn). Wilberforce, Hastings, Kissy, York, Kent, Waterloo, Bathurst, Wellington, Regent, Gloucester-cum-Leicester, and Bananas—names which appear in the summary of receipts that we append to the petition—are all villages. The people in these villages have only one harvest, that of ginger. On this they depend for their entire support. The bad ginger market during the present season must have told most disastrously on many a village home; and we are not at all surprised, therefore, to learn that unless they shall be able to find some other mode of obtaining a livelihood which, in the absence of enterprising capital, is not to be expected—it will be difficult for them to continue to do as much as they have hitherto done, much less to increase their contributions so as to supply in any appreciable degree the wants caused by the withdrawal of the Government grant. Considering the limited means of these poor people, we think they deserve great praise and great consideration on the part of the Government for what they have hitherto done towards the support of their pastors, by which they have shown in a very strong manner their sense of the value of religious ministration among them. We cannot doubt that the Earl of Carnarvon will see this important matter in the same light as that in which we see it. His lordship, we are certain, estimates too highly the value of religious instruction among a people who, it is no reproach to them to say, have only within a very few years emerged from the blackest depths of ignorance and superstition, to regard with indifference the false direction in public economy taken by the Local Government of Sierra Leone in this matter of the Native Pastorate, as also in that of the schools; and we therefore look to him with entire confidence to undo the evil which the Local Government has ignorantly committed. There seems to be some doubt as to whether the question of the grant for 1876-7 was discussed at all in the Legislative Council. If this was so discussed, and if the grant was thus cancelled, this discussion and the subsequent vote was with closed doors. Some portion of the proceedings in the March Council was, it seems, so conducted, contrary to the practice generally followed during the last few years. A reporter who was present at the sitting was politely requested to withdraw until he should receive an intimation to re-enter, which intimation not reaching him after he had waited some three-quarters of an hour, he went away. Dark deeds shun the light; and this was a dark and ignorant deed. We are not to be told that when a Government has to contend with a deficiency in the revenue, economy is inevitable. We know all this. But there is a profligate economy as well as a wise economy, and an economy which preferentially cuts off the sources of religious and educational improvement among such a people as those of Sierra Leone, is a profligate economy. If the deficiency in the revenue complained of be something more than a mere temporary one, it ought to be met by a general reduction of expenditure, and a lopping off of some of those unnecessary excrescences which are sure to develop themselves everywhere during a period of prosperity. When we cursorily noticed the falling off in the revenue a few months ago, we pointed out especially one branch of the public service in the Colony towards which the pruning-knife might be applied without any injurious results. That branch is the legal one. Chief Justice French has worthily earned advancement in the public service; and we repeat that two Judges of the Supreme Court are not needed for such a population as that of Sierra Leone. We shall be told, perhaps, that dishonesty is very prevalent, and that it is a most litigious population. We know this. We are not, however, of opinion that the latter characteristic should be indulged by any Government to the extent of providing increased facilities for its gratification. Circumstances have greatly changed since Chief Justice French was sent out to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone was then to be a Court of Appeal for the whole Coast; and it may be said there was not then any native local Bar. Sierra Leone is now no longer the metropolis of the West Coast, and there is an ample supply of native legal talent. The Court of Appeal has never been constituted, and there can be no reason why Sierra Leone, as regards judicial'}, {'id': 3376, 'article_title': 'The Administration of Justice in Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'The Administration of Justice in Gambia', 'last_edit_date': '07-10-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1877#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_09_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—I have read your able article in the African Times of the 2nd inst., on ""Judicial Arrangements on the West Coast,"" and can bear out all that it advocates, and especially endorse what you say about the necessity of a judge going circuit to the various settlements as a check on the local courts.

Poor Lefevre was arrested at his house early one morning, and brought handcuffed to the police-station, charged in a matter in which the court had no jurisdiction. Evidently the warrant was illegal; but when the case was brought before Chief Justice French, that judge, to the astonishment of every one, held Edwards was not responsible for the arrest; so that Lefevre got no redress for the illtreatment to which he had been so unjustly subjected.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Petition for a Court of Appeal in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Humble Petition of the Inhabitants of Sierra Leone, to the Right Honourable Earl Granville, K.G., Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, soliciting the establishment of a Court of Appeal in the Colony.\n\nMay it please your Lordship,—That during a period of eighty years the colony of Sierra Leone enjoyed the priceless advantage of trial by jury, without a single proved abuse upon their part, and that three years ago this great right was abruptly withdrawn from them at the suggestion of Governor Blackall, sustained by ex-Chief Justice Carr, who for a quarter of a century presided over juries in this country, and never found fault with verdicts until the eve of his leaving our colony for ever upon an ample pension.\n\nWe beg most respectfully to remind your lordship that this is the eighth petition arising out of the withdrawal of trial by jury which has already reached the Colonial-office, and that the illegal and oppressive sentences passed by a judge in this colony presiding without the safeguards of a jury have just been brought under the notice of the House of Commons and established the necessity of a solemn inquiry.\n\n—That we deeply regret to inform your lordship that in the absence of trial by jury, we have lost all confidence in the administration of law in our courts of justice, a state of things eminently destructive to the hitherto advancing interests of our settlement.\n\nThat the enormity of the withdrawal of our constitutional rights of trial by jury is still further increased by the absence of all courts of appeal in this colony, and a memorable instance has just been furnished to the House of Commons in the case of one Thomas, who underwent 150 lashes and one year's imprisonment contrary to law, and had no appeal against the barbarous and inhuman sentence, unless to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, at an expense of 300l. or 400l.\n\nThat in the debate to which we have the honour to allude, the right honourable gentleman the Under-secretary for the Colonies distinctly declared that examining into the decisions of judges formed no portion of the duties of the Colonial-office, which statement affords a still further justification for establishing a court of appeal in our settlement, in place of, in our utter hopelessness, being compelled to inundate the Colonial-office with petitions to save ourselves from illegal and barbarous prosecutions.\n\nThat the genius of the age favours the wide-spread establishment of courts of appeal, and even in England, upon matters of fact and evidence quite independent of law, the proper authorities, it is said, are about to relieve the Home-office of its hitherto irksome duties upon this head, and establishing in its stead a properly constituted court of appeal."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1869#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trial by Jury in Crown Colonies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have received from Sierra Leone a copy of a pamphlet, entitled ""The Cry of the People of Sierra Leone,"" for the restoration of the Jury-system in civil actions.

1484,"Colonial legal systems in Africa were often criticized for lacking transparency and due process, relying on circumstantial evidence without thorough investigation, leading to potential miscarriages of justice.","The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles both provide insights into the criticisms of colonial legal systems in Africa, particularly regarding their lack of transparency and due process. The textbook highlights the imposition of European judicial institutions that prioritized punishment over redress, potentially leading to miscarriages of justice. It specifically notes the French system's inequitable indigénat, which allowed administrators to impose punishments without thorough investigation, aligning with the claim of reliance on circumstantial evidence. However, the textbook does not explicitly address the lack of transparency or due process concerning circumstantial evidence. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed examples supporting the claim, such as the absence of key witnesses in court cases, exemplified by the omission of a crucial witness in Mr. Rainy's case. The articles also criticize the dual role of the Queen's Advocate as both prosecutor and judge, raising concerns about impartiality, and highlight cases with delayed or biased verdicts, like Lefevre v. Edwards, which favored a European merchant. Additionally, the abolition of trial by jury is noted as undermining justice and favoring European officials.

Together, these sources provide a comprehensive view of the criticisms leveled against colonial legal systems in Africa, emphasizing their lack of transparency and due process.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several insights into the colonial legal systems in Africa, which align with the claim that these systems were often criticized for lacking transparency and due process. The text highlights the imposition of European judicial institutions that were primarily focused on punishment rather than redress, which could lead to potential miscarriages of justice. The French system, in particular, is noted for its inequitable element, the indigénat, which allowed French administrators to impose punishments without thorough investigation, supporting the claim of reliance on circumstantial evidence. Additionally, the text mentions the erosion of African authority and the imposition of personal taxes, which were disturbing colonial institutions. However, the text does not explicitly discuss the lack of transparency or due process in terms of circumstantial evidence, which is a specific aspect of the claim. Overall, the textbook provides a broader context of criticism towards colonial legal systems, aligning with the claim but lacking specific details on the use of circumstantial evidence.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that colonial legal systems in Africa were often criticized for lacking transparency and due process, and for relying on circumstantial evidence without thorough investigation, leading to potential miscarriages of justice. The articles highlight instances where key witnesses were not produced in court, as seen in the case involving Mr. Rainy, where the absence of a crucial witness, the female servant, was noted as a significant omission. Additionally, the articles discuss the problematic role of the Queen's Advocate, who could act as both prosecutor and judge, raising concerns about impartiality and fairness. There are also mentions of cases where verdicts were delayed or seemed biased, such as the case of Lefevre v. Edwards, where the verdict was unexpectedly in favor of a European merchant. Furthermore, the articles criticize the abolition of trial by jury, which was seen as a move that undermined justice and favored European officials.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Kidd and M'Coskry, of Liverpool. His victim was a little girl eight years of age. We cannot enter into the filthy details, though all the evidence is before us. He was tried on the 6th of the present month. The result is, in our opinion, disgraceful to the jury, and not so creditable as we could wish to the judge. How any jury could, upon the evidence, have acquitted Lubley of the *rape*, when among other conclusive evidence it was proved that the poor child was bleeding during four days, we cannot possibly conceive. But we hope to get some explanation of this. Having, however, thus escaped upon the capital charge, he pleaded *Guilty* to that of criminal assault with attempt, &c.; and here, again, his good fortune did not desert him.

Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Petition for Re-establishing Trial by Jury in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Your petitioners would beg most respectfully to assure your lordship that the motives which led to sweeping away of one of the chief rights of Her Majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects in this settlement were other than they were represented to be.

The jury would not convict; they could not agree, there being a minority for acquittal. The cases were fully stated in our columns, by the prosecutor on the one hand, and Mr. Thomas Quin, foreman of the jury, and one of the dissenting minority, on the other. The latter expressed his firm conviction of the innocence of the accused, exposed certain errors on the part of the Chief Magistrate, and stated his belief that when the trials were resumed, as they were to be, before the Chief Justice from Sierra Leone, the ruling of the Judge would be in favour of the prisoners, and they would be again acquitted. And this proved to be correct. Meanwhile, however, the official and European elements had lost no time in dealing with the matter. An Ordinance was framed and sent home for approval, abolishing trial by jury in criminal cases of that description, and substituting therefor trial by the Chief Magistrate and two Commissioners or two Justices of the Peace. The native traders, in a body, memorialized the Secretary of State against such a change in the law, praying him to disapprove of the same. If the following, which came by the last mail, be correct, and we see no reason for disbelieving it, the decision has gone against them. The Earl of Derby is stated to have replied: ""I have to request you to inform the memorialists that I have read their memorial; that I cannot attach any weight to the charge which they make against the Judges and the Magistrates in the West African settlements of partiality in the administration of justice, unsupported by any instances of alleged miscarriage of justice; and that I see no reason to reverse my predecessor\'s decision that an alteration of the law as to the mode of trial of the particular offences in question is desirable.""', 'last_edit_date': '1883-04-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_04_1883#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Case of Gross Injustice at Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—For four years and more you have been the brave champion of Africans; have defended them against the oppression and acts of injustice they, from time to time, have received at the hands of their European rulers in Africa.

""A young man, by name Moses (R. E. Moses), purchased a cask or two of rum from one of the wholesale merchants in this town. At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'VERDICTS OF JURORS AT THE GAMBIA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We inserted in our last number a letter from Bathurst giving account of the deliberations of a Gambia jury on the case of a man indicted for robbing his alleged master.

M\'Collo N\'Jie, the evidence being clear that the man had dealt unfairly with the proceeds of the goods of the prosecutor, the jury would not agree to find him guilty, and were discharged without a verdict. Of course, as the evidence is not before us, we take it for granted that, as stated by our correspondent, the ""case was clear"" against the prisoner.

Mr. J. said that no doubt the man had not acted honestly. He had bought a horse with his master\'s goods, and then paid that away to a man for a debt due by prisoner some years ago.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year. Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko. The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In practical life the ascendancy of this racist theory led to a policy of denying Africans, no matter how well educated, equal rights and oppor› tunities with the whites in the colonial service. In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'However, we find that even in the Muslim emirates of Northern Nigeria where it would appear there was a harmony of interests between the colonial power and the emirs, the union between the European and indigenous administrative systems was never organic. The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

It would have been absurd to have tried Warren Hastings in India, or the notorious Eyre in Jamaica. In minor instances the spirit of the English law recognises the wisdom embodied in this principle, and the change of venue to avoid the jaundiced form of prejudice is occasionally resorted to. Palmer was not tried in Stafford because it was well known that his desperate career had created an unrelenting prejudice against him, nor was Keppel tried on board of his vessel nor in the presence of the fleet that advised him. Thus in every instance, from the most exalted to the lowest, in every case where justice may be interrupted in her stern and majestic course by human infirmity, the change of venue becomes justified. If this be necessary in England and her most enlightened colonies, how much more absolutely necessary in primitive settlements like ours, where the European wields an absolute and too often an unscrupulous power. Does anyone believe, outside of a madhouse, that if the Court at Sierra Leone was recognised under its present enlightened Chief Justice as a Supreme Court of Jurisdiction to which the people of Cape Coast could resort for justice as a matter of course, that unhappy Finlason would have suffered as he has from the foul antics of the little Nero of Cape Coast and his silly judge? It is true that when these delinquents visit Sierra Leone legal proceedings may be taken against them, but the poor plaintiffs must give security for costs, else the action cannot be proceeded with here; moreover these visits may take place after the period prescribed by law to bring the actions, and the unfortunate sufferers would be left without any legal remedy. We could cite countless instances that have occurred on the Coast where officials dressed out in a little brief authority certainly have done deeds, to use Shakespeare\'s expressive words, to ""make angels weep."" The atrocities of Cape Coast powerfully awake our attention to this grave subject, and we shall not fail at an early opportunity to resume it. Meanwhile we respectfully recommend it to the notice of our distinguished supreme ruler, and we have no doubt that if a law be passed giving jurisdiction to our Supreme Court over these cases it would quickly put a stop to the cruelties of Judge Parker at unhappy Cape Coast.—*Sierra Leone Interpreter.*'}, {'id': 1507, 'article_title': 'Official Correspondence re Mr. Justice Huggins', 'full_section_title': 'Official Correspondence re Mr. Justice Huggins', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1869#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_03_1869', 'content': ""My Lord Duke,—His Excellency Governor Sir Arthur Kennedy, O.B., has done me the honour to communicate to me against Mr. Justice Huggins, and, under ordinary circumstances, I should not feel myself justified to trespass another communication upon your Grace upon the same subject.

If all the natives of that colony were to join our enemies, the Ashantis, in disgust at English injustice, it ought not to cause us the smallest surprise. Our courts of law in Freetown—if the facts be as described—are merely stages whereon justice is made into a cruel farce. The lawyers of the colony, it seems, have so far forgotten what is due to their honourable profession as universally to accept retaining fees of 10l. annually from the leading firms and wealthier residents in the place, engaging themselves not to appear against them in any action. The consequence, of course, is that when a native desires to sue one of these firms or individuals, he finds not a single counsel free to undertake his case. And further, the negro, if he attempts to fight his own cause in the court, is immediately met by a demurrer to set aside his motion as irregularly brought forward, and he is left wholly without redress.

Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

If there be one thing more than another, after efforts for the spread of Christian education, that Great Britain owes to the people in her West African Settlements, it is that she should place within their reach an enlightened and adequate administration of justice. Justice according to British laws, dispensed by competent, pure, and honourable men such as have created and maintained the high reputation of the judicial bench in Great Britain, must necessarily offer so strong a contrast to the barbarous procedures, the venality, the oppression, and general iniquity of native tribunals, that it would be a powerful preacher of that Christian civilisation whose humane and equitable laws it would interpret, and with the assistance of the executive enforce. It may also be affirmed that there is no other part of the vast colonial possessions of this country in which such an administration of justice would be more fully appreciated than in those settlements. Thanks to the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies, there has grown up a large body of educated men, who, possessing all that spirit of litigation for which the African races are proverbial, are peculiarly sensitive as to their individual rights under British Laws, and very keen in detecting their infringement by incompetent, biased, and tyrannical magistrates and judges. The extent to which our editorial table has been laden with complaints of partiality, to an extent which we consider criminal, at Bathurst and at Lagos, of a mad, capricious, and subservient tyranny at Cape Coast and Accra, and of incompetency, ignorance, and impurity at Sierra Leone, bears ample testimony on these points; and forces this subject of a competent judicial staff at Sierra Leone for the whole Coast irresistibly on our consideration. Many things have combined of late to make necessary a total change in the system of administering justice in these places. The appointment of a Governor-in-Chief over all the settlements; the increasing facilities of steam communication; the abolition of Supreme Courts and of Queen's Advocates at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos; the lower qualifications of the cheap chief magistrates (dear at any price) who have replaced the old Supreme Court Judges; the iniquitous abolition of trial by jury in civil causes all along the Coast, at the instigation of those official conspirators against the rights and liberties of the African people, Blackall, Carr, and Huggins; and, finally, the creation at Sierra Leone of a Supreme Court of Appeal for all the settlements, have effected a chaotic, and, if it were not so oppressive and in many respects disgraceful, we should add a ridiculous revolution in all that appertains to the administration of British Law. The evils have now become so flagrant, that it is time order should be educed out of this chaos—that the majesty of justice should supersede the harlequinade—and that the lives, liberties, purses of British subjects, and others living under British rule, should be no longer allowed to remain in peril, from ignorance, prejudice, avarice, mad inebriety, and subservience and licentious tyranny in the little high places of British West Africa. It seems to us that there is only one way in which this order can be obtained. The necessary consequence, whether it was foreseen or not, of establishing a Court of Appeal in Civil Causes at Sierra Leone was that there must be three judges of the Supreme Court. Any Court of Appeal there formed of a less number of judges is simply ridiculous. To this it will be said Sierra Leone does not require three Supreme Court judges; and it would be unfair and unpopular to burden her revenues with so costly a judicial establishment. Because to be efficient it must be costly; to be such as the honour and reputation and duty of Great Britain demand that it should be, the judges must be superior men—men of the stamp and acquirements of the present Chief Justice French, who has under most unfavourable circumstances redeemed the Supreme Court, so far as he is himself concerned, from the opprobrium that rested upon it. Of course no brightness of legal reputation in him will make that of Mr. Huggins clear. For three men of the stamp of Judge French, 6,000l. a-year is indispensable—viz., 2,500l. a-year to the Chief Justice, and 2,000l. and 1,500l. to the second and third judge. It could not be expected that Sierra Leone should pay this 6,000l. a year. The three judges, though requisite for the Court of Appeal, are not indispensable for local service. The two junior judges should therefore be charged with the judicial service of the other settlements, making regular circuits, effecting gaol deliveries and trying civil causes, as is done by the judges of assize in England. Under the old system of Supreme Courts, the judicial salaries, including the Queen's Advocates for Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, would not be less than 4,000l. to 4,500l. a-year. It is not, therefore, too much to demand that the salaries of the two junior judges should be paid by them, with an addition of 500l. a-year to the local salary of the Queen's Advocate at Sierra Leone for performing the duty of Crown prosecutor at those settlements whenever the judges may be on circuit there. The increasing facilities of communication on the Coast are already so great that there would be no difficulty in effecting by these means a gaol delivery every three or four months at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. This constant supervision of the judges on circuit over the acts of the local magistracy would render the present offices of Chief Magistrate at Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos unnecessary, and they might be forthwith abolished, to the very great benefit of those places; for although there have not been any mad enormities at Bathurst and Lagos to bring the courts into such loathing and contempt among the people as we have seen elsewhere, there has been a marked partiality for the European over the native (shown flagrantly in the notorious case of Lubly) amounting to practical injustice and inflicting a deep and grievous sense of wrong.\n**December 23, 1868.**"", 'last_edit_date': '1868-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are two essentials in the administration of justice: the one is that it should be pure, enlightened, and impartial; the other, that the people among whom it is administered should believe it to be so. Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is very possibly thought in home official circles that, as so many abuses have been corrected in West African administration since this journal first entered on its arduous task of cleansing the then Augean Stable, there cannot be any room for well-grounded complaint at the present time. But it should be remembered in that elevated sphere that, although the British Government authorities have almost entirely ignored the subject of Education, and that, if it had depended solely on them, the people of the British West Coast Settlements would at the present time be almost as ignorant as were their forefathers at the time when the Foreign Slave Trade was finally suppressed on the West African Coasts, other agencies have been steadily at work; that the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies have been educating the people, many of whom, also, through success in trading enterprise, have been able to obtain for themselves and their offspring the advantages of British culture in England and Scotland. And again, that, although so many abuses have been corrected, the old leaven of irresponsibility from which they spring, still remains; and that, although the public exhibition of its fruits—licentiousness, favouritism, and tyranny—has been in some measure restrained, that fruit still grows, and adds a new taint to the foul moral atmosphere of the Settlements. The letters and papers from the West Coast which we have from time to time published, and which we select from a host of such documents, show that a constant censorial vigilance over Administrative acts and conduct is still imperatively necessary, if those Settlements are to be pushed forward on the road of civilization. We have had occasion in late numbers of this journal to expose and comment upon the so-called administration of justice there. Our Lagos letters in this August number reopen the question, and expose a system of abuse of the forms of justice that arouses in us a strong feeling of indignation. We are jealous for the true fame of Great Britain. We would have our country sans peur et sans reproche; and it grieves our heart when we see that those who are entrusted with executive and legal powers abuse these in the shameful manner we have had and now again have to expose. Look at the picture shown by our Lagos correspondent. We have in a recent number called upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to limit the powers of Queen’s Advocates on the West Coast, to pay them an adequate salary, and to prohibit their appearing before the Courts as counsel in any but criminal cases where the prosecution really is by the Executive authorities. If this reform be not effected the stream of justice will continue to be poisoned at its source, and instead of being a purifying will be a poisonous and corrupting one. There are now in all the Settlements barristers-at-law who have been legally educated and taken their degrees in England, and the field of private practice ought to be left open entirely for these educated Africans, who in not a few instances have given proof of high ability and of legal knowledge fully on a par with the majority of Europeans who accept legal and judiciary functions in those countries. Then again, it has become quite time that what are called “local-made solicitors,” should be dispensed with. These self-constituted lawyers were perhaps necessary before young Africans legally educated in England went out to the Coast to practise. We have said perhaps the self-constituted lawyers, to whom renewable certificates were eventually given, might have been necessary, although we have had but too ample evidence from the Coast of the venality of most of these men, and of the shamelessness with which they plundered, and, when it could be made to their advantage, sold their clients. But whatever necessity, real or fancied, may have existed in the past, there can be no longer any need of the employment of those semi-legal bloodsuckers. We say without hesitation that certificates to these men should no longer be renewed. The employment by one of them in Lagos as clerk and interpreter (see letter, “Public Opinion”) of a man who has been notorious for fraud, and more than once convicted of felony, is a scandalous insult to the population among whom he is thus authorized and allowed to “practise.” This is a matter that should be looked to by the local authorities; while the limitation of the powers of Queen’s Advocates, who frequently become acting judges during the absence on leave of occupants of the Bench, ought to be without delay effected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But it is not alone in the administration of justice that gross abuses exist. The Executive fails in its obvious duty on many points. We shall only mention one or two here, although their name is legion, and in this we confine ourselves still to Lagos. How often have we pointed out that Lagos should be a focus of civilization, whence precept and example should act on the intelligent barbarism of the Egba and Yoruba countries; and how greatly we have had to deplore that such civilizing influence has never yet been exerted. And we can scarcely now hope that within our time it will be exerted. We had hoped, too, that the publication of a well-conducted paper in Lagos, the Lagos Times, would have given a voice to public opinion sufficiently strong to lead to the correction of such abuses as that which has been strongly brought before us of the neglect to light the streets of Lagos. Well-lighted streets would constitute a difference between Lagos and the interior heathen towns that every visitor from the interior would see, and would speedily appreciate. And yet such is the culpable lethargy of the Executive, in or over which the educated native public of Lagos has no power, that, although the lamps and appliances for adequately lighting Lagos throughout have been procured and do exist, no lighting takes place except in the immediate neighbourhood of Government House and the adjoining residences of some principal officials and merchants. This is a scandalous remissness on the part of the Executive, and the more scandalous because the police of Lagos is distributed, or rather concentrated, on the same principle and in the same locality as the light. By this ingenious process on the part of the authorities the greater portion of the town is made over to darkness and depredators, and has become most notoriously unsafe both for persons and property. Burglary, robbery, and violence are said to be of nightly occurrence. There seems to be a rather large criminal element among the Lagos population; and most certainly, with a local revenue of some £50,000 a year, this ought to be kept adequately in check by street lights and a sufficiently numerous, good, and well-distributed police. That it is not so is a disgrace to the Executive authorities, a reproach to British rule, and leads us moreover to ask the question whether the time has not arrived at which some independent native element should be admitted to the Executive and Legislative Council. There are many local quicksands which a European Executive cannot discover; many local wants with which a European Executive will not sufficiently, if at all, sympathize. The addition of a thoroughly independent elected native element in the Council would bring in that knowledge and sympathy, and would be tending in the direction indicated by the House of Commons Committee of 1864-5, preparing the natives for self-government, under, of course, the sovereign control of Great Britain. Education, by the action of Missionary High Schools in West Africa, and the constantly deepening stream of youth sent by their parents to England for medical, legal, and general instruction, is really making considerable progress among a section of the population of the Settlements, as indicated by the gradual formation of local Bars, constituted by members of the Temple and Lincoln’s Inn; by the increasing number of medical practitioners who are members of the London and Edinburgh College of Surgeons and Physicians; and not least in importance by the number of young men who have been sent to England to be educated in the higher branches of learning, and who are now returning to their native land to take their part in the work of civilization and progress. It is to these men that we must look for the future development of the West African Settlements, and it is to them that the British Government must look for the future maintenance of its influence and authority in those regions. The time has come when the British Government must recognize the fact that the West African Settlements are no longer mere outposts of Empire, but are becoming integral parts of the British dominions, with a population that is rapidly advancing in intelligence and civilization, and that is entitled to a voice in the management of its own affairs. The sooner this is recognized, the better it will be for all concerned.\n**91**', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Judicial Establishments on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are authorized to state that the whole question of the Judicial Establishments on the West Coast of Africa is under consideration by Her Majesty's Government.

We beg the particular attention of our readers also to the contents of the letter above alluded to, a copy of which will be found on p. 113. It is not our purpose here to make any remarks on those contents, but we hope and believe that we have stated the case of the West African settlements and their people clearly and faithfully, although necessarily with much brevity. The space occupied in our columns by that letter will in this present number abridge the usually reserved by us for leaders; and force us to postpone the consideration of several topics now ripe and calling for remark. But it seems to us that there is at this time a crisis in West African affairs, which may eventuate in great good or prolonged evil, in proportion as wise counsels have sway with governors and people; and that all possible exertion on our part is required in order that the good may be inaugurated, and the evil dispersed. Our African readers will do well at the same time to bear in mind that a heavy duty and responsibility weighs on them, as well as on those to whom God has given the supreme rule over them. The conduct of a government will be more or less shaped by the more or less persistent and intelligent interest shown by the people in public affairs; by the more or less persistent demand on their part for measures and privileges to which an advancing people is justly entitled; and which are requisite as a stimulus to further progress. We use our best efforts for the people of the West African settlements; but we cannot do everything for them. Their co-operation is indispensable for obtaining measures, concessions, and even rights to which they have a just claim. Some of our friends at Cape Coast have of late been doing their duty nobly, with enlightened zeal and firmness, tempered by modesty and discretion. We hope those in other settlements will profit by the example. Sierra Leone would not then be content to sit in disgraceful apathy without any one of the grievances of which she many times complained having been redressed; without having made a single step forward towards financial self-government; without the removal of an officially condemned judge; without the re-establishment of that trial by jury which is as indispensable in civil as it is in criminal cases, if all classes of the people are to have protection against oppression and wrong. We were present at the sittings of the West African Parliamentary Committee (House of Commons Committee)—we heard the evidence as to alleged abuse of the right of trial by jury in civil causes—we have examined and re-examined that evidence, as well as the official letters of the great conspirators against the African people in this important matter—Blackall, Huggins, and Carr—and we do not hesitate to affirm not only that no sufficient ground for the confiscation of trial by jury was shown, but also that never, so far as we can historically remember, was a people deprived of an important civil right on such meagre suspicions and inconclusive evidence. But if the community of Sierra Leone sit with folded arms in presence of that great wrong, and the other wrongs therewith connected, thinking that they have compensation in the official nomination of two of them, certainly not the most intellectually worthy, to the empty title of ""honourable,"" the continuance to them of which depends on their constant subserviency to the executive will, all we can do for them is to show them from time to time their grievous error; and wait and watch for their awakening to a due sense of the contempt that will soon be felt for them by the more actively advancing communities of the Gold Coast and Lagos; which, so far as we may judge by the evidence in our hands, increasing by each successive mail, will throw them completely into the shade as regards that intelligent comprehension of, and regard for those political rights and liberties, without which no people are ever likely to be well governed, or to have their personal freedom and security sufficiently guaranteed.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1872#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Judicial Staff at Sierra Leone for the Whole West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The same fountain cannot give forth bitter waters and sweet; if the source be not pure, the stream cannot be so.

Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The main objectives were to render the colonial system less oppressive, less dehumanizing and to make it beneficial to the Africans as well as the Europeans. African leaders sought the correction of such specific measures and abuses as forced labour, high taxation, compulsory cultivation of crops, land alienation, pass laws, low prices of agricultural products and high prices of imported goods, racial discrimination and segregation, and to improve inadequate facilities such as hospitals, pipeborne water and schools.\nThese grievances against the colonial system were felt, it should be emphasized, among all classes of society, the educated as well as the illiterate and the urban as well as the rural dwellers, and generated a common con› sciousness among them as Africans and black men as opposed to their oppressors, the colonial rulers and the white men. It is during this period that we see the strengthening of African political nationalism which had its beginnings immediately after the completion of the establishment of the colonial system in the 1910s.\nThe articulation of this feeling and the leadership of the movement, which during the period up to the 1910s was the responsibility of the traditional authorities and developed within the framework of the precolonial political structures, was now assumed by the new educated elite groups or members of the new middle class. Those new leaders were, rather paradoxically, the products of the colonial system itself, created and sus› tained through the schools and the administrative, mining, financial and commercial institutions that it introduced. It is the concentration of the leadership of the nationalist and anti-colonialist activities in the hands of the educated Africans who lived mainly in the new urban centres which has led to the incorrect identification of African nationalism in the inter-war period exclusively with that class and its characterization as primarily an urban phenomenon.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""Having been told that they had no history worth taking seriously, and conscious of the fact that their own socio-economic group had limited opportunities in the colonial system, it is perhaps not surprising that the nationalist intelligentsia came to prefer a visionary 'West African national› ity' to a political system in which they had no voice and which, in any case, was alien and therefore, in their view, oppressive. Gold Coast news› papers never tired of denouncing alien rule. As one of the editorials observed: 'The introduction of the British system of government in place of the one existing before was an encroachment which no self-respecting nation would allow'.\nIn spite of all the objection to 'alien rule', however, there was never any mention of severing relations with the colonial power; alien rule was bad but there were good reasons for consenting to it; it was better to demand more opportunities for a particular social group and make moderate demands than to do away with alien rule completely; and one could still be 'free', 'under the Union Jack'.

The petition also dealt with the local problems that the colonial administration created for the people, such as the compulsory rebuilding of sanitary huts to prevent plague and the banning of the growing of cotton and coffee by Africans. Finally, it put forward programmes for improvement, asking the administration to expand the training facilities for hospital orderlies, for the building of a high school, and for the setting up of a school for girls.

To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > Struggles to recover dignity', 'content': 'The decade following the First World War was an important period because of the growing awareness displayed throughout the country in the prepara› tion and consolidation of a national movement.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.58, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in North-East Africa,', 'section_title': 'Somaliland > Local protest movements', 'content': ""distribution or grazing needs.

The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.577, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The nineteenth-century Islamic revolutions in West Africa', 'section_title': 'The Community of the Faithful in dar al-Hidjra', 'content': 'Undoubtedly, the reformers had an overwhelming advantage over their adversaries.

If there was ever a time when a wise and upright judicial administration among these settlements was needed the present is that time. The workings of the courts are not only unsatisfactory, but scandalous and disgraceful, and your petitioners see no other way for reforming the abuses than by restoring trial by jury. There are 45,000 natives and less than 100 Europeans in the settlement. Some of the most powerful of the latter are banded together in a party, and this party is not satisfied with controlling the country, but now seeks to domineer over the coloured race. Some of the European residents here evidently believe that since the Africans are deprived of their jury their every right is gone, and they are to be treated as mere chattels. On the other hand, the coloured people are convinced that, with Mr. Huggins on the bench, they can never hope for justice and under this conviction whenever an attempt at assault is made on them they return the assault, instead of seeking redress in a court of justice as heretofore.

Your petitioners are induced to believe that if such an inquiry were granted, your lordship, from the facts which would necessarily be elicited, would be convinced without a doubt that the reasons alleged for abolishing trial by jury were unfounded, and had no existence except in the imagination of a few who wished the institution out of the way in order to give full play to their unbridled passions.

Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

Is that the way the white people mean continually to treat us, to make us respect, fear, and honour them?""

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_. We believe so too. For this reason, among others, we insert his complaint. We cannot afford to have the game of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast played over again at Lagos.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We feel this very strongly at the present moment. In this number of our journal we have put on record the demand made by us for compensation to the victims of the late political persecutions at Cape Coast, and the reply of the Secretary of State thereto. This reply is in the stereotyped official form—the application for compensation ought to come through the local authorities—or, in plain English, through those very officials who have committed the acts and inflicted the injuries complained of, and for which compensation is justly sought. We do not hesitate to say that this rule of the Colonial Service, as it is called—but to which ought to have been added, ""as regards Crown colonies""—lies at the very root of the flagrant misdoings of West Coast officials that we have had so often to expose. But for the interference of the African Times this rule gives up the people of the settlements, bound hand and foot, into the power of a few British Government officials; men for the most part, as we have shown by exposure of their acts and deeds, quite unfitted to be the depositories of such power. What should we say about the police authorities in our streets if it were laid down as a rule by the Home-office that a man who has been robbed must demand justice only through the man who has robbed him; or if a magistrate, when appealed to for protection and justice against a policeman who had abused the power with which he had been entrusted, should reply, ""This demand must come through the policeman, such being the rule of the Home-office""? The thing is monstrous. By refusing to listen to a complaint against a Crown colony official for acts of oppression by him committed, save and except through the medium of that same official, the home authorities identify themselves at the very outset with the official complained of. Their reply to the applicant seems to say, ""You had better either submit quietly, or make peace directly with him, for he is a privileged person, whom we can only condemn provided he sees fit to condemn himself."" Can any reasonable man wonder, after this, that British officials in the West Coast Settlements, which rank as Crown settlements or colonies, should, by lying misrepresentations, continually seek to draw tighter and tighter the fetters that bind the people over and among whom they are appointed to exercise Crown authority? that every such British official should strenuously impede the creation of an elective legislature, by the existence of which alone that arbitrary rule of the Colonial Service can be overpassed? The colonies or settlements under this atrocious system (Crown-colonies or settlements) are happily now but very few in number; and this it is which increases the difficulty with which we have to contend; because if there were many of them we might obtain an associated action that would have weight in Parliament. Under these circumstances it would be wrong to flatter ourselves or the people of the West African Settlements with the belief that we can directly overcome that justice-barring rule of the Colonial-office. All we can do is to take care that the complaints and demands thus made through inculpated officials shall not be burked. This involves the necessity of a duplicate—an exact copy of every complaint or demand forwarded to the Secretary of State, through the local administrator or other authority—being sent at the same time to us, together with the documents or evidence upon which the complaint or demand is based, which justify such demand or complaint and establish a claim to redress. This is the course which we now advise Messrs. Fynn, Fynn, and Forson, and the lately imprisoned officials of the Fanti Confederation to pursue. We will back up their complaint when it shall have been ""forwarded through the local administrator, according to the rules of the Colonial Service,"" and will do our best in every way to obtain for them a just and liberal compensation.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Transported and Imprisoned Kings', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The most sacred portion of the duty of a free press is to strive to remedy injustice and wrong. We have throughout our editorial career earnestly endeavoured to perform this duty—not with so much success as we could have desired. Government servants, from the highest to the lowest, in Crown Colonies form a serried phalanx that it is difficult for any assailant to penetrate. There is an _esprit de corps_, from the lowest grade of European Crown Colony officials up to and including Downing-street, that has made it almost a superhuman task to procure redress for a wrong committed by the Executive of a Crown Colony. We have had but too much experience of this, our rebuffs having been such that nothing but a full conviction of our being right could have prevented our writing ourselves down as assininely incompetent to distinguish between good and evil, between right and wrong, between even-handed justice and flagrant oppression. Such has been the past in our editorial career. We fancy that we now see a gleam of light justifying in us a hope of better things to come. Some changes that have taken place at the Gambia, attributed to our efforts, are encouraging, as evidencing that the ear and judgment of the present Chief of the Colonial Office, the Earl of Kimberley, are not entirely monopolized by officialism; and in ruminating on the letter which we inserted in our last number, headed ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" we have ventured to indulge the hope that if the noble Secretary of State for the Colonies will only admit that the decisions and acts of the Governors of Crown Colonies are not infallible, we may yet obtain some atonement for injustice to some deeply injured persons. With this hope, and the ideas that have sprung from it, we give insertion in our present number to two other letters from Accra bearing on the same subject, of the gross injustice done to the Kings Tackie and Assafo Ajaye, and the deep national disgrace involved in it; for an oppression of the weak and helpless is a deep national disgrace. As such, it touches us nearly, and incites us to persistent action, seeing that we have now in office in England a Government bold and courageous in the cause of right, as evidenced in what they have recently done in the matter of the Transvaal, which no one in his senses could doubt the power of Great Britain to subdue and retain had she so determined. And as we have some faith in the equity of the present Home Government, so have we also in that of the new Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, Sir Samuel Rowe. We hope he will feel that he has nothing to do with the acts of his predecessors, and is not at all bound to uphold them where they were wrong, but, on the contrary, as having the honour of Great Britain in his hands, is bound, in duty to himself and to his country, to remove for the latter the stigma that attaches to her in the minds of thoughtful, impartial men, not only as regards the treatment of Kings Tackie and Assafo Ajaye, but also as regards that of King Ennemil Quow, of Wassaw, on whose behalf we in vain sent in our remonstrances to Downing-street during the Colonial Secretaryship of Sir M.

One of our Gambia correspondents, occupying a position which was in itself a guarantee for the correctness of any information he might give us, communicated that a commission of inquiry into the affairs of the hospital and alleged abuses there was to be appointed. We congratulated the Gambians on this decision, only demanding that the investigation should be a full, fair, and open one, and not a mere friendly official whitewashing affair. “Observer’s” letter informs us, and, through us, the Colonial-office and the public, that the Governor did really promise to have such an investigation made; that it was entered, or ordered to be entered, on the minutes of the Council; but that the Governor has since retracted his promise, denies its obligation being binding upon him, and refuses the commission! And yet this gentleman, whose term of office, under the colonial regulations, had expired, has, it is reported, been re-appointed under the new West Coast regulations, and, with a slight change of title, to another six years of rule. This needs no further remark from us, beyond the expression of a deep regret that the just expectations of the people have been disappointed in so many ways. But meanwhile some reforms are being carried into execution at the hospital, and for these we refer our readers to the very short letter of “A Native.” Small as these reforms seem to be, they are nevertheless an instalment procured through our giving voice in this journal to the complaints of those to whom the Colonial Hospital at Bathurst and\n\nits efficiency are matters of vital importance; and we will further venture to express the hope that a complete and radical removal of all abuses in it, and of all just complaints against its management, will be the ultimate result. We shall certainly endeavour to persevere until these results are obtained. Our correspondence has shown us in a very strong light how grateful the African people are everywhere along the Coast for kind sympathetic medical relief—it is a very easy way of gaining their affections—and we hope yet to see imitations everywhere of the noble and devoted care shown to these long-neglected people by a British medical officer at the Gold Coast whose conduct we felt it lately to be our duty and our privilege to eulogise.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Trial by Jury, Gambia.

Besides, the numerous instances on record of verdicts recovered for the Queen against persons of every nationality, colour, or rank, sufficiently refute the false and scandalous imputation thrown upon the integrity of the juries. Has a change then come over the spirit of the Bathurst juries? Your Memorialists trow not; but if it were so the change might be due to those occult and mysterious influences which work behind the bench.\n\n10. That your Memorialists are of opinion that the remedy proposed for this imaginary evil—viz., the substitution of a Court of Commissioners for a jury—is worse than the evil itself; because, if Bathurst juries are fallible and cannot be trusted, will the amalgamation of the offices of judge and jury in the persons of the Chief Magistrate and two Commissioners guarantee their infallibility? and are such Commissioners more likely to be unbiased and impartial than twelve honest and true men taken indifferently from the community at large?

That in reference to paragraph 1 of the Memorial, we are unable to quote any letter or portion of letter addressed to your Excellency by us the memorialists relative to the welfare of the Colony, beyond that embodied in the Memorial to the Acting Administrator, C. H. H. Moseley, Esq., and dated Sept. 19, 1893, to which we beg to refer your Excellency, together with his reply thereto of the 20th of same month.

But beyond the reply of Mr. Moseley, to which we refer you, our Memorial has been totally disregarded, and not so much as a letter on the subject has, up to the present, been received, although that Memorial touched upon one of our most vital interests—i.e., the sanitary well-being of the Colony. We also respectfully submit that besides the Memorial in question, our representatives, your non-official members of Council, have over and over again fruitlessly opposed schemes which their experience of the Colony had led them to foresee would, if carried out, be detrimental to its interests; that many a time projects seriously affecting the future of the Colony have been decided upon without so much as their advice and consent being asked, and unconstitutionally put to execution, much to their chagrin and annoyance and to our general discomfiture. We will also respectfully add that your Excellency has been continually apprised of the dissatisfaction of the Memorialists at the present regime through the local press; reminding your Excellency at the same time of the Meetings of the Board of Health in which the wishes and suggestions of those having the welfare of the Colony at heart were so ignored, or systematically opposed, that most of them were compelled to resign a position which had become untenable.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Both the new elite and the urban proletariat were important as agents making for change in rural colonial society, but the former were indis› putably the more important in the political, economic and social history of colonial Africa.

Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'But not all those classified as belonging to the new elite in colonial Africa owed their membership of that class to education, nor did all those who owed it to education attain a uniform standard. As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""Fundamental and destined to be lasting and felt by all members of the society, also, was the impact of colonialism in the political field.

Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads. But colonial rulers were compelled to restore African independence and sovereignty, as will be seen in the next volume, not to the traditional ruling elite but to the new elite or members of the upper and lower middle classes, the creation of the colonial system, and this situation is never going to be reversed. If anything, the chances of African traditional regal institutions being abolished altogether, as for example they have been in Guinea, are much greater than their retention let alone their rehabilitation.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

The pages of the monthly Mwigwithania were full of riddles, proverbs and stories which encouraged the readers to think of themselves as Gikuyu. This paper also narrated the day-to-day activities of the KCA in detail, thus bringing it to the attention of the readers. This cultural revival was to be intensified when a major quarrel broke out within the churches of Gikuyuland the following year.

During my last sojourn in England for two years, I witnessed your patriotic zeal, and have lost no opportunity of impressing upon the native gentlemen here the vast importance of the services rendered to their cause by the African Times. You will be delighted to hear that your advocacy of native rights is beginning to make itself felt, and that things begin to assume a more cheerful aspect. With the departure of Governor Blackall and our jury destroying ex-Chief Justice Carr, the spirit of public confidence, so essential to the advancement of a people, appears to visit us. The Judicial Bench, with one melancholy and deplor- able exception, never had so high a position as at the present under Chief Justice French; and it is rumoured that Sir Arthur Kennedy, our excellent Governor-in-Chief, will infuse the genius of a complete reform and regeneration into every department of the State. You may rely upon one thing at least, that such out- rages upon the persons of natives as the English Parliament was dishonoured by the recital of during last session never will occur upon this coast again. Sir Arthur Kennedy has established competitive examinations here, and by this step has, like a wise ruler, adopted the recognised spirit of the age and given an earnest proof of a sincere desire to see the loyal, industrious, and creditable natives advanced to places of position and trust. Er.\n\n## Governor Blackall never thought of this, but, on the contrary, he created a number of new offices, into one of which he placed his son, who performed the duty by deputy, whilst the others fell to the Ashwoods, Shaws, and Primels, and a host of other toadies and sycophants who are now a standing horror and menace to the natives. Nothing will do more to create an efficient staff of officials, to purify the public service, and deal a heavy death-blow against nepotism than this system of competitive examination; and the country owes a lasting debt of gratitude to his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief for the introduction of this system into our rising settlement. One of the worst evils attendant, too, upon such miserable appointments as those to which I allude as having been made by ex-Governor Blackall, is that the officials immediately bring a perfect brood of equally incompetent persons around them in the shape of relatives and friends, and the public service goes to complete and absolute ruin.\n\nThis is a subject of such vital importance, namely, the bestowal of Government appointments to the natives of Sierra Leone, that as soon as the great pressure of professional business admits of the opportunity, I will do myself the honour of addressing you at greater length upon it.—I am, Mr. Editor, yours truly,  \nW.

To gratify the vanity and morbid craving of a parasite, a useless schooner was ordered to be built at considerable expense. The expenses of the police, with a Bravo and the son of the ex-Governor at its head, were increased in inverse ratio to their utility. The useless office of Auditor-General was created for Mr. Primet, the ex-Governor\'s private secretary, with a salary of 600l. per annum, in direct violation of an established rule of the Colonial-office, which provides ""that appointments of gentlemen connected with the Governor, or who have accompanied him as private secretaries or otherwise, are open to much objection, and will rarely be confirmed."" The Petty Debt-court, which worked well under the presidency of a magistrate and a merchant, was abolished in order to make way for the appointment of Mr. Huggins, the most incompetent judge that ever disgraced the name of justice. Trial by jury, which England loves so well, fell, through the grossest misrepresentations ever transmitted to the Colonial-office in Downing-street. In assessing the tax on the huts occupied by the poor African labourers, the most unheard of cruelty was adopted—in one word, in a few years more such a blighting, demoralising, and despotic sway as that of Major Blackall would have destroyed the social advancement and civilisation of eighty years, and reduced Sierra Leone to a ""howling wilderness.""\n\nMr. Editor, I now turn from this disheartening and revolting picture of the past, and ask your readers, in the words of the philosophic Prince of Denmark, ""Look you now what follows.""

Competitive examination, the noblest emulation which a people can enjoy, has been established amongst us. All further expenses on the race-course have been put a stop to. The Legislative Council no longer sit with closed doors. Public works have been placed upon a healthy and sound footing. The police force has been put upon a far more efficient footing. Our learned and able Queen\'s Advocate is at this moment revising our colonial statutes, which are a disgrace to this settlement. Government officers are now sustained only when in the right.

To scatter abroad, through the aid of a missionary body, little bits of Scriptural history, or little compendia of Christian doctrine, however advisable this may be, is not sufficient for soundly educating the youths of a colony with a revenue of £8,000 per annum. We have at length, thank God, established a public school, under a most gifted inspector, Mr. Popplestone; and the Governor, with that wisdom which characterises all his public acts, has inaugurated the splendid and inspiriting system of competitive examination. A new and rising generation will thus see the Legislative Council enlarged, and the educated African having a voice in the little senate of his country. An educated people can never be an oppressed people any more than strong waters can be kept in complete subjection. When I contemplate the present social position of the African, he is found to be a mute and prostrate being, holding no office of high trust, and necessarily wielding no power in the State. Some little honour is, no doubt, now and then conferred upon him, but this ""empty trapping"" only tends more lucidly to show how utterly desolate his position is. I hail, then, the establishment of a sound school of education as a great and auspicious event in the history of Sierra Leone. No feeling we find in the records of nations spreads so rapidly as the thirst of knowledge; and in her luminous path justice to all parties must necessarily follow. What we spend in the promotion of education will be amply repaid to us in the lessening of crime and the support of our public criminals. I have over and over again inculcated this doctrine, but under the regime of the Blackall-Huggins Government I inculcated it in vain.

So strongly is this feeling expressed that the list of official appointments of Africans, which we insert on another page, is sent to us with the expression of doubt that we shall insert it. This is very unjust to us, and measuring us by a standard that ought not to be applied to us. So far from feeling any disinclination to do so, we are only too happy to insert anything that can place the many good official acts of the actual Administrator-in-Chief prominently beneath the eyes of all men, and we beg to thank our informant for putting us in possession of the means for showing all that has been done in the very important question of the filling the public offices in Africa with Africans.

As we understand the letter and complaints we inserted, it was not that a European had been admitted to an office instead of an African, but that he had been admitted without a competitive examination being held for establishing that he was more worthy by his attainments than any of the possible African candidates.

A conciliatory but firm and decided policy is now imperatively called for both on the Gold Coast and at Lagos; the development of great resources, and the continued advance of Christian civilization, depend on this: the Gambia requires a thorough revival; a reform in the expenditure of the revenues of Sierra Leone, the sanitary improvement of Freetown, the admission of the educated natives to a real share in the administration of their affairs, and the promotion of education and of useful public works, are required, both as a matter of justice and of good policy. We have heard that there is an energy of character in Governor Kennedy to carry out such changes, should he think them right, and find them practicable, notwithstanding any amount of official opposition he may encounter from the old lovers and upholders of abuses on the Coast. We do not think he would have allotted an additional 300l. a-year to the Rev. Mr. Hartshorn, the Colonial, Army, Navy, and Gaol Chaplain (we forgot the Gaol in our last number), that he might supervise the expenditure of 290l. a-year on education.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa. The colonial partition and conquest definitely resulted, as A. E. Afigbo has pointed out above (Chapter 19), in a revolutionary reshaping of the political face of Africa. In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""With the establishment of European administration, chiefs were manipulated as if they were administrative personnel who might be reposted or removed to satisfy colonial needs. Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century. This was the failure of the assimilationist or direct administration policy which was the vogue in the nineteenth century. Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere. It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools.

With the adoption of the principle of the sanctity of national boundaries by the Organization of African Unity, this appearance is not likely to be altered. Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads. But colonial rulers were compelled to restore African independence and sovereignty, as will be seen in the next volume, not to the traditional ruling elite but to the new elite or members of the upper and lower middle classes, the creation of the colonial system, and this situation is never going to be reversed. If anything, the chances of African traditional regal institutions being abolished altogether, as for example they have been in Guinea, are much greater than their retention let alone their rehabilitation. Thirdly, it was colonialism that gave birth to African nationalism which was the product of the sense of anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and alienation generated by the colonial system. Fourthly, one colonial legacy which again has already played such a decisive role in the politics of post-colonial Africa is the army. This institution is not likely to be abolished and, as will be seen in the next volume, it has already changed the course of the history of many an African country, and it seems as if it has not completed its political innings yet. 'The man on horseback', to borrow Finer's phrase,$^{55}$ is going to be with us for a long time and will serve as a constant reminder, if ever we need one, of the colonial episode. Finally, it appears that the judicial and political institutions - the courts, parliaments, regional and district commissioners, etc. - are going to be retained even though some modifications and adaptations have been and will continue to be made.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

In all communities, and among all nations, the strict and impartial administration of justice renders the people ruled oblivious to many of the faults of those\n\ngoverning; but where the fountains of justice are polluted and corrupt, the scope given to tyranny and oppression to exercise their undisputed sway is so great that they require to be checked by more than ordinary measures. It behoves therefore the powers that be, never to misgovern in such manner as to cause the governed to have recourse to other than legitimate and constitutional means.""}, {'id': 3328, 'article_title': 'Judicial Appointments at Lagos', 'full_section_title': 'Judicial Appointments at Lagos', 'last_edit_date': '04-09-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1877#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_06_1877', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—The new Judicature Act, or Supreme Ordinance, came into operation here on the 4th instant.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAW AND JUSTICE AT CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Affairs at Cape Coast are very far from being as they ought to be, and as we could desire that they should be. So strongly do we feel this, that we had intended to give a full review of the position this month. But although unable to do this, we cannot avoid noticing the facts contained in a letter from one of our correspondents there respecting certain proceedings in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court. The due and impartial administration of justice ought to be looked upon as a matter of the first consequence in a British colony or settlement. In the absence of a ""Secretary of State for the Department of Public Justice"" from the roll of British Ministers in Council, it devolves on the Colonial-office to be especially watchful and careful in this important matter. We believe that in a British colony or settlement, where there is no distinction of race, there will be found to prevail pretty generally such an administration of justice, because a community of British settlers will not bear to be trifled with in such things. But unhappily this is often far from being the case where the courts of justice are established principally for what is looked upon as an inferior race. We have seen too many examples of this. The sad outbreak in Jamaica was based upon the real or fancied oppression exercised by a district court, the decisions of which were taxed with partiality and consequently with injustice; and it is impossible for us to look with any satisfaction upon what is recorded in the above-mentioned letter as having taken place at Cape Coast. It must be borne in mind, too, that the circumstances at Cape Coast are exceptional, and exceptional in a particular which renders it tenfold more than ordinarily incumbent on the Colonial-office to provide against the possibility of any irregular proceedings or charge of injustice in the Cape Coast courts. Under the new decision of Downing-street, so far as we can gather these from facts and partial revelations, all that Cape Coast is to receive from Great Britain, in return for the customs and other duties, &c., exacted is an administration of justice—is the maintenance of open courts in which justice, in conformity with British law, shall be administered to colonists and natives. Yet, notwithstanding this, we had occasion to remark in past months on the seat of justice both in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court and in the Supreme Court being filled by officers of the West India Detachment quartered at Cape Coast Castle. Now this is in every respect indefensible. The Earl of Carnarvon (in his speech on the Jamaica question which appears in our columns), treating of courts-martial, says that ""these form at all times a very exceptional and very deplorable tribunal."" And why? Lord Carnarvon explains: ""No one will doubt this who considers the youth, the ignorance of the first principles of law, and very often the prejudices of their members."" We have eliminated what was irrelevant and inapplicable. And can any one doubt that these objections to the administration of justice by military officers are equally applicable when such officers are appointed to preside in the Supreme Court and the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court at Cape Coast, a locality in which, perhaps, because of peculiar climate, passions and prejudices seem to interfere, even under the most favourable circumstances, with the impartial administration of justice? Soon after this journal was established, four or five years since, we insisted on the necessity of some new arrangements at Cape Coast as regards official residence. We said then, and we say now, that the judges and magistrates ought not to be residents in the Castle with the Governor and military officers. A judge ought to be beyond the suspicion of partiality or bias, if his decisions are to be respected; and we are sorry to see that the Colonial-office have not made any change in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-09-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_09_1866#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BATHURST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—Owing to the great abuses reported repeatedly by ""The Gambian,"" and the gross injustice that has prevailed in the Gambia courts, one Mr. Reffie has been sent over to England by the black inhabitants of the River Gambia to study law, in order that he may be in some degree qualified to defend his fellow-countrymen from the injustice to which they are from time to time compelled to submit in the court of that colony.\n\nThe weight of the one branch of the Gambia law is equal to a waggon burden; but we shall still despair of obtaining justice if merchants and their clerks are to continue to be the magistrates and commissioners in their courts. What will the plea of a defendant avail, where the plaintiff sits on the bench as commissioner? How, and in what way, can a prisoner expect justice, where he is to be tried by the complainant? How, then, can justice be pursued in such court, where the plaintiffs and complainants, or their clerks, are to sit on the bench as magistrates and commissioners, to decide upon their own suits or charges? Here are three among the many great obstacles which stand in the way of justice in the Gambia court, and unless they be removed, things will never get on well in the colony, as you and Christian England would wish. I have twice had to appease attempts of mutiny in the said court, all from the same complaint of injustice.\n\nThe Gambia Court requires a paid magistrate, one who is independent of both black and white, but who will seek the interest of his employer, and the welfare of Her Majesty\'s colony. To secure justice, England must do away with the merchants and their clerks in the court, as they are not seeking the interest of the colony, but their own. And if this be continued, it will ultimately end with disgrace, and the downfall of a long-standing British colony.

But there is something yet required to be done, which I suggest will make great improvement in this small colony—that is, to reduce some of the large expenditure of the several departments. For instance, say the Secretary\'s department for one; five offices (including the Collector of Custom\'s branch) and the hire of the building cost 2,080l. a year (not including the subordinates). Really, you will agree with me that it is rather exorbitant for the part keeping up of only one department per annum in so small a colony as the Gambia; and more so, as the five officers are not all Europeans, who have received a sound English education, but mere boys, who even have not completed their African schooling.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Administration of Justice in the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Justice!

O Justice!!!\n\nSir,—Will you allow me space in your invaluable journal to inquire, What is justice? and why do judges sit in their seats to judge matters in controversy between two parties? I refrain from answering it myself. Justice, however, I say, may be found elsewhere, but not in the Court of the Gambia; for the Chief Magistrate, Mr. Chalmers, here, in deciding matters is certainly influenced by prejudices of feeling and partiality, favouring his colour (the European), and allowing himself to be guided by their opinion—e.g., an American sailor, who had murdered one of his shipmates by stabbing him in eleven places on his body, thereby causing his death, was tried, and, he being found guilty, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment without hard labour. Against this we have a recent case, tried last session, of a native lad of nine years who accidentally wounded another lad of fourteen. He was found guilty, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. The sailor is of a good old age, the other a lad. It is also rumoured in the town that Mr. Ingram, lately arrived from England, brought on a case against one George Lake, an old resident (native) of this colony, in a Court of Chancery, which court the inhabitants of this colony are ignorant of, and which, I believe, had never existed here before. Mr. Raffles, the attorney for Mr. Lake, went, it is said, to the Chief Magistrate, with Mr. Ingram, to show them that there is no such court here, for there are no officers appointed for such a court, and the papers, therefore, issued are wrong. What was the reply? It was, that such a court does exist here, and Mr. Chalmers pretends to nominate himself the judge of that court of equity, as they call it. Is this justice, Mr. Editor? Readers of this, is it right? Mr. Chalmers was sent out with the hope that he would administer justice for a short time. We say he has failed in this.

Have these essentials been fulfilled on the West Coast of Africa? We mean, of course, in the British possessions there. We wish we could believe that they have been and are. But this belief is scarcely possible in the face of the complaints that are continually reaching us; and we are compelled to confess that there are difficulties in the way of such fulfilment that seem to be at present almost insurmountable. We do not refer, of course, to Sierra Leone. The tribunals as there constituted, do, we believe, fulfil them. We do not hear any complaints from that place, which differs in many important respects from all others on the West Coast. Particular care is taken in the appointment of Judges and Magistrates there; there is a vigilant local Bar, and the population is at least large enough to prevent intimacies with Judges and Magistrates, poisoning the fount of justice. It was not always so. There was a time when we, were besieged with but too well founded complaints, and we had hard battles to fight for that purity which British reputation and British responsibility clearly demanded. But from the Gambia, Cape Coast, Accra, and even from Lagos, complaint follows complaint. And we feel bound to say the complaints seem to be but too well founded. Our readers will not fail to remember the exposé we made of the proceedings in the case ""Regina v. Davies,"" where everything that could possibly be done seemed to have been done to bring the administration of the law, even in the superior Courts, into well earned contempt. We did not then, nor do we now enter at all upon a consideration of the merits of that case; but the mode of procedure by which a conviction was sought to be obtained, and the revelation accidentally made of the punishment prearranged to be inflicted, the heavy sentence prearranged to be passed, produced on our mind an impression that will not be easily effaced. Since then we have made revelations through our columns of what we believe to have been the most gross and despotic injustice in the case of certain native refugee kings; while of meaner cases brought before the ordinary tribunals, but too many seem to be tainted by partiality, which is one of the worst forms of injustice. The evil seems to have a threefold origin: first, the appointment to judgeships and magistracies of unfit persons; secondly, the inadequacy of their salaries or remuneration; and thirdly, the narrowness of the localities and paucity of population where they live and perform their functions; so that the intimacies they form, and the hospitalities of which they too profusely avail themselves, give rise to suspicions—often but too well founded we fear—in the public mind. Because it should be borne in mind that the administration of so-called justice in the Native Courts was infamously gross and partial. Unless there were some other private considerations that surpassed money influence, the verdict was for him who could and would pay the most heavily. A disposition, a sort of foregone conclusion, therefore exists in the public mind that the decision of a Judge or Magistrate may be purchased. And when, as in some cases that we know of, the Judge or Magistrate is constantly accepting the hospitality (which means a great deal in Africa, where attractive native girls are too often placed at the temporary disposal of guests) of educated natives, not of the legal profession, of the loosest reputation and most abandoned and unprincipled character, who may have been allowed to practise as Counsel or Advocates as well as Solicitors, and the verdict or sentence or decision of the Magistrates is found to be almost habitually in favour of the person for whom they plead, it must be allowed that the uneducated people have some cause for misgivings, and for suspicion that the like influences which prevailed in Native Courts prevail also in the British West Coast ones. From the very outset of our editorial career in this journal, our constant effort has been directed to the formation of a public opinion in the chief towns of the British Settlements. We believe we were influential in producing this in Sierra Leone, where a local press has followed the lead. Lagos and Cape Coast have begun to labour in the same direction. But every succeeding mail brings to us a conviction that our services cannot yet be dispensed with, or we should have discontinued our labours, and the African Times would have ceased to exist. There is not any local public opinion sufficiently influential to justify us in withdrawing our hand from the plough at which we have so long laboured. It is not enough, however, that we should denounce evils that exist; we would fain suggest what would put an end to them. We do not see our way to this, as regards the inferior Courts, except through a purification of the superior ones; and as regards these, we must repeat anew our suggestion, which we again call upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to examine in all its bearings, that the Queen’s Advocate should not be allowed to practise in the Courts in other than Crown cases. We do not know that our strongly expressed opinions on this point, after the trial of ""Regina v. Davies,"" have had any influence in the proper quarter; but it does seem to us that every unprejudiced mind must admit that they have not been loosely formed, or that the change to which they point is unnecessary. Our readers will remember they were founded upon incontrovertible facts glaringly exhibited in the course of proceedings in the trial to which we have again especially alluded. Mr. Woodcock, then Queen’s Advocate, held a brief for the prosecuting merchants in England; he then, in the absence of a Judge of the Supreme Court in Lagos, sat as Judge, and as Judge gave certain decisions on the same cause; and when the case was remitted to the Supreme Court at Accra, he reappeared as Counsel for the prosecutors before a Judge with whom, during the hearing of the cause, he retired for an hour or two to take refreshment. Can any reasonable being doubt that this was calculated to raise a suspicion of partiality in the minds not only of the persons chiefly interested, but of the public in general? It did raise such, and, we say, justly. We are almost tired of repeating, as applicable in its fullest sense to Courts of Justice, what was said as regards Cæsar’s wife, that she must not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. And such, for the honour of the British name, we would have the British Courts in the West African Settlements to be. It was only an extreme case, such as that of ""Regina v. Davies,"" that showed the impropriety of the system that allowed Queen’s Advocates to practise as Counsel in private causes in its full enormity, although there was ample previous evidence to establish it. The frequent absences of Judges of the Supreme Court render it absolutely necessary that the Queen’s Advocate should from time to time occupy the judgment-seat, and no one but the Queen’s Advocate should be allowed on such occasions to occupy it; and thus occupying it, it is scarcely possible, while he continues to be allowed private practice, but that he will be called upon to hear causes in which he has previously advised, and perhaps been retained. Were the Supreme Court thus placed beyond the range of suspicion, suitors would have more confidence in appealing to it against what they might believe to be erroneous or unfair decisions of the inferior Courts; and the sentences of the latter being thus open to what might be regarded as impartial and enlightened revision, those who preside and are supposed to administer justice therein would be beneficially influenced. The change we thus strenuously advocate resolves itself into a mere money consideration to increase the salary of the Queen’s Advocate; that is, it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1882#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I hope I may live to see the day when the administration of justice shall be honoured, and not, as it now is, degraded in the eyes of the people; when the duties of the Collector of the Customs shall be considered to be compatible with aiding and assisting the honest merchant and trader, and not in attempting, in collusion with corrupt judges, to seek to entrap the unwary.

Nevertheless, this individual is so satisfied with the way in which he performs his duties that he is actually trying for an increase of salary, and possibly he may get it. But how can a man who is looking for an increase to his income, from some quarter or another, be independent?

If the person who holds the illustrious position of magistrate, or judge, or Government adviser at the Gambia do not consider himself paid well enough, let him seek promotion in some other colony, but seeking increase of salary in the Gambia, at the sacrifice of the independence he should at least pretend to maintain, is, to say the least of it, bad taste.—Yours obediently,\n\nA GAMBIA CREOLE.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""to reserve any point should he think fit for decision by the Judges in Banco at Sierra Leone on his return from Circuit; and a right of appeal from the decision of this Judge to the Court at Sierra Leone being preserved.

We hold the opinion—we may say conviction—that a system such as we have thus outlined, would be greatly superior and greatly more satisfactory in its results than the re-establishment of Supreme Courts with local resident Supreme Court Judges in all the Settlements as heretofore; because the Judge on Circuit would be free from all local bias, which a resident Judge in such very small civilized communities never could be, or, at least, never would be believed to be. For the information of such of our readers as may not be aware of the facilities of communication now existing between Sierra Leone and the other Settlements we may state that there are now five mail steamers per month, outward and homeward, from and to England, so that the other Settlements are now quite as readily accessible from Sierra Leone, as assize towns distant from London were to our Assize Judges a few years ago. Our limits will not allow us to do more at present than to implore an unbiassed consideration of the proposed changes at the Colonial-office."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Administration of Justice at Bathurst—Benefit of Criminal Juries', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A recent trial for murder at the Gambia has furnished strong evidence of the faulty administration of justice there, and of the value of trial by jury in criminal cases. A man, John Marsh, died after two or three days from injuries inflicted on him by a furious drunken man, George Bailey, when he was himself in a state of utter insensibility caused by drink, and all the other persons present were more or less intoxicated. We have the evidence before us, and the offence was clearly one of manslaughter, not murder. The Coroner for the settlement, Mr. Fowler, being absent in England on leave, Mr. Spilsbury, the Colonial Surgeon, had, by one of those abominable and most indefensible arrangements which we have before denounced, been appointed deputy or acting-coroner to officiate in his absence. We are happy, however, to see that Mr. Spilsbury had, in this instance, the good sense and feeling of propriety not to sit as coroner, and give evidence as surgeon before himself as coroner. Yet there was a Scylla as well as a Charybdis here, as well as in so many other human affairs. Though Mr. Spilsbury, the Colonial Surgeon, did not sit as coroner, Mr. Jackson, who had no appointment, whether as coroner or deputy-coroner, did. But who, it will be asked, is Mr. Jackson? We shall see in a moment. Mr. Jackson is Chief Magistrate at the Gambia. Mr. Jackson presided at a so-called coroner's inquest, and commits the man for trial on a charge of murder. He then has the man brought before him in his court as police magistrate, and as police magistrate he again commits him for murder; and when the time for holding sessions arrives, Mr. Jackson, sitting as chief magistrate, has arraigned before him for trial, on this same charge of murder, this same man, George Bailey, whom he has as sort of acting coroner and as police magistrate, already twice pronounced to be guilty of the murder. Surely it would be difficult to conceive any course of procedure in the administration of justice more monstrous than this! The counsel assigned to Bailey by the Court to conduct his defence objected to the coroner's inquisition being put in, as the man had been arraigned on the magistrate's committal only and had received copies of the depositions before the magistrate, but not any copy of depositions before a coroner. Mr. Jackson, as Chief Magistrate, overruled this objection, and the inquisition was also put in."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1871#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Administration of Justice on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In copying into our paper the contents of an appendix, if we may so call it, to a report by a shorthand writer of the trial, Regina v. Davies, before the Supreme Court at Accra, our purpose is not to cast ridicule upon the administration of justice according to British law, but to suggest, if possible, some remedy for the most glaring of its defects. It is not every day that occasion arises for the exhibition of these, such as was afforded by the case, Regina v. Davies. They may be said to have culminated in this case, in which a rich firm at Manchester relentlessly (we do not say unjustly, because we know little of the case except in its public aspects) pursued a debtor whom they had made bankrupt. It is not often that English merchants, however deeply they may have been, or may fancy that they have been, injured, care to throw away hundreds and thousands of pounds to gratify a feeling of revenge, or of an abstract love of justice, after having suffered loss by the operations of trade. In this case, however, the prosecutors, Messrs. Sykes, Mather and Co., of Manchester, influenced by one or other of the above-mentioned feelings, do not seem to have been deterred by any consideration, either as regards money or trouble, from bringing every available power of the law to bear against their bankrupt debtor. We have no fault to find with them on this ground; to their own conscience alone are they, like all other claimants, amenable as regards the means that they employ, while those means are within the limits, even the most extreme, recognizable and permitted by law. But the incidents in this case do justify us in condemning the way in which law and justice are administered in the British Courts of the Gold Coast Colony. In the progress of this case now under our consideration we find a law officer of the Crown acting alternately as Counsel for the prosecution, then as Judge in the same case, then again as prosecutor\'s Counsel. Can law and justice be thus justly administered, and so as to command the respect and confidence of the public? We have long felt, long before this case came to confirm our conviction, that this was impossible. We look in vain throughout such proceedings for the figure of justice, with a bandage over her eyes, holding in her hands the equally poised scales. Independently of the fact of the alternate position of prosecuting Counsel and Judge in the same individual during the several stages in the progress of the case, we see this Counsel and Judge, ultimately as again prosecuting Counsel, in close and habitual intercourse with the Judge who ultimately presides, even during the progress of the trial—during the time at which the Court adjourned for refreshment; and this intimacy and intercourse paraded before the eyes of the watching public. We do not say that this intimacy biased the Judge in his summing up to the jury, although that summing up was essentially a recapitulation of what had been urged by the prosecuting Counsel; but we must repeat what we have but too often had occasion to write with regard to West Coast matters, that as it was required of ""Caesar\'s wife"" that ""she should not only be pure, but above suspicion,"" so also that the administration of justice in the Queen\'s name in a British Court should be equally above suspicion. It was not so in the case, Regina v. Davies; it was, indeed, very far from being so. If ever there was a case in which the advocacy of competent Counsel should have been studiously allowed to the accused, this was one; and yet the prayer for an adjournment until such Counsel could arrive from Sierra Leone was harshly refused, and the accused was left, or rather condemned, to struggle alone against the prosecuting Judge-Counsel, pleading before a Court constituted as already described. We do not hesitate to say that this intensified the wrong, and gave just ground for the suspicions of the public mind. And this naturally brings us to the consideration of the partial remedy, the adoption of which we would earnestly press upon the immediate consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This remedy is, that the Queen\'s Advocate (the prosecuting Counsel in Regina v. Davies was the Queen\'s Advocate) shall in future depend solely and entirely upon the salary and emoluments attached to that office, and not be allowed to appear before the Court as Counsel in any other than purely criminal cases, as Crown Prosecutor. Owing to the constitution of the Courts of the West Coast of Africa, the Queen\'s Advocate, in the absence of the Judge—and such absences are frequent—becomes, and administers justice as, Judge (for the time being), relapsing again into the position of Queen\'s Advocate so soon as the real Judge reappears. A judgment seat thus constituted cannot command respect, while the Queen\'s Advocate is allowed to practise in the Court, and accept briefs in all cases. There is not only a growing intelligence among the people in the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa, which makes this proposed remedy indispensable if it be desired that those Courts should be respected, but there is now a constant accession of legal talent into those settlements, in the person of natives who have received legal education in England, many of them passing their examinations with great honour, and becoming barristers really ""learned in the law."" There will, consequently, be no lack of legal talent in the conduct of cases before the Courts, while a very unfair competition, in the person of the Queen\'s Advocate, will be removed. For although, as we have said, there is a general process of enlightenment going on in the West Coast Settlements, there is a prejudice, ignorant it may be, that by engaging the Queen\'s Advocate as their Counsel, they have an almost certainty of gaining their cause because of the intimacy of the Queen\'s Advocate with the Judge. Justice, as a consequence of that prejudice, has the aspect of being tainted at its source; and nothing can be more demoralizing than this. Nor is it only in the Courts of the Gold Coast Colony that a radical change is necessary. We have been constantly deluged, we may say, with complaints from the Gambia, where the public are entertained by very extraordinary scenes in Court, and where little or no confidence is felt that justice is truly and impartially administered. What was lately attempted in Lagos, but was abandoned because of the strong protest made against it, of a Magistrate or Judge whose decision was appealed against, sitting subsequently as Acting Supreme Court Judge to hear and determine appeals against judgments pronounced by himself in the lower Court, has not been at all unusual at the Gambia. There is frequently a great outcry against the verdict of juries in trials on the West Coast, but considering how the administration of justice has been too frequently travestied there, we think that even the purely native juries compare favourably with the other parties concerned. Such a state of things cannot be allowed much longer to continue; and we venture again to express the hope that the one change we have pleaded for—namely, the prohibition of a Queen\'s Advocate being allowed to practise generally in the Courts—will be forthwith decreed and enforced.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1881#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Judicial Establishments on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are authorized to state that the whole question of the Judicial Establishments on the West Coast of Africa is under consideration by Her Majesty's Government.

I will give you an evidence of this. Mr. X., our Chief Magistrate, acts the part of counsel in every case where his friend Mr. Y. is concerned. This Mr. Y. is the agent here of Mr. A. (of — in England), the trustee and receiver of the estate of A., B., and Co., and C. and Co. From the moment Mr. X. landed here, Mr. Y. (knowing he has many cases to come before Mr. X. in one of which he is aware he has little or no grounds in) took care to give board and lodging to Mr. X., and they have become so intimate that, although Mr. X. has since procured his own lodgings a long way off, he has several times heard cases in chambers at Mr. Y.'s house, and in those cases Mr. Y. was plaintiff. One or two cases have been thus handled, Mr. X. acting more as counsel than as judge; so that the parties concerned would have appealed to the Sierra Leone Court of Appeal, had not an insuperable difficulty been in the way, which frightens poor or prudent traders from incurring the risks which they would otherwise run. I will give you one instance. A Mr. D. gave Mr. E. a bill of exchange on A., B., and Co., in 1872, for 150l. The bill was returned dishonoured. Mr. E. sued Mr. D., and obtained judgment from the then Chief Magistrate, Mr. F. Mr. E. issued a writ to recover 150l. from Mr. D. Mr. D. having accounts with A., B., and Co., pending settlement with Mr. Y., and Mr. E. owing A., B., and Co. 101l., Mr. D., in open court, requested Mr. Y. to debit his account with the 101l., and he would give Mr. E. the balance—viz., 49l. Mr. Y. agreed to this before Judge F., and ordered his clerk to give Mr. E. a receipt for 101l., which the Sheriff considered as partly satisfying the judgment debt of 150l., and therefore recovered from Mr. D. and paid Mr. E. only 49l. and the costs. Now Mr. Y. and Mr. D., six months after, came to settlement of account, and it was alleged that Mr. D. had to pay Mr. Y. a large balance. Mr. Y. now objected to Mr. D.'s account to Mr. E. of 101l., and sued Mr. E. for it. Mr. Magistrate X. would not look at the receipt of Mr. Y.'s clerk, produced by Mr. E., nor listen to any representation from Mr. E., but accepted Mr. Y.'s denial of all knowledge of it as true, although Mr. Y.'s clerk and the Sheriff could have been examined if the Judge would only have listened; but being aware that Mr. E. is not in a position to overcome the great barrier in the way of the Court of Appeal, took advantage of it and did his own way for his friend. I give you this simple detail of facts as a small proof of the evils resulting from having local Judges; and it would be a great blessing to us all if we could have Circuit Judges: although where Europeans and Africans are concerned in court, there will not always, perhaps, even then, be that fair impartiality in allowing for the African's defects in English in representing his case, yet there will be by far a better decision, where a gentleman is appointed as Judge, and is not, in any sense, resident.—Yours truly, L.

These people have a strong antipathy to their former masters, with a considerable aptitude for military duties; 100 of them have accordingly been organized as an armed police, who not only share in all the duties of the garrison, but also perform many others which the custom of the service prevents soldiers from being employed upon, and which are absolutely required in a new settlement in the position of Lagos; for example, when summonses from the court have to be executed by the ordinary civil police in localities where resistance may be apprehended, or when prisoners have to be brought through similar places, or when it is necessary to send messengers through disturbed districts, these men are found capable of executing such services with great courage and fidelity; whilst, when not so employed, they perform all the duties of soldiers, mounting guard over stores, magazines, buildings, &c., and are ready to turn out at once, on the order of the Governor, for the suppression of any disturbance or commotion.\n\nIt has been already stated that, in the contemplated reduction of the force on the West Coast of Africa, the two companies of black troops who form the garrison of Lagos are intended to be withdrawn; there being no proper barracks for officers or men, they have suffered considerably in their health, and as the cost for providing the necessary accommodation for them is estimated at 20,000l., it is considered better, as it will be more economical, to remove them at once, and to entrust the entire protection of the settlements to the Houssas, whose numbers will be somewhat augmented for the purpose.\n\nThere is as yet no Government ecclesiastical establishment, but the Church Missionary Society maintains three churches in Lagos and one in Badagry; the Wesleyans also support a church in Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCUMULATION OF OFFICES IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We hope it will not have seemed invidious that we should in our last number have instanced Mr. Barry as illustrating the evils of the system of Government in our West African colonies and settlements. It is true that at the Sherboro the colonial surgeon has three other appointments also; that another official has two, both with handsome salaries attached, &c., &c. But it is at the Gold Coast that these evils have become most prominent, and have been most compromising, as regards the British official character and the purity of administration; and the loading with incompatible offices a gentleman who, however talented and estimable he may be, was quite new to official life, necessarily challenged remark from us, as the only public organ that represents Africa with the British public, and Great Britain with the Africans.\n\nThat the offices thus accumulated could not be properly held by one and the same individual at any one time, will very clearly appear when we state that the holder of one of them cannot, while charged with its duties, sit in the Council, while the holder of another of them becomes, in virtue of the office, a prominent and influential member of that Council. While charged, therefore, with the offices we have enumerated, Mr. Barry is at the same time expressly enjoined to attend the Council, and expressly prohibited from doing so. And this is not all. There is something which in our eyes is far more serious. In the administration of justice it is of the very highest importance that there should be not only an absence of all bias on the part of the judge, but also an absence of everything that could afford even the slightest ground for an imputation of partiality or predecision. The judge should not only be pure, but beyond suspicion. What, then, can be urged in favour or excuse of an arrangement by which an individual is, in his capacity of Queen’s advocate, the public and official prosecutor, and sits also as judge, in his capacity as acting chief justice, for the trial of the very causes he has, as Queen’s advocate, promoted and undertaken to substantiate? Surely this is a most flagrant impropriety; and we cannot be surprised that observers should challenge the purity and impartiality of justice thus administered or maladministered. But as if this was insufficient, that very time was chosen for promulgating new orders and regulations as regards pleading in the courts at Cape Coast were at the same time promulgated and enforced. Previously, any person might appear as advocate or counsel for a prisoner—any one might conduct or defend a suit in the court. But all this was changed.
