1085,"The Dutch colonial administration in Africa suffered from inefficiencies and neglect of essential duties due to understaffing and resource constraints, leading to officials being overburdened with multiple roles.","The examination of the Dutch colonial administration in Africa through the lens of the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles presents a nuanced understanding of the claim regarding inefficiencies and neglect due to understaffing and resource constraints. The ""General History of Africa"" does not specifically address the Dutch colonial administration, focusing instead on British, French, Belgian, Italian, and Portuguese systems, and highlighting issues such as indirect rule and economic exploitation. This absence of specific references to the Dutch administration means the textbook neither supports nor refutes the claim directly. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts that support the claim, describing how officials were overburdened with multiple roles, such as one officer simultaneously serving as Acting Colonial Secretary, Acting Chief Justice, and Public Prosecutor, while receiving minimal pay. This overburdening aligns with the claim of understaffing and resource constraints leading to inefficiencies. The articles also mention the neglect of essential duties, such as poor sanitation and infrastructure, and ineffective responses to public grievances, consistent with the claim of neglect. However, while the articles highlight the consequences of resource constraints, they do not explicitly mention these constraints, focusing instead on the resulting administrative challenges. Together, these sources provide a complex picture, with The African Times offering direct support for the claim, while the ""General History of Africa"" remains silent on the specific issues within the Dutch colonial administration.","The provided excerpts from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not specifically address the Dutch colonial administration in Africa, nor do they provide direct evidence of inefficiencies and neglect due to understaffing and resource constraints within the Dutch colonial system. The text primarily discusses British, French, Belgian, Italian, and Portuguese colonial administrations, highlighting issues such as indirect rule, the manipulation of traditional leadership, forced labor, and the economic exploitation of African resources. While these themes could be relevant to a broader discussion of colonial inefficiencies and resource constraints, the absence of specific references to the Dutch colonial administration represents a notable difference from the claim. Therefore, the text does not provide any direct support or refutation of the claim regarding the Dutch colonial administration's inefficiencies and neglect due to understaffing and resource constraints.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the inefficiencies and neglect within the Dutch colonial administration in Africa due to understaffing and resource constraints. The articles highlight the accumulation of multiple roles by single officials, such as one officer being Acting Colonial Secretary, Acting Chief Justice, Public Prosecutor, and more, while receiving minimal pay. This overburdening of officials with numerous incongruous offices aligns with the claim of understaffing and resource constraints leading to inefficiencies. Additionally, the articles mention the allowance of military ranks to compensate for low pay, further indicating a lack of adequate resources and staffing. The articles also describe the neglect of essential duties, such as the poor state of sanitation and infrastructure, and the failure to address public grievances effectively, which are consistent with the claim of neglect due to administrative inefficiencies. However, the articles do not specifically mention the Dutch administration's resource constraints, focusing more on the consequences of such constraints, like overburdened officials and neglected duties. This absence of explicit mention of resource constraints is a notable difference from the claim. Overall, the articles provide a detailed account of the administrative challenges faced by the Dutch colonial administration, supporting the claim of inefficiencies and neglect due to understaffing and resource constraints.",True,1085,Colonial Administration,Critique of Dutch Colonial Administration,"[{'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere. It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Side by side with European encroachments, Liberia faced serious internal economic and social problems.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921. These protracted wars on different fronts and the cost and inefficiency of the 'native administration' encouraged foreign intervention and strained the government's human and material resources. 66 The government's revenues were never adequate. Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade. Coffee, Liberia's major export commodity since the 1860s, was produced mostly by Americo-Liberian planters and entrepreneurs using both Recaptive and indigenous African labour.

The general reactions of the colonial regimes in seeking to tighten control by the use of physical force and the imposition of legal disabilities were understandable in view of the fact that the period witnessed the expansion of autocracies and illiberal tendencies in Europe itself. But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony and Natal before 1870', 'content': 'During the period before 1870, the Natal whites also made some con› stitutional progress. Within a few years of its annexation, many Boers returned to the highveld across the Drakensberg Mountains, in protest against British failure to recognize their land claims, the British African policy, and the new political arrangements, which excluded them com› pletely from any participation. At the same time, Natal had a large African population, many of them returnees from exile whence they had been driven during the Mfecane.\nThe initial difficulties facing the weak colonial administration in Natal concerned the government of the Africans. The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected. As a result, African education remained largely, if not exclusively, the responsibility of the ill-financed and . ill-equipped missionaries, while the administration was done by Shepstone.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Moreover, nowhere and at no level did the facilities provided meet the demand nor were they evenly distributed. As even Lloyd admits, as late as the mid-i930S, 'government expenditure everywhere remained low, amounting in the mid-i930S to only 4% of total revenue in Nigeria and the French territories, and 7% in Ghana'.$^{36}$ Nor were these schools and institutions properly distributed in each colony. Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town. In the Gold Coast for example about 80% of the secondary schools were found in Cape Coast. In Uganda, by 1920, there were 328 elementary schools in Buganda and only 34, 24 and practically none in the Western, Eastern and Northern provinces respectively.$^{37}$ Facilities for education were so inadequate and so unevenly distributed, because the colonial powers did not aim at pro› moting education for its own sake or for the sake of the Africans, but rather, to quote one African scholar, 'to produce Africans who would be more productive for the [colonial] system'. 38 Besides its grossly inadequate nature numerically and its uneven dis› tribution, the curricula provided by all these institutions were determined by the colonial rulers and were closely modelled on, if not carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan countries and therefore irrelevant to the needs of the continent. No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically. Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation.

And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks.

In the meantime tropical Africa and South America met the demand from wild rubber, found in Africa mostly in vines and also needing great quantities of labour for its collection and initial processing.."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

This same wilful neglect was noticed again on the arrival of the Roquelle here, last Saturday evening, at about four o'clock, the post-office having on this occasion peremptorily refused to receive a single letter, although that steamer did not leave here till eleven o'clock next day.

Although rates are regularly levied for the purpose of repairing drains and making other local improvements in Bathurst, and the attention of the Administration has been repeatedly directed to this subject, yet the sanitation of the town is in a most neglected condition, and Half Die and Newtown, the most unhealthy localities, left to take care of themselves. In the rainy season, the town is generally inundated from want of responsible persons to take care of the Sluice Gates, causing great loss and damage to property.

An Ordinance to repeal the Trade License Ordinance, 1893, and to make other provisions in lieu thereof, was passed at the Legislative Council held on the 18th ult. The provisions of the Ordinance in question are one-sided, and, above all, unconstitutional. The Colony is dependent for its prosperity on the trade carried on in the Rivers. Local taxes as such cannot bring a Revenue, and when the Administration under the pretext of protecting the large mercantile houses, which are well able to take care of themselves, from being defrauded by their traders, restricts liberty of commerce in the rivers and renders it possible for licenses to be arbitrarily refused to applicants for the same, it deals a fatal blow to the prosperity of the Colony whose resources, as it is well known, are very limited. Section 4 of the Ordinance reads as follows:—\n\n""That it shall be lawful for the Colonial Treasurer or any such Commissioner to refuse to issue a license to any applicant, unless such applicant shall first produce a certificate signed by a member of either the Executive or Legislative Council and by two Justices of the Peace that he is of good character and a fit and proper person to be entrusted with such license.""\n\nThe chief objection to this section is that it is unconstitutional, and interferes arbitrarily with the liberties of a British subject. It also opens a wide field for abuse, and practically places the liberties of the entire trading community in the hands of three unofficial members of the Executive or Legislative Council who are themselves merchants. All men are human, business men not excepted; and would it not be a source of temptation for men wielding such a power to place obstacles in the way of their fellow competitors, the other mercantile firms and small business houses? The section providing for the revocation of licenses is also impolitic. It follows that all traders who cannot obtain a license, or whose licenses may be revoked, will be obliged to flock at Bathurst to become a source of danger to the community, as all unemployed necessarily are under the pressure of want and distress.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character.

Far from this. No one can be more convinced than we are of an honest and enlightened attention to their duties on the part of the permanent staff of the Colonial Office, upon whom the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the time being, must always depend for information to guide and assist him in determining matters brought under his consideration and awaiting his decision. The fault, when fault there is, is not chargeable to individuals, but to the system; and not so much even to the system itself as to the want in it of a power of expansion adequate to the pressure upon it. When we fix our thoughts upon the vast colonial possessions of Great Britain, and upon the mass of important questions relative thereto that must necessarily be referred to the Colonial Office, our only wonder is, not that, as in the case of the West African Crown colonies and settlements, there is often fatal neglect, practical and gross injustice, and a paralyzing apathy, but that the Colonial Office should be at all able to deal satisfactorily with so many, so varied, and such vital interests as are continually pressing upon it for consideration and authoritative decision. That abuses should spring up, and be allowed to grow and ripen in small Crown colonies, where the voice of public opinion, in the absence of a concentrating and repeating medium, is so small and faint that it can scarcely make itself heard at all in opposition to the loud, stentorian, and decisive utterances of a proud and self-sufficient officialism, cannot be a matter of surprise to thinking men, or justify a sweeping condemnation of the supreme authority that could, and no doubt would under more favourable circumstances, have suppressed and annihilated them. The sun never sets on the dominions, more or less, under the supreme control of the Colonial Office of Great Britain; and it is only natural that among those colonies, as in ordinary human life, the old proverb should be realized that ""the weakest goes to the wall."" What remains for these weak ones, being hard-pressed against the wall, is that they should cry aloud, and get their cry lustily and continuously prolonged and repeated, and thus enforce attention to their situation and their wants. We have shown how and why it is that the progress of such colonies has hitherto been, more or less, a matter of indifference to the mother country, exulting in the exuberance of its wealth, and the seeming invulnerability of its manufacturing monopolies; and that thus it was the development of the resources of those colonies on the West Coast of Africa, tempting and magnificent as they are, have not received even the smallest share of that attention which their importance demands, and would have received from the administrative authorities of a less opulent and, consequently, more necessitous European Power. In this absence of any felt necessity on the part of the British Government, what was and is wanting must manifestly be this—that some one should make it a special duty to bring frequently before Her Majesty\'s Government the fact of the existence of such resources; strenuously...\n_March 1, 1879_', 'last_edit_date': '1879-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1879#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A great drawback to the commercial prosperity of the West Coast stations is the fact that there is no real working class. Men who are educated consider themselves too good for labour as agriculturists, and only a very few condescend to become carpenters or blacksmiths. To be a clerk or a trader is the one idea of the native who can read and write and has some knowledge of the first three rules of arithmetic. Those who remain Pagan, or rather who do not frequent the schools and chapels, and live according to old habits, have few wants, and those easily supplied. Six weeks' work in the year will supply corn ample for all their wants, whilst capaiva, bananas, and such like, once a plantation is established, continue to produce for years, and oil and peppers may be had for the trouble of collecting them. Tobacco grows in the country, but the people are usually too idle to cultivate it, and it constitutes the main portion of what they buy from the traders. The cloth to cover their nakedness, and beads, powder, guns, wire, &c., they can buy with a lucky find of gold, or by gathering the fruit of the oil palm to make oil, and bartering it. As a native can live luxuriously on 3d. a day, even if he has no plantation and no wife to cook for him, and for another 3d. he can get drink and tobacco, whilst his housing costs him nothing, and 1s. or 1s. 3d. a day is his usual wages, a man who works for a month or two months in the year can afford to be idle for the remainder. The Gold Coast could be one of the greatest of producing countries if only there were some people in its boundaries who would work. There is scarcely a yard of garden except what is called for by the actual necessities of the people, and plantations for the purpose of export do not exist. As one gets more among the natives who are free from the influences of the coast one looks for some improvement, but except that slavery still exists, and that therefore some people are forced to show a certain amount of industry, there is none to be found. To this lack of industry must be added another great blot on the condition of the country; that is the apathy of the Government with regard to public works, and specially with regard to the improvement of communications. The revenues are hoarded in the colonial chest, and necessary repairs to public buildings are begrudged, whilst any expenditure on improvements is unknown. The roads or tracks are under the supervision of the district commissioners, usually officers of the Houssa constabulary, and are made and cleared in a spasmodic manner by a species of forced labour, in which the greater portion of the work is done by those who receive least benefit. The improvement and construction of landing places, and the construction of a tramway for the transport of oil to a good place of shipment, have been spoken of for years, but the powers that be consider it is more advisable to have a good balance in the treasury than to spend a sixpence on the most needed improvements; and as for the Colonial Office, the general feeling there is that our African possessions are a nuisance, and that if we could get rid of them it would be a good job. This does not apply to the heads of departments or the political chiefs of the Office, though doubtless at times they share in the weariness of their subordinates, but to the rank and file of the Office, who only know of British West Africa by its causing them an extra amount of correspondence."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dutch and English Exchange of Possessions on the Gold Coast—Uniform Import Duties', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Among other excuses for misgovernment or inefficient government in the Protected Territories, and the absence of all administrative efforts for aiding in their material development, paucity of resources was ever foremost. ""What can be done with countries where only a very paltry revenue can be raised, and for which England is not disposed to make pecuniary sacrifices?"" has long been a general answer to all remonstrances. That ""paucity of revenue"" was no doubt a great obstacle in the way of improvements. Nor did the removal of the obstacle depend solely upon the British Government. The Dutch and British possessions were mixed up together on the Gold Coast; the Dutch would not make any arrangement with the English for levying uniform duties, and, indeed, declined levying any duties at all. There was consequently an arbitrary limit to the amount of duties which the British could impose. Increased beyond a certain amount, all trade must have gone to the free Dutch ports, and no revenue whatever would have been obtained. There were other evils involved in the Dutch occupation, which moved us to make strenuous efforts for effecting the purchase of the Dutch settlements by the British Government. Those exertions have failed because of the real or alleged incompetency of the Dutch Government to alienate any Dutch territory, except for a territorial equivalent. We regret this, and deeply, too, not because we are desirous of territorial aggrandisement for Great Britain, but because, notwithstanding our great failure of duty hitherto, we do believe the future Christian civilization and material prosperity of those countries to depend upon the continued presence of the British flag on the Gold Coast. It being impossible to obtain the Dutch possessions by purchase, even if the British Government could be brought to make the investment, the only alternative, if any good was to be hoped for, was an exchange and consolidation of Coast possessions by the Dutch and English Governments, coupled with an undertaking for a uniform rate of import duties. Negotiations with this object have been for some time in progress, and rumour has anticipated the fact of their favourable termination. But we believe we are correct in stating, that if not actually concluded in the manner that we and our friends on the Coast desire, they are at least so far advanced toward that point as to allow of our treating the exchange, &c., as un fait accompli. We have before us a Dutch Government map showing the proposed exchange. A line is drawn into the interior from Elmina. All to westward of this bears the Dutch colour, all to eastward the British. When the exchange is effected, Dix Cove, Apollonia, and Commendah will become Dutch possessions, while Cormantine, Apam, Mouree, Barracoe, and Dutch Accra will in future belong to Great Britain. As the line is drawn from the Coast to the Praah, and shows the whole of Wassaw, &c., under Dutch tint, we presume that Great Britain will have acquiesced in that renunciation of her protectorate made some time since by the Wassaws, and will not again receive them under it. This will not, of course, make the Wassaws Dutch, any more than it will make the Fantees, Assins, &c., English, but it will most likely be understood as preventing any interference by Great Britain in future with the native laws and administration, &c., in Wassaw, so long as Wassaw remains at peace with the countries of the British Protectorate.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

It is on this distinction between men and things that all justice, human and divine, is founded."" That this dictum, laid down by high authority, has been from generation to generation violated in Africa and with the Africans by so-called European Christians is patent to every one. Africa is designated, and with but too much truth, as pre-eminently the land of darkness. But dark as Africa is, even the deepest darkness of her superstitious and barbarian night is not so dark as are the pages of that volume in the history of Christendom which chronicles the dealings of European nations, among whose people the blessed precepts of the divine Gospel of peace and love had been promulgated and, nominally at least, received for more than ten centuries, with those stigmatised heathen, who, in the great day of final retribution, may as justly rise up in judgment against our forefathers as may Sodom and Gomorrah against the wilful rejection of the incarnate Son of God. For after all those long centuries of greater or less acquaintance with the doctrine of universal love which Christianity proclaims, they swooped down upon Africa like foul birds of prey, or demons let loose from hell. It is a dreadful volume, and we daily pronounce the condemnation of those whose deeds are there recorded, when in our unreasonable and uncharitable impatience to obtain immediate Christian results for every paltry pound, or even shilling, that we spend in God\'s service among the heathen we denounce as conclusive evidence of his non-conversion every delinquency, every backsliding of the poor African, who, only a few years ago first heard of Christ and His great salvation, and nominally, and we believe in very many cases really, embraced that glorious hope of everlasting life and joy. We cannot see the beam in our own eye—only the mote in our poor brother\'s eye. And although as a national crime with regard to Africa, ours is a thing of the past, the necessity for the continued presence of our slave-repression squadron off the coast of Africa proves, alas! but too well that Christendom has not yet cleared itself from the foul guilt in which it so long revelled at the cost of the blood and tears of Africa. But it is not alone the remnant of the foreign slave-trade which proves that the old leaven which made men look upon Africans as a prey to be devoured, and not as wounded neighbours they were bound to succour, still exists in the European mind. The way in which we nationally grumble of late at the cost of the paltry little bottles of oil and wine that we are supposed to have been pouring into their wounds also proves it. And the Dutch settlements on the Gold Coast afford strong evidence of it. We hope that, after four years\' publication of this journal, our readers know us too well to have supposed that we were giving insertion to the letters which have appeared in it on the subject of ""Dutch African Government"" merely because they were more or less well written, and amusing in some of the incidents related in them. We feel very strongly the necessity of a radical change in the system, the ends, and aims, and objects of Dutch government on the Gold Coast. The ends, aims, and objects are low and vile, and the system and its administrators (as a general rule, to which, however, there are of course exceptions) are not less so. A little trade, a little gold dust, three or four hundred slaves every year for service in Java, under the name of enlisted free soldiers, and the reputation of still having possessions in Africa—are the ends, aims, and objects in view in retaining and keeping up the name of rule and government in those countries. Men—Africans—are still there considered as things, as mere means to an end. Nothing is done to spread civilization and Christianity among them. There is little or no education bestowed—little or no Christian teaching offered. We have freed ourselves, we believe, from Juggernaut in India, but the Dutch patronise, and countenance, and subsidise the wretched and degrading Fetish superstition, whose high priests are murderers, and whose rites are debauchery and every vice. We have felt it our duty to this country, to Africa, and even to the Dutch Government itself, to use the means at our command for exposing this. There are high and honourable men taking part in the Dutch government at the Hague. There are, doubtless, a goodly number of really Christian men in the Dutch Chambers, in whose eyes all this ought to be and must be considered abominable and dishonouring. We indulge the belief that all that is needed to bring about a change is to show these eminent individuals precisely what the thing is with which they are connected, and which they uphold on the African coast, at the cost of something like 11,000l. sterling per annum. Surely it is not worth while to pay money for such disgraceful results? And our exposure of so evil a course has nothing in it that ought to be deemed offensive, or to wound the national pride of the people of the Netherlands. We have proved ourselves to be impartial censors. We do not conceal British errors, British delinquencies and shortcomings in Africa. We do not assume a national pharisaical attitude and position, and point to our national Dutch neighbour as ""that publican."" We have but too much cause even yet to smite upon our own breasts, and confess our unworthiness. But at the same time justice demands that we should say, the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, with such a system, and such men as for the most part administer it, are a great obstacle in the way of British effort to ameliorate the condition of the people of those countries, and bring them within the pale of Christian civilization, with its attendant industrial results. It is bad enough to have to deal with the deep-rooted native vices, and errors, and industrial inertia, without having a focus of aggravated demoralization in neighbouring European settlements to contend with and against also. It is bad enough for us to be occasionally betrayed by our own officials falling under the influence of native vices, instead of setting the example of ennobling Christian virtues, without having in neighbouring settlements what looks at least like an organised system of deliberate continuous evil, under which the very worst practices are personally shared in, and fostered, and encouraged by the chief European authorities. We do not believe that the Dutch Government at the Hague can have been cognisant of what has taken place and what has been done and practised in its name and under its authority at Elmina and elsewhere on the Gold Coast; and in exposing it, so that it may be brought inoffensively beneath their notice, we are not only rendering a service to Africa, but doing as we would have men do to us were we in a position that made us, as they are, morally responsible for acts which bring so much dishonour on the European name. We are not surprised that the local authorities in the Dutch settlements should especially abominate and determine to get rid of Africans who have received education at Sierra Leone or other British settlements. This is only an additional evidence of the influence for good that Sierra Leone and other colonies and settlements where missionaries are bestowing the great civilising boon and agent, education, are exerting on the West Coast of Africa. But we shall feel surprised if the home Netherland authorities, who after all are the real ones, show that they are equally opposed to African advancement.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > Labour > The labour system and legislation"", 'content': ""In French Africa, the administration controlled recruitment which in theory, after 1921 in AEF, could not exceed 'one-third of the able-bodied male population having reached adult age'.

The limit was reduced to 10% in the middle of the decade because of the drying-up of the labour pool; but in general the official quota was very considerably exceeded.$^{20}$ In the Portuguese colonies, a subtle distinction was established between 'penal labour' reserved for convicts, and the labour - 'a moral and social obligation' - of men between 14 and 60 years of age, for at least six months per year.$^{21}$ The state was 'to have no scruples about obliging and if necessary forcing the Negro savages of Africa to work, that is, to improve themselves through labour in order to improve their means of existence, to civilize themselves'. 22 The plague of recruiters was particularly prevalent in the Congo, where the state delegated its powers of recruiting to companies such as the Bourse du Travail du Katanga (BTK) a private agency recruiting for the mines in the rural zones. In 1926, to ease the labour shortage, the government awarded to the Union MiniŁre du Haut Katanga (UMHK) the recruiting monopoly in Maniema (Eastern Province) and in Ruanda-Urundi. 23 Finally, in the Portuguese colonies, scandals broke out periodically, such as the scandal of forced and slave labour on the cocoa plantations of Sào TomØ and Principe at the turn of the twentieth century.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example. This gave a discernible ambiguous quality to the writings of many articulate Africans in the early period of colonial affirmation.

This is reported to the Governor, who immediately orders him—verbally, of course, as usual—to receive thirty-six lashes (*vide* Dr. Jeans, the Colonial Surgeon\'s, evidence). The Colonial Surgeon says, ""At the end of twelve lashes I stopped the flogging."" We are sorry to be obliged to say he ought not to have allowed him to be flogged at all. But to return to Gordon\'s case. Dr. Waters says: ""The natives have but little power of resisting disease, sinking very rapidly. They are especially prone to inflammation of the lungs, which is very fatal with them; the most common cause of inflammation of the lungs is cold; violent exercise will make a man more subject to the influence of cold; poor diet and fatigue would be predisposing causes toward this disease. I think the prison diet, as described by Mr. Campbell, is insufficient; that a man who has been sixteen hours and a-half without food is not fit to be put on shot-drill; a man in such a state would become more exhausted, and the exercise would tell more generally upon him; it is a dangerous practice for a man to sit down in the open yard, coming hot from drill, without covering or shelter. In January the temperature has been recorded as low as 54 deg., and as high as 90 deg. As I did not see Gordon, I could not undertake to say that the shot-drill, along with the insufficient clothing, might not have been the exciting cause of his decease. I believe it was excited by cold. *I should consider it a most dangerous practice to set convicts to hard labour without previous medical examination to ascertain their fitness—lives might often be sacrificed that way.*"" Dr. Jeans, the Colonial Surgeon, says: ""I was not furnished with any written rules for my guidance as gaol surgeon. The only instructions I received was at the Colonial-office, where I was told it was my duty to visit the infirmary once a-day, and to attend the sick therein. *I have never been asked to examine prisoners with a view to ascertain if they were physically fit for shot-drill or treadmill.* I have considered the labour to which the prisoners are subjected as excessive in comparison with diet."" We need not quote further. We can understand pretty clearly what Dr. Waters meant when he wrote that Gordon did not die *directly* from shot-drill and treadmill. He did not fall down dead at these exciting exercises (exciting to Admiral Patey we mean), but only died of results consequent upon them. All the evidence—medical, of jailors, and of prisoners—tends to establish this. Are we not right, then, in saying that prisoners are being systematically murdered in Bathurst Gaol? It is no answer, no palliation, to say that the fatal result was not in Gordon\'s case, and could not be in any other similar case, a calculated or desired one, but only accidental through the omission of certain preliminary precautions—better clothing, better diet, and more watchful supervision. We say this is no sufficient answer—does not furnish the shadow of an excuse. Men who are officially dealing with human lives are morally, if not legally, guilty of the loss of such lives, if such loss proceeds from stupidity or neglect on their part. It is possible that Governor Wall did not intend really to murder the man whom he caused to be flogged to death at Goree, even as Admiral Patey did not intend, no doubt, really to murder Day—who might, however, have died, being weak after a dangerous illness, if the Colonial Surgeon had not stopped the ""cat"" at the twelfth stroke. Governor Wall possibly believed that he was acting within the limits prescribed by law, or of his powers, by virtue of the authority vested in him by his command—but he did murder his victim nevertheless, and was most righteously executed for it. If we are to believe Admiral Patey, however, he has somebody still more exalted than himself to fall back upon, though we do not think that would save him in a righteous trial. Dr. Jeans, the Colonial Surgeon, and another witness also, state that Admiral Patey said *he had received a letter from the Duke of Buckingham insisting on the shot-drill and treadmill being carried out in Bathurst Gaol.* The responsibility for what has occurred rests therefore, not only on Admiral Patey alone, but on the Duke of Buckingham also. We do not say that the question is which of the two, or whether both, should be hanged like Governor Wall—but we do say that we are entitled to demand that such atrocities should not go altogether unpunished. There is no doubt on our mind, and we think there can be no doubt on the mind of any disinterested person who reads all the evidence, which we print in this present number, that Gordon died, either a victim to Admiral Patey\'s fondness for the application of heavy shot-drill and treadmill to all hard-labour prisoners indiscriminately, without previous medical examination—without regard to their fitness or unfitness—without taking any, even the most ordinary, precautions to prevent their proving fatal; or he died a victim to the superior and inflexible orders of the Duke of Buckingham, which, as a ready and willing tool of a ducal Secretary of State, Admiral Patey was determined to carry out with Draconian severity and Procrustean indiscrimination. It is creditable to the other officials at the Gambia that they did not combine, as is usual on the West Coast, to whitewash the head of the Executive. If this honourable course were more generally pursued there would soon be an end of that virtual irresponsibility which now unhappily exists, and which emboldens administrators and others to gratify their caprices, their passions, and not unfrequently their vices, to the great injury and disgrace of the public service, the spread of demoralisation, and the peril of property and of human life.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Murder by Shot-Drill Again', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following circumstance has created a painful feeling in Cape Coast: A convict prisoner recently absconded from gaol and was recaptured.

The evidence we now print is, to our mind, conclusive on this point. We were slow to believe it. When we first heard of the death of Joseph Gordon, and the verdict of the coroner\'s jury, we thought there must be some mistake. We were not disposed to imagine that an unfortunate petty criminal—a man sentenced to a few months\' imprisonment with hard labour—could have so aroused the evil passions of authorities or gaolers as to induce them to inflict on him an unwonted and fatal degree of punishment. And in this we were right, although wrong in our doubt as to the man having been murdered. Gordon was not in any way exceptionally treated. He was only one of many, all of whom were subject to the same system—a system so barbarous and atrocious that a better could scarcely have been devised if the killing off a percentage of the gaol population had been a deliberately contemplated result. Look at the evidence! The coroner\'s jury had returned a verdict that the man was killed by shot-drill and treadmill punishment. The Administrator of the colony, it appears, appoints and regulates the criminal employment. This was supposed to be appointed and regulated by Ordinance, the colony having a sort of legislative council. Admiral Patey, however, seems to have acted without Ordinance as regards shot-drill. He therefore rightly viewed the finding of the jury as involving something of a criminal charge against himself. He is consequently dissatisfied with it. He knows the power of quasi-omnipotent and irresponsible West African governors to elicit from subordinate officials and others in those colonies just such opinions as they themselves desire to have expressed, when the said governors refer matters to them. He therefore ordered Gordon\'s body to be exhumed and a post-mortem examination to be made. The surgeon found the right lung, liver, and spleen to be most extensively diseased, but believed the immediate cause of death to be inflammation of the lungs (vide No. 2). If the Administrator had possessed a particle of wisdom he would have stopped here. But the verdict of the jury had condemned his favourite shot-drill and treadmill exercise, and he would not stop there. He demands Dr. Waters\', the examining surgeon\'s, opinion as to whether the death was caused by those punishments, &c. It will be seen presently that in presenting the circumstances, he grossly misstated them in his own favour. Dr. Waters replies (No. 9) that ""in his opinion such hard labour would not directly produce inflammation of the lungs."" The Administrator refers to Dr. Burrows, the Chief Military Medical Officer, who makes a similar reply. The Chief Magistrate is then ""requested to give his opinion as to the legal effect of the verdict, and whether it was not the duty of the Coroner to direct the jury to find a specific verdict against some person,"" &c.

Mr. Chalmers, the Magistrate, says (No. 8) that ""it is impossible to extract from the evidence such a verdict, no witness having stated the circumstances or the authority under which Gordon was subjected to the treadmill and shot-drill; an omission,"" he adds, ""the more remarkable that there is, apparently, an inconsistency in the infliction of these punishments upon a man selected for the responsible duty of hospital attendant."" This must have been ""touching the raw;"" but the Administrator is determined to go on tightening the rope, figuratively speaking, about his own neck. An additional inquiry is ordered. There is no power to take this evidence on oath, so it is taken on declaration, under the Act 5 and 6 William IV. To realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. There are rules and regulations by Ordinance, but the Governor gives verbal orders to go beyond them, and the gaoler obeys. Hard labour was previously understood to be ""that the prisoners worked in gangs, in chains, in public or other works."" The present Administrator made an addition to this. He ordered that in addition they should have half an hour shot-drill in the morning, and half an hour treadmill in the evening. (Admiral Patey had stated it as ten minutes each to Dr. Waters.) While the Admiral was absent in England four months, the gaoler had discontinued these punishments; but when he heard he was coming back he falsified his journal to conceal his humanity. Admiral Patey calls him to account for it. He replied that he omitted them because the men have such heavy work on the sea-wall and drains. He then receives orders to resume the shot-drill and treadmill, and this is the routine: The men rise at half-past five, begin work at six (without food); are brought back to gaol at half-past nine, shot-drill till ten, then breakfast (their first food for the day), which consists of one pound of rice, boiled plain, with salt; then to work again till half-past four, treadmill till five, then dinner (their only other meal), consisting of half a pound of bread and half a pound of beef, including bone; then locked into cells at six. Thus, when placed on shot-drill, the men have been sixteen and a half hours without food, and on work three and a half hours of that time. No wonder that ""prisoners complain of their chests"" after their 24-pounder shot-drill; no wonder ""they fall down sweating"" at the treadmill. We repeat that to realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. We are not squeamish about making prisoners work, but this evidence causes us an indescribable feeling of disgust and horror. We have given an account of the diet of these hard-labour prisoners to whose tasks daily shot-drill and treadmill were added by Admiral Patey—imposed by verbal order, without their having been prescribed by any Ordinance, ordered to be performed at hours when the men were exhausted by labour and long fasting. But that which constitutes the gravamen of the charge against Admiral Patey, is that he imposed and ordered, and inexorably exacted, these additional and trying labours without any previous medical examination of the men to know whether they were able to perform them without danger to their lives. Can anything be more atrocious than this? Are the lives of men, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment because they cannot pay a fine imposed (see the Gordon evidence) to be thus trifled with by some insane Administrator?—for the most charitable presumption is that such a man must be insane. The medical evidence asserts that ""three-fourths of the natives who come under medical examination are ruptured"" (see No. 17); and yet this probably ruptured man, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment as an alternative of a fine, is put on the treadmill and shot-drill! To be sure these men are only Africans, and the Administrator is an Englishman and a Rear-Admiral; yet, though they are so mean and he so exalted, we should scarcely have ventured to think that when the gaoler told him ""the shot-drill was too severe for the men, and that sometimes they fell off,"" he could have had the criminal inhumanity to reply, ""If any man falls off, you must keep him his time at it.""

The evils chiefly complained of are said to arise principally through the unfitness of the gaoler for the post he occupies. It is stated that the prisoners—both debtor and criminal (and all seem to us, by the account given, to be huddled together)—are always intending to report him to the Commandant; but that the Commandant had not, when our informant wrote, made any visit of inspection to the gaol for above two and a-half months. This is said to have given such a feeling of irresponsibility to the gaoler, that he has greatly abused his position, ordering and, above all, permitting things which reflect great disgrace on the authorities. Among other things, the water seems to be brought by convicts from Usher Fort for the supply of the prisoners; and the supply which ought to be for the use of the prisoners, is given away to friends of the gaoler, while the debtors and criminal prisoners are dying with thirst. The debtor prisoners, it is said, cannot get water to drink from the Government tank, but it has to be purchased by or for them, the charge being one shilling for a pot of good water and threepence for blackish; and that, as it is impossible they should continue to be thus supplied, either at their own expense or that of their creditors, it may be expected that they will, many of them, really perish through want of water, as they cannot, moreover, get any with which to wash themselves, which will certainly tend rapidly to loathsome sickness and death. Our informant asks whether, under the law of imprisonment for debt, it is intended that the debtors shall be brought into the gaol to be killed; or whether they are supposed to be lodged there in order to induce them to pay their debts? Criminal prisoners, who may be able to pay in money or rum, are further stated to be allowed the most shamefully licentious indulgencies. We must say that if a tithe of what our informant writes—details of which we cannot possibly give—be true, the negligence of the superior authorities has led to most cruel and disgraceful evils, which call for immediate action on the part of the Commandant; or, if he continue to neglect his duty in this respect, on the part of the Governor, Captain Strahan, who, as we have understood, effected a great reform in the Gaol of Lagos by his visits to that establishment and the abuses he there corrected. We are not dealing here with the question of imprisonment for debt; and it must not be for one moment considered, because we call for reform in the system of treatment of debtor prisoners, as well as that of criminal prisoners, that we have therefore fallen away from our often expressed conviction, that imprisonment for debt, as debt, is an abomination that ought not to be permitted longer to exist in any dependencies of the British Crown.

C. Finlason and others, the disgraceful condition of the places in which prisoners were confined at Cape Coast. The statements were of course denied, though every word of them was true; but as a speedy reform followed the exposure, and our bringing the matter, which we did, under the immediate attention of the Government, we were satisfied to allow the official abuse heaped upon us to remain unanswered, treating it with the contempt which alone it deserved. A subsequent exposure by us of malpractices in Bathurst Gaol led also to improvements there, amid showers of abuse on the offending Editor of the African Times. But now we feel as if we had been guilty of a dereliction of duty, although, of course, we can only expose those evils and abuses which are communicated to us, so in spite of all that rebuked officials say of us, we never invent grievances and abuses. Our invaluable co-operator, Mr. Rainy, has lately enabled us, by a letter of his, to bring the state of the Sierra Leone prisons under public notice. The fault there is the absence of classification, and the herding together of prisoners in a manner that can only lead to an increase of crime and a most vicious demoralisation. The evidence in the case of Joseph Gordon, which occupies so much space in our (this month enlarged) paper, shows that the reformed Bathurst Gaol is in need of many further reforms, among which must be placed the medical examination of every prisoner before he is set to work, the prohibition of punishments by mere verbal order of authorities, however exalted, and the making the visiting justices responsible for a due demand on the Executive for such clothing and bedding, &c., as are absolutely essential to the health of the prisoners. Last year we had to denounce the cells of Accra prisons, in which the life of poor Thomas Williams was so cruelly sacrificed—and the improvised powder-magazine dungeon in which it pleased Mr. Ussher, Mr. Parker, and Dr. Skues that poor Mr. Finlason should be tortured. And now again Cape Coast, that hotbed of all official abuses and mismanagement, iniquity, and oppression, crops up in a most offensive way. We had hoped that our former exposure of Cape Coast prisons, and it being known that we are never without correspondents in Cape Coast, would have insured the permanency of those sanitary reforms that ensued on our such former exposure; but we can only suppose that the virtual approval by the Colonial-office of all the official atrocities of Ussher, Parker, Skues and others by the promotion of Parker,—the whitewashing of Skues, whom, contrary to all reliable evidence, the Duke of Buckingham did not consider at all responsible for the death of poor Williams,—and the non-dismissal of Ussher and others from the service, has had the intelligible effect of inducing the present authorities there to believe that they may do whatever seemeth good in their own eyes, without fear of censure; and that to this is owing the state of the Cape Coast prison described in our last number. It is our duty to repeat it. Such a state of a Government prison is too shameful to allow of our passing it by with a mere condemnation of the atrocity of sending such a man as Mr. Lovell into it.

But our great object is not notoriety for ourselves even in the good work we are performing, but the speedy and effective correction of evil. The charges contained in that letter against certain individuals, whose names we have not considered it necessary at present to insert, were too serious to admit of our public action without our obtaining what we might be justified in considering a full confirmation of them from others than the persons to whom we were originally indebted for the revelation. That confirmation we soon obtained. By this we do not mean a full confirmation of all there set forth, but of the alleged fact that prisoners are chained and otherwise ill-treated before trial, and have been also cruelly dealt with. But we felt convinced, also, that Her Majesty\'s Government were the first who ought to be made acquainted with the information we had received.

This young man was summoned to the presence of the Dutch Governor, and asked if he knew who was the writer of the obnoxious letters. He was even offered two dollars (8s. 4d. sterling!) to perjure himself, and say that either Scheffelaur, Lejeune, Kamerling, or Bartels (the three former in service, the latter a private individual), had written the letters and palmed them on the natives; but as the young man knew nothing of the matter, he replied, ""If you were to offer me ever so much, I could not tell you."" Hereupon he was assailed with a volley of Dutch expletives, in which the letter r rolls and predominates, like an under current in one of Haydn\'s fugues; then his Excellency the Governor, the gallant Colonel Elias, orders the young man to be cast into prison to ruminate on the matter.

The prisoners remained on board all day long, fastened up and exposed to the burning heat, with the result that nests of maggots formed in their bloody and swollen limbs. And this torture all day long in the tropical heat, and without food or drink of any kind! When, therefore, the poor prisoners were near dying of hunger, they were simply shot down like wild beasts. The official reports celebrate such a campaign as one of the greatest deeds of heroism of the century. Paper is patient and no one knows or publishes what deeds of wantonness and crime are done in the Dark Continent.\n\nMarch 31, 1893.—During my illness Assessor Wehlau returned from his new campaign. He brought no prisoners. As they—so he remarked at dinner—all die when they get here, he had them killed on board (his exact words were, ""Let them have a couple of knocks on the head a-piece""). Then he went on to say that the Native soldiers, one in particular, had a famous dodge for drawing the skin off an enemy\'s skull. A slit was made with a knife in the lower jaw, then a hold was got with the teeth, and the whole scalp lifted off the face and head.

The Governor must know something of all this. Lieut. Schröder, in fact, plainly expressed his indignation at this procedure, to which the brutal manner of Assessor Wehlau gave a peculiar character.

What we have heard from time to time of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen has led us to entertain a high opinion of his character and abilities, and we may therefore be allowed at the very commencement of our observations on these revolting and disgraceful facts to express the hope that he will ""exercise, as regards them, a little ordinary intelligence,"" descend altogether from official stilts and from the clouds of Colonial-office obstinacy and indifference, and grapple with them, damning and distressing as they are, in a spirit of energy and determination that the name and rule of Great Britain shall not be thus disgraced with impunity in a British settlement. It is not a new thing for us to have to expose the illegal and atrocious barbarities of Gold Coast gaols within the British Protectorate. We have waged war with these abominations during many long years, sometimes with good results. But, alas, the Hydra has so many heads, that though one be cut off the deadly wound is healed at once by Colonial-office styptics and indifference, and the battle has to be begun anew. Of course we have been always wrong in official quarters—of course we have never exercised that ""little ordinary intelligence"" which should have convinced us that things were not that were. We do not complain of this; it is the usual fate of reformers of abuses, and we are as ready to encounter it again as we were when first we published the indignant denunciations by Finlason of the disgusting state of the prisons at Cape Coast and the infamous cruelties practised therein, when Mr. Richard Pine, lately rewarded with a pension, was Governor, and Mr. Michael Doorley his Inspector of Prisons; and as we were in our crusade in the cause of outraged humanity against Admiral Patey\'s shot-drill practice in Bathurst Gaol. But it is natural we should ask ourselves, when is there to be a permanent change for the better? when is illegality and cruelty to be put an end to in those British West African Settlements? We answer, instructed by the Past, Never, until the Colonial-office shows sufficient sense of what is due to the British name, as to punish swiftly and severely those who commit and permit them. When Mr. Finlason denounced the Cape Coast prisons, things were allowed to be made quite right for Mr. Pine and Mr. Doorley; when we rescued Finlason and the Bannermans from the official clutches in which they were on the point of perishing, especially the former, Mr. Parker was promoted to St. Helena, and Mr. Usher, after a lengthy stay in England, was allowed to resume his administration; when we showed how Mr. Acting Chief Justice Huggins, at Sierra Leone, had violated law and humanity in his criminal sentences (many of which the Colonial-office has since been compelled to admit were illegal), he was made a permanent Judge of the Supreme Court, and still remains there; when we exposed the shameful shot-drill practices in Bathurst Gaol, and Admiral Patey could no longer be kept at the Gambia, he, too, was promoted to St. Helena. What compensation has Mr. Lovell ever obtained for his incarceration in the filthy cells at Cape Coast, or what rebuke was ever administered to the unjust officials and the complacent magistrate by whom the outrage was perpetrated? None! Is it any wonder, then, that we have continually to begin our work anew? We are not surprised at it, although we do own to occasional discouragement in this task of continually rolling the stone up the hill, with but little, if any, assistance from those who will be most benefited by our success.

Hereof a few words: ""A convict prisoner recently absconded from gaol and was recaptured. He was then flogged as a punishment for having run away, and while still suffering very severely from the effects of the flogging, he was put to shot-drill, during which he fainted. He was carried to the hospital, and there died in a shocking manner. An inquest was held, and it came out in evidence that the manner in which it has been customary to carry on prison discipline is extremely reprehensible, seeming to savour strongly of inhuman cruelty.

The coroner's inquest, which took place in July last, reveals a state of things more worthy of the most barbarous ages, than of the civilisation and sanitary advancement of the year 1868. The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying.

Men otherwise good and humane look upon it, by the force of habit, with a neglectful indifference, really sinful—since they will not give themselves the least trouble to do for others, what they would, under like circumstances, desire that others should do for them. Things seem to remain in the gaol at Sierra Leone precisely as they were when we brought the condition of the debt prisoners there under public notice, and directed to it the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, some months ago. Again the harrowing cry of anguish and despair reaches us in the letter which we publish in another column. We know nothing of the individual in question, or of the circumstances connected with the indebtedness for which he is suffering; but this we do know, that if the statement made in the simple words of the letter, that the writer has been confined in gaol for _sixteen months,_ and that he has _again_ (showing a previous application) _filed his schedule, but that no notice is taken of it_ —if this statement, we say, be true (and it will have been a gross act of folly for a man to write us a lie on the subject), then there is something in the administration of the law in Sierra Leone, which demands the instant attention of Downing-street with a view to remedy. ""To me,"" the victim writes, ""it appears that nothing but death will remove me from this prison."" And this in Sierra Leone, a British Crown colony! If a fact, it is an atrociously disgraceful one. Sierra Leone has a bench of two Judges, receiving a joint salary of \'some 3,000l. a-year, to administer justice in a population of some forty thousand people; and here is a debted prisoner of sixteen months, filing anew his schedule, and crying to us that all his communications to the authorities regarding it are unheeded. If this man has committed fraud which justly deserves punishment, why was he not punished for it; not by detention without judgment, but by sentence of the Court. If he had not committed fraud, his case ought to have been inquired into, without any unnecessary delay, so soon as he had filed his schedule; and the necessary formalities being complied with, he should have had his discharge. For what are insolvency laws but for this,—to prevent the detention in prison of a mere debtor who has surrendered all he possessed to his creditors? If such a state of things as this now complained of exists in Sierra Leone—if the local influence of wealthy creditors can thus prevail there against a man, in defiance of the law to which he is allowed to appeal in vain,—can it be matter of surprise that we should have insisted so strongly as we have done against the appointment of a local Chief Justice for the Gold Coast Colony? We take this opportunity to renew our protest against such an appointment; although we fear, since the removal of Mr. Chalmers from Sierra Leone to be Queen\'s advocate for the Gold Coast Colony, that our protest will not _at this time_ prevail. But to return to the subject of this complaint from the Debtors\' Gaol of Sierra Leone, and the gross injustice which we have now no alternative but to believe is judicially committed or permitted there. Does not this case speak volumes against the longer continuance of imprisonment for debt in the colonies and settlements of West Africa? The more facts crowd upon us, the more are we strengthened in our former unchangeable conviction, that imprisonment for debt, _as debt,_ is deserving the execration of every Christian man, is an outrage on humanity, as well as a great social mistake. We pray the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the case of this prisoner of sixteen months (who has more than once filed his schedule) in the Debtors\' Gaol of Sierra Leone, and the case of the other debt prisoners there, may be immediately inquired into. If the complaints made to us, and on which we have now been commenting, are well-founded, we feel compelled further to say, that we cannot exonerate the Governor of Sierra Leone from all blame. With so limited a community as that of Sierra Leone under his charge, there ought not to be a case of injustice within the colony, resulting from mal-administration of the law, not known of by him; and which, being thus known of by him, could remain without effectual inquiry on his part.

The Foreman observed that the prisoners have been in the state they now are for years, and that the Administrator had been down and seen them repeatedly.)\n\nThe jury here retired to examine the cell in which the deceased had been confined, and where he had died, and after a few minutes\' consultation returned the following verdict in writing:—\n\n""The Jury are of opinion that the deceased Charles Williams came to his death from natural causes, accelerated and aggravated by the deplorable state of the cell in which he was confined; also that the cell in which he was confined was too crowded with three persons sleeping in it, and, on inspection, there does not appear sufficient ventilation in the cell in which he was confined, and the jury think that great negligence is to be imputed to the Government for allowing the prisons to remain in such a shocking state, and the jury are sorry that Dr. Skues, the Acting-Commandant, knowing the prison to be unfit for Europeans, did not release him or have him removed.—(Signed) Charles Russell, J.P., Coroner, John J.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'Anti-colonial movements in East Africa to 1914', 'content': ""and this failure did indeed make 'the passing of the old societies inevitable'. 49 On the whole, between 1890 and 1914 dramatic changes took place in East Africa.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced.

In the first place, as S.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

In large measure, colonial rule ultimately collapsed in Africa because of the declining ability - a combined financial, military, and moral condition of Europeans to continue it in the face of African nationalist pressure. Yet within the terminal decade of colonialism, the pre-established methods of control were influential in determining the process of change. The administrative matters of identity and differentiation and of centralization and local autonomy then became effective determinants. The smoothest transmission of power, as will be seen in the concluding volume of this History, was that accomplished through the English 'Westminster system', the outgrowth of the colonial legislative councils through which methods of political opposition were developed, as is most evident in the independence of the Gold Coast as Ghana. The most radical change was that which occurred in French Algeria and, more recently, in the Portuguese settler colonies of Angola and Mozambique, where the assimilationist approach held that these areas were overseas extensions of the national state.\nDiversity of colonial method was not as important historically as was the similarity in assessment of the colonial situation. Despite the pronouncements enshrined in the documents of the League of Nations, and in defiance of their weakened global positions as a result of the World War, the European powers in Africa did not entertain thoughts of political devolution in the inter-war period. Egypt excepted, Africa was seen as the one continent in which colonialism would be of very long duration, and colonial methods were all designed to accommodate European interests and intentions. Therefore, the essential political activity was one of African adjustment to European objectives, regardless of whether the particular colonial practice followed was indirect or not.\nMost important of all the historical developments of the inter-war period, the colonial system established the general administrative framework in which national government would be housed in the first decade of independence.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

It is on this distinction between men and things that all justice, human and divine, is founded."" That this dictum, laid down by high authority, has been from generation to generation violated in Africa and with the Africans by so-called European Christians is patent to every one. Africa is designated, and with but too much truth, as pre-eminently the land of darkness. But dark as Africa is, even the deepest darkness of her superstitious and barbarian night is not so dark as are the pages of that volume in the history of Christendom which chronicles the dealings of European nations, among whose people the blessed precepts of the divine Gospel of peace and love had been promulgated and, nominally at least, received for more than ten centuries, with those stigmatised heathen, who, in the great day of final retribution, may as justly rise up in judgment against our forefathers as may Sodom and Gomorrah against the wilful rejection of the incarnate Son of God. For after all those long centuries of greater or less acquaintance with the doctrine of universal love which Christianity proclaims, they swooped down upon Africa like foul birds of prey, or demons let loose from hell. It is a dreadful volume, and we daily pronounce the condemnation of those whose deeds are there recorded, when in our unreasonable and uncharitable impatience to obtain immediate Christian results for every paltry pound, or even shilling, that we spend in God\'s service among the heathen we denounce as conclusive evidence of his non-conversion every delinquency, every backsliding of the poor African, who, only a few years ago first heard of Christ and His great salvation, and nominally, and we believe in very many cases really, embraced that glorious hope of everlasting life and joy. We cannot see the beam in our own eye—only the mote in our poor brother\'s eye. And although as a national crime with regard to Africa, ours is a thing of the past, the necessity for the continued presence of our slave-repression squadron off the coast of Africa proves, alas! but too well that Christendom has not yet cleared itself from the foul guilt in which it so long revelled at the cost of the blood and tears of Africa. But it is not alone the remnant of the foreign slave-trade which proves that the old leaven which made men look upon Africans as a prey to be devoured, and not as wounded neighbours they were bound to succour, still exists in the European mind. The way in which we nationally grumble of late at the cost of the paltry little bottles of oil and wine that we are supposed to have been pouring into their wounds also proves it. And the Dutch settlements on the Gold Coast afford strong evidence of it. We hope that, after four years\' publication of this journal, our readers know us too well to have supposed that we were giving insertion to the letters which have appeared in it on the subject of ""Dutch African Government"" merely because they were more or less well written, and amusing in some of the incidents related in them. We feel very strongly the necessity of a radical change in the system, the ends, and aims, and objects of Dutch government on the Gold Coast. The ends, aims, and objects are low and vile, and the system and its administrators (as a general rule, to which, however, there are of course exceptions) are not less so. A little trade, a little gold dust, three or four hundred slaves every year for service in Java, under the name of enlisted free soldiers, and the reputation of still having possessions in Africa—are the ends, aims, and objects in view in retaining and keeping up the name of rule and government in those countries. Men—Africans—are still there considered as things, as mere means to an end. Nothing is done to spread civilization and Christianity among them. There is little or no education bestowed—little or no Christian teaching offered. We have freed ourselves, we believe, from Juggernaut in India, but the Dutch patronise, and countenance, and subsidise the wretched and degrading Fetish superstition, whose high priests are murderers, and whose rites are debauchery and every vice. We have felt it our duty to this country, to Africa, and even to the Dutch Government itself, to use the means at our command for exposing this. There are high and honourable men taking part in the Dutch government at the Hague. There are, doubtless, a goodly number of really Christian men in the Dutch Chambers, in whose eyes all this ought to be and must be considered abominable and dishonouring. We indulge the belief that all that is needed to bring about a change is to show these eminent individuals precisely what the thing is with which they are connected, and which they uphold on the African coast, at the cost of something like 11,000l. sterling per annum. Surely it is not worth while to pay money for such disgraceful results? And our exposure of so evil a course has nothing in it that ought to be deemed offensive, or to wound the national pride of the people of the Netherlands. We have proved ourselves to be impartial censors. We do not conceal British errors, British delinquencies and shortcomings in Africa. We do not assume a national pharisaical attitude and position, and point to our national Dutch neighbour as ""that publican."" We have but too much cause even yet to smite upon our own breasts, and confess our unworthiness. But at the same time justice demands that we should say, the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, with such a system, and such men as for the most part administer it, are a great obstacle in the way of British effort to ameliorate the condition of the people of those countries, and bring them within the pale of Christian civilization, with its attendant industrial results. It is bad enough to have to deal with the deep-rooted native vices, and errors, and industrial inertia, without having a focus of aggravated demoralization in neighbouring European settlements to contend with and against also. It is bad enough for us to be occasionally betrayed by our own officials falling under the influence of native vices, instead of setting the example of ennobling Christian virtues, without having in neighbouring settlements what looks at least like an organised system of deliberate continuous evil, under which the very worst practices are personally shared in, and fostered, and encouraged by the chief European authorities. We do not believe that the Dutch Government at the Hague can have been cognisant of what has taken place and what has been done and practised in its name and under its authority at Elmina and elsewhere on the Gold Coast; and in exposing it, so that it may be brought inoffensively beneath their notice, we are not only rendering a service to Africa, but doing as we would have men do to us were we in a position that made us, as they are, morally responsible for acts which bring so much dishonour on the European name. We are not surprised that the local authorities in the Dutch settlements should especially abominate and determine to get rid of Africans who have received education at Sierra Leone or other British settlements. This is only an additional evidence of the influence for good that Sierra Leone and other colonies and settlements where missionaries are bestowing the great civilising boon and agent, education, are exerting on the West Coast of Africa. But we shall feel surprised if the home Netherland authorities, who after all are the real ones, show that they are equally opposed to African advancement. And we look, therefore, for some good results of our labours in this direction also. We have begun with the Dutch settlements and with the evils which they foster and engender—the nuisance which they create. We have no intention of leaving them until such a change shall have been produced as may enable us to praise instead of blame, to eulogise instead of to denounce. And if the Dutch recognise such a change to be impossible under their rule, which we cannot conceive, we should only say, get rid of a responsibility which not only dishonours you in the eyes of the Christian world, but which will assuredly weigh heavily upon you in some way, and at some time or other, in the providential dispensation of Him who ruleth among the nations, and in whose fiat is empire or ruin—prosperity or decay.'}, {'id': 2273, 'article_title': 'Memorial of Fynn, Fynn, and Forson, Claiming Compensation', 'full_section_title': 'Memorial of Fynn, Fynn, and Forson, Claiming Compensation', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1872#article-23', 'issue_date': '23_07_1872', 'content': 'Much praise is due to the old chief, Amagarsbi, of Quittah, for his conduct on this occasion.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

The monsters of whom it is for the major part composed deserve universal execration. This majority consists of the Dutch Boers, the old farmers of the Cape territory, who at the time of the Slave Emancipation Act refused to live under British rule without the institution of slavery. By an act of what must be called criminal weakness in a Christian Government, we allowed them to throw off their allegiance and migrate to the native territories beyond our frontier, to spread desolation among the tribes of the interior. Men who were capable of abandoning their homesteads and properties, where they and their fathers had lived for several generations, because they could be no longer permitted to hold slaves there, and make slave raids among the surrounding natives, were not likely to behave with much moderation when freed from all control. After sundry vicissitudes and migrations, they finally settled on what is now called the territory of the Transvaal Republic. This country is about 300 miles by 400 miles, and one of the finest in South Africa. When men go among savages to found what they term a civilised state, and sword and musket in hand to conquer a territory, we do not expect to find them patterns of Christian humanity and justice. But these men have behaved and continue to behave more like demons than men. They have gradually extended depopulation around them, with one sole object—that of robbing cattle and making slaves. And incredible as it may seem, they have glossed over their atrocious proceedings with a semblance of humanity. Their Government calls out a commando, or armed expedition, to go in a certain direction—a pretext is, of course, never wanting; they kill, burn, rob, and destroy, but they invariably bring back with them large numbers of native children, boys and girls, from two to three years old up to ten and twelve. These they call deserted children, having first murdered their parents, and these children are partly divided among the commando by lot, and partly distributed among the guiding spirits, the fathers of the Republic, the President, and his immediate adherents. Under the name of apprentices, they bring up these for slaves and concubines. We are sorry to have to say that among these organised ruffians there are a number of English vagabonds, who have cast their lot with them for the more free gratification of their evil passions and propensities. Compared with the monsters of this Transvaal Republic, the inhabitants of the Orange Free State—between whom and the Basutos we have interfered for the preservation of the latter from a war of extermination—are models of moderation and virtue. It is justly observed in South Africa that, though the Orange Free State people brought home much plunder in cattle, they never found any deserted children. But these children are with the Transvaal Republicans a main object of their expeditions. Too wise to fill their houses with adult captives, who, strong in numbers, might become dangerous, and who would be continually escaping, they bring up in these children a race of domestic slaves. And these atrocious crimes are perpetrated by escaped British subjects, not very far beyond the limits of British jurisdiction. We have long felt that this ought to be put a stop to; but we did not see a ray of hope until the late interference for the preservation of the Basutos. Now there is a gleam of light on that dark horizon. By a strange movement in the native mind, interior tribes beyond this Republic are entreating to be taken under British protection. They look upon this as the only escape from their own intestine discords, and that atrocious war of extermination constantly waged by the Transvaal burghers for the rescue of deserted children. There has been also a gradual infiltration of better men, British and others, who have settled in the towns in that fine territory. These held a public meeting lately to protest against a new commando that had been ordered, and against the whole system. But this, we are sorry to say, did not prevent the commando going forth, so that there will be another episode of murder and deserted children. Meanwhile the President and his saintly council of Boers, have taken a step that only the culminating madness of hitherto successful wickedness could have prompted. We have said their territory, as heretofore claimed, is 300 miles by 400 miles—a tolerably ample territory one would have imagined for a community of about 15,000. But Murch\'s gold discoveries on the north, the movement in the native mind toward British protection, the desire of an outlet on the Coast, and the rumoured purchase of the Delagoa Bay Territories by the Prussians from the Portuguese, have spurred these magnates to a daring leap. By a proclamation, the President has extended the limits of the Transvaal Republic over several degrees of latitude and longitude; so as to include the real or supposed gold-fields, a portion of the sea-coast, and a large extension westward, and, among many other tribes, those who have been so wisely bold as to ask for British protection. A correspondent of the Natal Mercury, writing from Potchefstroom, the capital town of this race of man-demons, justly says: ""This decree is sublime. Whatever is, is right; whatever is proclaimed, ipse facto, becomes Transvaal Territory. Mr. Pretorious steals from the Portuguese and Zulus in the East; from Malgen, Moselekatse, and others in the north; and from a number of native chiefs in the west and south-west."" We have given some idea of these people who thus annex territories to be a fresh field for commandos, but a few additional facts will not be out of place. At the meeting at Potchefstroom, to which we have alluded, the Rev. Mr. Ludorf stated ""that on one particular occasion, a number of native children, who were too young to be removed, had been collected in a heap, covered over with long grass, and burnt alive; other atrocities had likewise been committed, but these were too horrible to relate"": the whole thing is too horrible to dwell upon. There has been such an infiltration of civilising influences by missionary exertion and communication with the Natal colony, &c., that the greater part of native Southern Africa exhibits manifest tokens of a desire to be allowed to live in peace and progress under the British flag; very many both in the Orange Free State and in the Transvaal Republic desire the same thing; and all that is now wanting is for the British Government to declare what has always been understood on the Coast, that its territory there extends uninterruptedly to the junction with that of the Portuguese in Delagoa Bay, and includes all territory south of the line of the twenty-sixth degree of south latitude; while it is ready to extend its protection to any interior tribes north of this limit, who may be ready to conform to British regulations. In this way, Africa, from the Zambesi to the Cape, will become civilised, and form eventually a magnificent South African native empire. This would really cost nothing to England; and we think, too, that if Portugal is inclined to sell her East African Territories in and from Delagoa Bay to the Zambesi, Great Britain is entitled to the preference. The Cape Colony and Natal would be glad enough to pay the interest of the money that might be advanced by the Imperial Government for that purpose, until they could redeem the debt.

Of course we can only expect this from independent, high-minded men, who are indifferent to paltry official bribes, and fearless of official disfavour; but surely there are some of these to be found in every British settlement on the West Coast, and we leave the matter for the present in their hands.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1871#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCRA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have complaints from Accra that one who at least calls himself a European, and who is designated to us as an ""Overseer,"" is not pursuing that course of propriety and upright performance of duty which would reflect credit on the Government by whom he has been appointed.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental.

There are numerous inaccuracies in the official reports. Assessor Wehlau, the leader of the expedition, while the villages were burning, gave orders that some old women should have their throats cut; as for men, he could not take prisoners. Instead of the 150 prisoners of the official report, there were, according to my informant, only twelve or fifteen. Weary, wounded, half-starving, covered with bruises and sores, these few—mostly old women, greybeards, and children—were landed from the ship and beaten and shoved in fetters to the prison.

PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Congo Traders and their Grievances', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The final outcome of the Anti-Slavery Conference is not yet reached. On the refusal of Holland to concur in the import duties on merchandise in the Congo Free State, opinions of a contemptuous nature were freely expressed by the official organs of several of the assembled Powers. The members of the Conference granted Holland six months to reconsider their action and sign the document relative to the import duties.\n\nYet the opinion seems gaining ground that Holland was pursuing a course best calculated for the protection of her own subjects. It is sometimes urged that the interests of civilisation and religion should not be fettered by the commercial interests of a handful of traders; but the whole advance from the savagery of the interior to the order of the coast tribes has been due to the better conditions made possible by this handful of traders. While pursuing a legitimate commerce with the natives, slavery has practically disappeared from the borders of Africa. Despite the objections of theorists, industry and thrift have augmented, crimes of violence are rarely heard of, and disputes and fights are of meagre proportions.\n\nIt is, then, not fair to disdain the interests of the traders, in an Anti-Slavery Conference of the Powers. The traders may fairly retort that the Congo State, founded to advance civilisation and Christianity in the Dark Continent, has paid £10,000 for ivory to the most powerful slave dealer in Central Africa; that on storming a native village they kidnap the children and keep them in slavery until they are presumably twenty-five years of age; that the excesses of their hired Zanzibari slaves have resulted in the complete desolation of wide regions bordering their caravan roads!\n\nWhat has Holland done to provoke the ire of her colleagues? She assented to the anti-slavery proposals of the Conference; and acquiesced in the imposition of import duties on spirits. Her offence is her refusal to agree to the imposition of import dues on all articles of commerce—a totally distinct proposal from the general act of the Conference; a proposal at variance with the act of the Berlin Conference of 1884, which declares that no such duties shall be levied for twenty years.\n\nIt has been pointed out that import duties would be much more onerous, vexatious, and unfair in their incidence than the existing export duties, and as these have been suddenly augmented and backed up by an intricate system of licenses and heavy taxation, the traders of English, French, and Portuguese nationalities have stirred their Press in support of the Dutch action.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Congo Traders and their Grievances', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is extracted from a letter received from a Liverpool gentleman who has had many years\' experience of trading on the Congo: ""If the various Governments interested can only be moved to look into the question of duties, it is difficult to see how they will be able to sanction such an enormous amount of squeezing out of the few traders who by fair promises were induced to establish in the Free State territory and the traders established in the Lower Congo long before the Free State was ever dreamed of, and who have not benefited in any way from it. From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King. How long will it take to open up the Dark Continent to the boasted advantages of civilisation if the pioneers are to be hampered and hindered by the Governments who ought to help them to the utmost?""\n\nIt may be asked why Holland should especially bestir itself in Congo matters more than other nations? The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England.

These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations.

It highlights the negative impact of colonial economic policies, including the emphasis on cash crops over food production, leading to malnutrition and famine, but does not provide specific information about Dutch activities or policies. In contrast, The African Times articles offer detailed support for the claim, describing the Dutch government's parsimony in funding African settlements, with officials often undercompensated and holding multiple positions. This financial reluctance is linked to the Dutch administration's failure to prioritize education or Christian teaching, as they subsidized local superstitions instead. The articles emphasize the Dutch focus on economic gains, such as trade and gold dust, and their use of African recruits for service in Java, aligning with the claim of economic considerations threatening stability. Additionally, the Dutch refusal to levy customs duties and reliance on British military support indicate a lack of investment in sustainable governance. The articles suggest that the Dutch presence hindered British efforts to improve the region, reinforcing the claim that their administration impeded development and modernization.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Was the colonial impact on Africa in the economic field, then, such a very enviable one?

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads.

Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""All these expressions of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics constituted the antithesis in the dialectical relationship between the European colonizers and the colonized Africans.

But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Currency and banking', 'content': ""These two banks completely dominated banking activities in British West Africa throughout the colonial period.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

That this dictum, laid down by high authority, has been from generation to generation violated in Africa and with the Africans by so-called European Christians is patent to every one. Africa is designated, and with but too much truth, as pre-eminently the land of darkness. But dark as Africa is, even the deepest darkness of her superstitious and barbarian night is not so dark as are the pages of that volume in the history of Christendom which chronicles the dealings of European nations, among whose people the blessed precepts of the divine Gospel of peace and love had been promulgated and, nominally at least, received for more than ten centuries, with those stigmatised heathen, who, in the great day of final retribution, may as justly rise up in judgment against our forefathers as may Sodom and Gomorrah against the wilful rejection of the incarnate Son of God. For after all those long centuries of greater or less acquaintance with the doctrine of universal love which Christianity proclaims, they swooped down upon Africa like foul birds of prey, or demons let loose from hell. It is a dreadful volume, and we daily pronounce the condemnation of those whose deeds are there recorded, when in our unreasonable and uncharitable impatience to obtain immediate Christian results for every paltry pound, or even shilling, that we spend in God\'s service among the heathen we denounce as conclusive evidence of his non-conversion every delinquency, every backsliding of the poor African, who, only a few years ago first heard of Christ and His great salvation, and nominally, and we believe in very many cases really, embraced that glorious hope of everlasting life and joy. We cannot see the beam in our own eye—only the mote in our poor brother\'s eye. And although as a national crime with regard to Africa, ours is a thing of the past, the necessity for the continued presence of our slave-repression squadron off the coast of Africa proves, alas! but too well that Christendom has not yet cleared itself from the foul guilt in which it so long revelled at the cost of the blood and tears of Africa. But it is not alone the remnant of the foreign slave-trade which proves that the old leaven which made men look upon Africans as a prey to be devoured, and not as wounded neighbours they were bound to succour, still exists in the European mind. The way in which we nationally grumble of late at the cost of the paltry little bottles of oil and wine that we are supposed to have been pouring into their wounds also proves it. And the Dutch settlements on the Gold Coast afford strong evidence of it. We hope that, after four years\' publication of this journal, our readers know us too well to have supposed that we were giving insertion to the letters which have appeared in it on the subject of ""Dutch African Government"" merely because they were more or less well written, and amusing in some of the incidents related in them. We feel very strongly the necessity of a radical change in the system, the ends, and aims, and objects of Dutch government on the Gold Coast. The ends, aims, and objects are low and vile, and the system and its administrators (as a general rule, to which, however, there are of course exceptions) are not less so. A little trade, a little gold dust, three or four hundred slaves every year for service in Java, under the name of enlisted free soldiers, and the reputation of still having possessions in Africa—are the ends, aims, and objects in view in retaining and keeping up the name of rule and government in those countries. Men—Africans—are still there considered as things, as mere means to an end. Nothing is done to spread civilization and Christianity among them. There is little or no education bestowed—little or no Christian teaching offered. We have freed ourselves, we believe, from Juggernaut in India, but the Dutch patronise, and countenance, and subsidise the wretched and degrading Fetish superstition, whose high priests are murderers, and whose rites are debauchery and every vice. We have felt it our duty to this country, to Africa, and even to the Dutch Government itself, to use the means at our command for exposing this. There are high and honourable men taking part in the Dutch government at the Hague. There are, doubtless, a goodly number of really Christian men in the Dutch Chambers, in whose eyes all this ought to be and must be considered abominable and dishonouring. We indulge the belief that all that is needed to bring about a change is to show these eminent individuals precisely what the thing is with which they are connected, and which they uphold on the African coast, at the cost of something like 11,000l. sterling per annum. Surely it is not worth while to pay money for such disgraceful results? And our exposure of so evil a course has nothing in it that ought to be deemed offensive, or to wound the national pride of the people of the Netherlands. We have proved ourselves to be impartial censors. We do not conceal British errors, British delinquencies and shortcomings in Africa. We do not assume a national pharisaical attitude and position, and point to our national Dutch neighbour as ""that publican."" We have but too much cause even yet to smite upon our own breasts, and confess our unworthiness. But at the same time justice demands that we should say, the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, with such a system, and such men as for the most part administer it, are a great obstacle in the way of British effort to ameliorate the condition of the people of those countries, and bring them within the pale of Christian civilization, with its attendant industrial results. It is bad enough to have to deal with the deep-rooted native vices, and errors, and industrial inertia, without having a focus of aggravated demoralization in neighbouring European settlements to contend with and against also. It is bad enough for us to be occasionally betrayed by our own officials falling under the influence of native vices, instead of setting the example of ennobling Christian virtues, without having in neighbouring settlements what looks at least like an organised system of deliberate continuous evil, under which the very worst practices are personally shared in, and fostered, and encouraged by the chief European authorities. We do not believe that the Dutch Government at the Hague can have been cognisant of what has taken place and what has been done and practised in its name and under its authority at Elmina and elsewhere on the Gold Coast; and in exposing it, so that it may be brought inoffensively beneath their notice, we are not only rendering a service to Africa, but doing as we would have men do to us were we in a position that made us, as they are, morally responsible for acts which bring so much dishonour on the European name. We are not surprised that the local authorities in the Dutch settlements should especially abominate and determine to get rid of Africans who have received education at Sierra Leone or other British settlements. This is only an additional evidence of the influence for good that Sierra Leone and other colonies and settlements where missionaries are bestowing the great civilising boon and agent, education, are exerting on the West Coast of Africa. But we shall feel surprised if the home Netherland authorities, who after all are the real ones, show that they are equally opposed to African advancement. And we look, therefore, for some good results of our labours in this direction also. We have begun with the Dutch settlements and with the evils which they foster and engender—the nuisance which they create. We have no intention of leaving them until such a change shall have been produced as may enable us to praise instead of blame, to eulogise instead of to denounce. And if the Dutch recognise such a change to be impossible under their rule, which we cannot conceive, we should only say, get rid of a responsibility which not only dishonours you in the eyes of the Christian world, but which will assuredly weigh heavily upon you in some way, and at some time or other, in the providential dispensation of Him who ruleth among the nations, and in whose fiat is empire or ruin—prosperity or decay.'}, {'id': 1180, 'article_title': 'ENGLISH AND DUTCH TREATY.', 'full_section_title': 'ENGLISH AND DUTCH TREATY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1867#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_08_1867', 'content': '\n\nIn our May number we said that we had seen the map prepared by the Dutch Government, and that the whole country on each side of the boundary line was coloured *up to the Ashantee frontier* with the respective Dutch and English tints that designated their respective territories on the Coast, Wassaw, &c., bearing the Dutch hue. Our Gold Coast friends know well how ardently the Dutch have coveted the Wassaw territory, not only because of access to Ashantee, but also because of their supposed enormous value as gold-producing countries. When we saw, therefore, the map coloured as we have described, we thought it *significant*, and observed, ""The Dutch have lost no time in taking nominal possession of the gold districts."" The Treaty, however, since proves to us that they had good and valid reason for so doing. The first article of the Treaty (see page 24) contains two very important points: *""The boundary between the possessions [of the two Governments] will be a line drawn true north from the centre of the mouth of the Sweet River, as far as the boundary of the present Ashantee Kingdom.""* All the countries of the Protectorate, &c., from that boundary line eastward, are now declared to be *possessions* of the British Crown; all to the west of the line are Dutch possessions. The second point is that providing for a deviation of the line within three miles of the Coast, so as to retain as Dutch or British any villages which have been in habitual dependence on the respective Governments. How can we interpret all this, but that the ""anomalous position,"" as Lord Carnarvon justly terms it, is soon to be at an end? Is it not true that in every sense the Gold Coast will be from the 1st of January next at the commencement of an entirely new era? In future articles we shall look the altered position fully in the face. We feel that our duties and responsibilities are greatly increased by the change, and that it is necessary for us to place ourselves in a position to render to the inhabitants of the territories on the one hand, and to Her Majesty\'s Government on the other, that assistance which they will mutually require. We cannot, however, even now dismiss the subject without expressing a hope that the Dutch Government will enter upon the same just and wise course as respects the appropriation of revenue to the ""facilities of civilization"" which we expect from our own. It is well known that the Dutch tenure of their Gold Coast possessions has hitherto been a very precarious one. Independent of their still consenting to hold St. George d\'Elmina from the King of Ashantee, and to confess his rights of sovereignty by the payment of an annual rent or tribute, it is but too well known that their occupation of that and other points has only been preserved by the military and naval support which the British authorities were ever ready to give, and did give, whenever the Dutch found themselves in danger from the natives. Such support the Dutch will have no right to expect from us in future. It is their duty so to govern their territories (within the line of which we shall in future not possess anything) as to make themselves beloved by the natives; and so to *hold* them, that they may be able to defend themselves against all native attacks. These they will not be able to do without an entire change of system, and the introduction of measures, means, and appliances for the Christian civilization of the people—a work they have hitherto entirely neglected. It is only then they will be able to develop the enormous wealth of the rich Wassaw gold-fields—a valuable *possession* if dealt with on enlightened principles.'}, {'id': 2004, 'article_title': 'DUTCH SETTLEMENTS ON THE GOLD COAST', 'full_section_title': 'DUTCH SETTLEMENTS ON THE GOLD COAST', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1871#article-6', 'issue_date': '23_03_1871', 'content': 'A communication from the Hague, in the _Indépendence of Brussels_, says: ""The treaty for ceding the coast of Guinea to Great Britain has just been signed.

I am aware that the terms of a cession to us of the territory claimed by the Dutch were absolutely concluded at Cape Coast and Elmina in the earlier part of this year; but the repugnance of the Government at the Hague to part with what brings it no honour and less money has put an end to arrangements which would have enabled us to raise a local revenue from Customs dues sufficient to warrant an expenditure needed, not only for planning and widening roads, but for sinking wells, for promoting geological surveys, for encouraging the arts of agriculture, for constructing houses on better and healthier principles, and for establishing domestic benefits without number.

It appears that the question to be discussed was that of the two letters which had been addressed to the Minister of the Colonies at the Hague; and the course adopted by the sapient Dutch Governor was not to elicit whether the charges brought against one of his so-called officers (qy., creatures?) had any foundation in fact, but to find out what unlucky wight had dared to write the letters for the people; because if nobody had dared to write these letters, the complaints of the people would never have reached Holland; and no awkward questions would have been asked. The King and his chiefs declined to give the names of the party whom they had employed to write their letters, saying, ""These letters have been read over again to us here in the castle, and they contain nothing more nor less than what we had to say, and we alone are responsible for their contents, and not the mechanical agent we employed to embody our ideas in civilized language."" The Dutch Governor would not listen to this argument at all; he must have the writer exposed and punished, for he was the real delinquent.\n\nThis is part and parcel of the blind Dutch policy. Some years ago the people of Bussima, in Ahanta, sent a petition to the Dutch Governor at Elmina, praying for a schoolmaster to be sent to instruct their children, and offered to pay his salary and give\n\nhim a residence, and provide a suitable schoolroom. The idea could not be entertained, because, said the then Governor, ""If we educate the natives, we shall ruin the country!""\n\nThe people were threatened with imprisonment, fire, and flames, and to have their town blown down about their ears, if they persisted in their refusal to give up the delinquent writer; because, said the Governor, ""The King of Holland has sent me out with a man-of-war to punish you, if you refuse me the names of the writers of these letters."" A scene ensued that baffles all description, and that to any other government, otherwise constituted than the present one at Elmina, would have been most humiliating.

""What can be done with countries where only a very paltry revenue can be raised, and for which England is not disposed to make pecuniary sacrifices?"" has long been a general answer to all remonstrances. That ""paucity of revenue"" was no doubt a great obstacle in the way of improvements. Nor did the removal of the obstacle depend solely upon the British Government. The Dutch and British possessions were mixed up together on the Gold Coast; the Dutch would not make any arrangement with the English for levying uniform duties, and, indeed, declined levying any duties at all. There was consequently an arbitrary limit to the amount of duties which the British could impose. Increased beyond a certain amount, all trade must have gone to the free Dutch ports, and no revenue whatever would have been obtained. There were other evils involved in the Dutch occupation, which moved us to make strenuous efforts for effecting the purchase of the Dutch settlements by the British Government. Those exertions have failed because of the real or alleged incompetency of the Dutch Government to alienate any Dutch territory, except for a territorial equivalent. We regret this, and deeply, too, not because we are desirous of territorial aggrandisement for Great Britain, but because, notwithstanding our great failure of duty hitherto, we do believe the future Christian civilization and material prosperity of those countries to depend upon the continued presence of the British flag on the Gold Coast. It being impossible to obtain the Dutch possessions by purchase, even if the British Government could be brought to make the investment, the only alternative, if any good was to be hoped for, was an exchange and consolidation of Coast possessions by the Dutch and English Governments, coupled with an undertaking for a uniform rate of import duties. Negotiations with this object have been for some time in progress, and rumour has anticipated the fact of their favourable termination. But we believe we are correct in stating, that if not actually concluded in the manner that we and our friends on the Coast desire, they are at least so far advanced toward that point as to allow of our treating the exchange, &c., as un fait accompli. We have before us a Dutch Government map showing the proposed exchange. A line is drawn into the interior from Elmina. All to westward of this bears the Dutch colour, all to eastward the British. When the exchange is effected, Dix Cove, Apollonia, and Commendah will become Dutch possessions, while Cormantine, Apam, Mouree, Barracoe, and Dutch Accra will in future belong to Great Britain. As the line is drawn from the Coast to the Praah, and shows the whole of Wassaw, &c., under Dutch tint, we presume that Great Britain will have acquiesced in that renunciation of her protectorate made some time since by the Wassaws, and will not again receive them under it. This will not, of course, make the Wassaws Dutch, any more than it will make the Fantees, Assins, &c., English, but it will most likely be understood as preventing any interference by Great Britain in future with the native laws and administration, &c., in Wassaw, so long as Wassaw remains at peace with the countries of the British Protectorate.

It is on this distinction between men and things that all justice, human and divine, is founded."" That this dictum, laid down by high authority, has been from generation to generation violated in Africa and with the Africans by so-called European Christians is patent to every one. Africa is designated, and with but too much truth, as pre-eminently the land of darkness. But dark as Africa is, even the deepest darkness of her superstitious and barbarian night is not so dark as are the pages of that volume in the history of Christendom which chronicles the dealings of European nations, among whose people the blessed precepts of the divine Gospel of peace and love had been promulgated and, nominally at least, received for more than ten centuries, with those stigmatised heathen, who, in the great day of final retribution, may as justly rise up in judgment against our forefathers as may Sodom and Gomorrah against the wilful rejection of the incarnate Son of God. For after all those long centuries of greater or less acquaintance with the doctrine of universal love which Christianity proclaims, they swooped down upon Africa like foul birds of prey, or demons let loose from hell. It is a dreadful volume, and we daily pronounce the condemnation of those whose deeds are there recorded, when in our unreasonable and uncharitable impatience to obtain immediate Christian results for every paltry pound, or even shilling, that we spend in God\'s service among the heathen we denounce as conclusive evidence of his non-conversion every delinquency, every backsliding of the poor African, who, only a few years ago first heard of Christ and His great salvation, and nominally, and we believe in very many cases really, embraced that glorious hope of everlasting life and joy. We cannot see the beam in our own eye—only the mote in our poor brother\'s eye. And although as a national crime with regard to Africa, ours is a thing of the past, the necessity for the continued presence of our slave-repression squadron off the coast of Africa proves, alas! but too well that Christendom has not yet cleared itself from the foul guilt in which it so long revelled at the cost of the blood and tears of Africa. But it is not alone the remnant of the foreign slave-trade which proves that the old leaven which made men look upon Africans as a prey to be devoured, and not as wounded neighbours they were bound to succour, still exists in the European mind. The way in which we nationally grumble of late at the cost of the paltry little bottles of oil and wine that we are supposed to have been pouring into their wounds also proves it.

Hutton said that for years past the Manchester Chamber of Commerce had been in correspondence with the Colonial Office in reference to the West Coast of Africa, and had constantly called attention to the neglect of the authorities to attend to the interests of our trade, and to the responsibilities that ought to be undertaken in connexion with it. This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods. For that reason, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce felt greatly interested in this question, and they asked the Government to consider whether they could not accept a greater amount of responsibility, not only as regarded the merchants, but also as regarded the natives in the interior. This country held possession of a mere fringe of the coast; but the goods that passed up the river were taxed, and merchants got no protection for their trade in return. The policy of the Colonial Office deterred merchants from going into the interior, and disheartened them. They had been urged, and in fact warned, not to go into the interior. The result was that our trade had fallen off considerably. He considered that the cause of this decline was, in a great measure, the absence of that order and responsibility that ought to exist on the coast of Africa. Complaints had been made of internal wars. These wars were continually arising among the tribes, and in some cases merchants had been ruined. A substantial duty was levied on goods passing along the Gambia, and the protection accorded in return was most inadequate. The case of Gambia was, perhaps, the worst of the class. It had been troubled by wars and robberies to such an extent that trade was almost ruined, and there was scarcely a merchant left of any position. The trade of the district was gradually passing into the hands of the French, from the want of activity and determination on the part of the British authorities.

The Dutch and English Governments each occupied or claimed certain positions on and certain portions of the coast line between Apollonia and the River Volta. These positions and portions were not continuous and annexed, but were intermingled, Dutch with English. For many reasons this had long been considered as very unsatisfactory. The British Government, at least for the thirty-five years ending in 1865, had been by treaty and agreement the *protector* of all the countries between the before-mentioned points, and the sea and the line of the River Prah, against their old devastators and foes, the Ashantees. The Dutch, on the other hand, holding Elmina from the Ashantees, were allies of that power, and even so late as in the troubles of 1863 and 1864 supplied the Ashantees with munitions of war when they were in hostilities with the people of the British Protectorate. The British, throwing the shield of their power over the Territories, and making *some* exertions, however inadequate and unsatisfactory, for the advancement of Christian civilization and the development of resources, levied certain small *ad valorem* customs duties on imports; the Dutch, doing no such things, and holding their possessions merely for trade, and to enable them to obtain a few hundred slaves every year to ship to Java for military service there under the name of hired volunteers, levied no customs duties whatever, so that the whole charge for the Dutch establishments fell upon Holland, to the amount of about ten or twelve thousand pounds a-year. The real friends of progress on the Coast wished that the British Government should buy out the Dutch in the same way that they had some years ago bought out the Danes. But no hearty effort was ever made in this direction; the Dutch felt reluctant to sell because they wanted those 300 *recruits* every year for their Java forces, and so it was easily assumed they would not sell. An effort was then made, as the next best thing, to get them to impose customs duties upon a tariff to be agreed upon for both Dutch and English ports. This the Dutch refused most resolutely, unless Great Britain would consent to an exchange with them of certain points and positions before-mentioned, so that the Dutch might possess the whole coast line from Elmina to Apollonia, and the British the whole from Elmina on the other side to the River Volta, &c. It was well known that the Dutch coveted a sort of claim to the Wassaw countries, which are rich in gold, and which lie between their now coast line and Ashantee. The British Government, in virtue of their protectorate, had exercised at intervals a species of jurisdiction over all those interior countries, while the Dutch never had any claims or pretensions or exercised any jurisdiction whatever, except at and immediate to the several places they occupied or claimed on the Coast. To speak in general terms, the British were popular throughout all those countries until 1865, and the Dutch were very unpopular, notwithstanding their admission of goods duty free. When an exchange of territories, as it has been termed, was mooted, we stated our belief that this was impracticable, because, however willing the people at the points occupied and claimed by the Dutch might be to come under British jurisdiction, those who were under this would never consent to go under the Dutch, whom, as allies of the Ashantees, they looked upon as their enemies. We were told, however, by authorities, or supposed authorities, that this could all be arranged; and assuming this, as the British people would not advance to the Coast the money which was requisite for effecting some of that good which we so ardently desire, we were glad of a Dutch and British customs duty arrangement which would supply some of the funds indispensable for that object. When the treaty, to come into operation on the 1st of January, 1868, was ratified on the 5th of July last, it was but natural we should presume that the interval would be sedulously and earnestly employed by the representatives on the Coast of the so-called Christian Government of England to prepare the people really or nominally under them (if they were not already prepared) for the stipulated exchange. Could any reasonable man have supposed that, having to do, as they had to do in this case, with human beings, and not with mere chattels or things, they would leave all the duties of governors in so delicate a case entirely unfulfilled; and content themselves with notifying to the people concerned only a few days before the event was to take place, that they were to be transferred like so many cattle or pigs to a new owner? Could we or any sane man have supposed that they would in such a case as this have brought anew upon the British Government the heavy reproach, to which we alluded last month, that they seemed to consider their ""government existed only to collect revenue for the benefit of favoured officials;"" an additional proof of which the late Governor-General gave, even in the very act, it may be said, of taking over the new possessions, by beginning to apportion the increased revenues among the favoured crew? No; if we had hazarded such an assumption, we should have been vituperated as calumniators of virtuous, high-minded, and enlightened officials! as pestilent tribunes of the people striving to bring legitimate authority into contempt. Contempt, forsooth! why the whole British administration of the Coast has for some time past been beneath contempt; has been such as it could never have been had this long divinely-favoured country of Great Britain been caught in the toils of rationalistic infidelity on the one hand, and a besotted superstition on the other, which are hurrying her into that abyss where so many ruined nations already lie. And what has been the result of this most shameful abnegation of the duties of government for which and for previous *merits* Colonel Blackall has been inflicted on the British colonists of Queensland? This, that while there was a grumbling opposition, a more or less manifested determination against the Dutch rule everywhere, at British Commendah the exasperation of the people culminated; they would not in any way acknowledge Dutch masters, and declared this so unmistakably that the Dutch Commander, *in the presence of the British Administrator, who was there to hand over the place,* bombarded the village, destroyed not only it but the canoes, the means of livelihood of its people; and constrained them to take refuge, with their sick, their aged, and their little ones, in the wild bush behind, as stated in our last, and in our letters which we now publish. In this operation some of the poor people were killed—a woman seeking water', 'last_edit_date': '1868-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1868#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast Roads and the Dutch Settlements on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing the leader on ""Spurious Official Martyrs,"" motived by Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s letter in the *Times*, under the signature of ""Englishman,"" we had fully purposed not to allow this number of our journal to go to press without entering fully upon the discussion of the two above-mentioned subjects, which, in addition to the ""martyrdom,"" form the staple of that letter—viz., Cape Coast Roads, and Dutch obstinacy and selfishness in not giving up Elmina, &c., to the British authorities. We published in this paper a few months ago, Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s letter to the Secretary of State, in reply to one which we had addressed to the Colonial-office urging that there should be no further delay in commencing roads from Cape Coast, &c., to be carried forward eventually to the borders of Ashanti. In a subsequent number of our journal we examined the supposed argument of that letter of the Governor-in-Chief, and proved, we think, that the objections urged by him were puerile and unworthy. We regret that circumstances prevent our entering with equal fulness at this moment upon the consideration of his last effort in disproof of the possibility and utility of roads in the Gold Coast districts. It is too large and important a subject, and one which has been a theme with us for too many years, to allow us to limit our remarks so rigidly as we should be compelled to do, if we attempted to fulfil now the intention to which we have above alluded. We will, however, consider Sir Arthur Kennedy\'s new excuses, as well as re-consider, possibly, his old ones, in our next issue. Equally must we defer the observations we intended to make on the paragraphs in ""Englishman\'s"" letter, bearing on the projected cession of the Dutch possessions to Great Britain. We cannot, however, here defer remarking that it has become the fashion of late with Sir A. Kennedy and others to allude to the projected cession of the Dutch possessions as a benefit which *they* had prepared, and were about to bestow on the Gold Coast; and this is clearly again insinuated by ""Englishman"" in his letter, where he makes the Dutch withdrawal a sort of foundation-stone of some great policy of Mr. Usher\'s ""who has had the head to achieve what his heart had suggested to him should be brought about;"" but that ""his ability and his desire to follow out the dictates of a kindly disposition are paralysed by the obstinacy, the selfishness, and the proximity of the Dutch."" What is this but a sort of effort to attribute all the disgraceful failures of Mr. Usher\'s administration to his policy throughout having been frustrated by the Dutch, obstinately continuing to remain ""between the wind and his nobility""? The cession of the Dutch Settlements on the Gold Coast to Great Britain was conceived, urged, and ardently promoted by friends of Africa years ago—before there was any prospect of a governor-generalship for Sir Arthur Kennedy to administer, or a Mr. Usher was ever dreamed of as a possible administrator of the Gold Coast. With these brief remarks we reluctantly postpone all further consideration of these two important subjects until next month.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SOUTH AFRICAN AFFAIRS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The affairs of the Cape Colony and Natal do not appear to be in a very good way at present. This is to be regretted, as it is desirable that every one of our great colonial dependencies should enjoy a fair measure of prosperity, so as to afford outlets for the surplus capital and surplus labour of the mother country. The South African settlements possess one decided advantage over the Australian colonies—viz., their greater proximity to Europe and Great Britain. It is their comparative proximity to Europe which has so greatly assisted the development of the United States of America, since, in the first place, the United States have presented the most accessible emigration field for the surplus labour of the Old World, while, at the same time, the surplus produce of the United States has found a ready and tolerably well-assured market in Great Britain and Europe. It is, then, at first sight not a little strange that the South African settlements, which are only separated from London by a twenty-five days\' steaming, should have been left behind, as they certainly have been, by their Australian contemporaries. But several grave difficulties have, unfortunately, impeded the development of British South Africa. In the first place, although British authority has long been paramount in the Cape Colony, there are large Dutch and native elements in the population which have undoubtedly weakened the action of the authorities, and have frequently rendered the administration of the affairs of the province a matter of considerable difficulty. In the second place, Natal has not enjoyed for many years an independent existence as a colony, and the time which has elapsed for the development of her resources has still been comparatively limited. In the third place, the native tribes of South Africa are much more numerous and much more formidable than those of Australia. Here and there the white settlers in Australia have come into collision with the native inhabitants. But any isolated encounters which may have taken place have possessed scarcely any real significance, and have exerted no appreciable influence on the march of European civilization at the Antipodes. A far different state of things has prevailed in South Africa. There the native tribes have been numerous and formidable; and at a period quite recent, the future of Natal seemed trembling in the balance, the colony being threatened by the once redoubtable Cetewayo at the head of a host of disciplined warriors. In the fourth place, the difficulty of dealing with the native tribes of South Africa has been intensified by the presence of representatives of other European nations. As already observed, there is a large Dutch element in the Cape Colony, properly so called, while there are virtually separate Dutch communities in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, to say nothing of the Portuguese colony in the neighbourhood of Delagoa Bay. The existence of Dutch and Portuguese settlements side by side with what is ostensibly British South Africa tends to weaken British authority with the natives, and has also, probably, a certain adverse influence upon British authority in the Cape Colony and Natal. The Portuguese certainly do not count for very much in South Africa; but the same can scarcely be said of the Dutch element, which is undoubtedly powerful, and grudges the English every atom of the influence which they have acquired in regions over which the Dutch once had exclusive sway. The fifth difficulty is probably to be found in the fact that when the Dutch were masters of South Africa they treated the native tribes with more or less cruelty, the result being that the native races have never altogether overcome the suspicion with which they regard their white neighbours, whether Dutch or English. A sixth difficulty is the broken character of the soil of South Africa, the country being what the French term very ""tormented,"" communication from one point to another being thus impeded. The difficulties which we have enumerated will probably yet yield to English perseverance and English fortitude, if that perseverance and fortitude are accompanied by the equally indispensable qualities of moderation and good sense. It should be observed that the English authorities in South Africa are steadily pressing forward with the construction of railways, by which means, no doubt, the hold of the Government upon the remoter parts of the colony will be materially strengthened, while the movement of population and commodities will also be greatly facilitated.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DUTCH AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""My Lord,—I beg leave to draw your lordship's attention to important and pressing matters connected with Her Majesty's Settlements on the Gold Coast. Since the publication of the report of the Committee of the House of Commons I have regarded the relinquishment by Great Britain of the settlement on the Gold Coast as only a matter of time. Although, both on national and Christian grounds, I dissent from the policy which dictates such a measure, and believe it greatly erroneous, still, as I have no hope of seeing it reversed, I frankly adopt it. Devoted to the cause of African material development as the means toward higher and nobler ulterior results, I am most anxious that such relinquishment shall not be made until the people shall be fitted for self-government; and that all practical measures shall be adopted for hastening the period at which the desire expressed by the Parliamentary Committee can be accomplished, under such circumstances that the progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Gold Coast territories shall not be prejudiced, nor England dishonoured by the act. Now England never can leave her settlements on the Gold Coast while the Netherlands retains hers. It would be an act leading inevitably to such horrible results as to call down upon England the just reprobation of the whole civilised world. The feelings with which the Dutch are regarded everywhere, except within Elmina and one or two other small towns, and the intimate alliance between the Dutch and Ashantees, would render any better class of results impossible. The Dutch have been a curse to the Gold Coast, and the good intentions of Her Majesty's Government toward it must continually be frustrated while they remain there. Acting on this conviction, which was justified by then passing events, I urged, long before the sitting of the said Parliamentary Committee, that Her Majesty's Government should buy out the Dutch. The Dutch did not then levy any duties, consequently had no revenue, and their occupation entailed a dead loss of about 12,000l. a-year, greatly to the displeasure of many members of the Dutch Legislature. The only recompense of the Dutch was in their power of obtaining 300 or 400 slaves yearly from their Ashantee allies, under the name of volunteers, to reinforce their troops in Java. But this might have been overcome had Her Majesty's Government seriously endeavoured to overcome it. Circumstances have since changed. The African recruits for Java are, I believe, no longer deemed to be indispensable; but under the Exchange of Territories Treaty between Great Britain and the Netherlands the Dutch are now levying duties, which last year are estimated to have yielded 6,000l., and would have yielded 30,000l., could the treaty have been peacefully carried out. Owing, however, to faults inherent to the Treaty itself, and further to the wrong and injudicious measures adopted in the exchange, a state of hostility has resulted between the Dutch authorities and the Fantee tribes, which has been aggravated and irremediably envenomed by the atrocities committed by the Ashantees acting in alliance with the Dutch, and thus fully justifying the fears, suspicions, and determination of the Fantees as regards the supposed rights conferred on the Dutch under the said treaty; so that while the Dutch have only obtained some 6,000l. revenue, the measures they have been compelled to adopt to maintain their position on the coast have probably cost 60,000l.; and this only to increase their future difficulties there."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-04-19', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1871#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Congo Traders and their Grievances', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is extracted from a letter received from a Liverpool gentleman who has had many years\' experience of trading on the Congo: ""If the various Governments interested can only be moved to look into the question of duties, it is difficult to see how they will be able to sanction such an enormous amount of squeezing out of the few traders who by fair promises were induced to establish in the Free State territory and the traders established in the Lower Congo long before the Free State was ever dreamed of, and who have not benefited in any way from it. From the poverty-stricken condition of the Free State Government, and for political reasons, I fear the duties will not be arranged in anything like a satisfactory manner for the traders, and if the French and Portuguese Governments follow suit, there is no saying where the thing will end; but of this we are certain, a great blow will be given to English enterprise, and we know that neither French nor Portuguese capitalists will put money in these colonies. Belgian capital is out of the question altogether; the Free State seems to be regarded as a hobby or a speculation of the King. How long will it take to open up the Dark Continent to the boasted advantages of civilisation if the pioneers are to be hampered and hindered by the Governments who ought to help them to the utmost?""\n\nIt may be asked why Holland should especially bestir itself in Congo matters more than other nations? The reason is that the Dutch joint-stock company, De Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels Vennootschap, exports seven-eighths of the total produce of the Congo; its shares are in the hands of numerous holders; it is one of the oldest European establishments in that region, and has a character, an organisation, and a prospect higher than it ever previously possessed.\n\nThe duty which Holland is striving to fulfil with respect to her African Trading Company has its counterpart in England. We Englishmen have also compatriots whose history has been similar to that of the Dutch company. Though not possessing such an extensive interest, their establishments are spread over the territory claimed by the Portuguese and the French. These Powers may follow suit if the present encroachments be not resisted, and it behoves our Government to see that our merchants do not suffer through the proposed innovations. But Governments will not, cannot, act unless moved from outside, and the traders of the Congo district thoroughly realise this fact. The export houses have all decided to urge the Powers to ameliorate the present condition of affairs, with a unanimity born of common danger.—R. C.

The exports from the Dutch East Indies amount to some £18,000,000. Most of this goes to the mother country. Holland sends annually to her East Indian colonies goods to the value of £5,000,000. Notwithstanding the larger population of Belgium, her trade is only about one-half of that of the Netherlands. According to the latest statistics the annual value of the exports from the Congo State is £250,000. Suppose this all went to Belgium for home consumption, it would not form more than one-half per cent. of the total imports into Belgium. The total imports into the Congo Free State amount to about £360,000 per annum; but of this less than half is of Belgian origin, Great Britain contributing about £100,000. More than half the exports consist of ivory—a product which is bound rapidly to decrease; caoutchouc, palm oil, and palm nuts form the bulk of the remainder, all of them natural products. The exports of rice and maize, cultivated products, are insignificant. The value of the commerce of the Congo State is about one-sixth of that of our West African colonies, which are little more than patches on the coast.\n\nStill, when the difficulties with which the Congo State has had to struggle are taken into account, its commerce might be regarded as in a hopeful position. And here again the Blue-book refers to the Dutch East Indies and to the value of their sugar, coffee, and other cultivated products; the suggestion being that the centre of tropical Africa might be developed on the same scale as the island colonies of the Netherlands. But the physical characteristics, the climate, the population, the accessibility of the Dutch East Indies, can hardly be compared with those of the Congo State. Quite as marked is the distinction between the native population\n**59**\n\n---\n\nof the Congo and that of Java and Sumatra. The natives of the Congo are not deficient in intelligence; but those of the Dutch East Indies, are, and were, civilized compared with the savages with whom the Belgian officials and traders have to deal. A system of compulsion closely akin to slavery would be necessary before the natives of the Congo State could be trained to regular voluntary labour, unless the administration were prepared to await the results accruing from missionary effort. To develop the territories of the Free State native labour is absolutely necessary. The Dutch East Indies have not only a large native population, but in India and China have command of vast labour markets. Over 600 Chinese coolies were introduced some years ago on the Congo railway.
