328,"Frequent and devastating fires in colonial African cities like Lagos and Sierra Leone during the 19th century underscore the inadequacy of urban planning, infrastructure, and emergency response systems, exacerbated by natural conditions and potential arson, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety regulations and preventive measures.","The claim that frequent and devastating fires in colonial African cities like Lagos and Sierra Leone during the 19th century underscore the inadequacy of urban planning, infrastructure, and emergency response systems is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The textbook discusses urban planning and infrastructure in colonial African cities, noting the replication of European urban designs, which often led to depersonalization and alienation of the African population. However, it does not mention fires, emergency response systems, or challenges posed by natural conditions or arson, focusing instead on the broader impacts of colonial urban planning. In contrast, The African Times provides substantial evidence supporting the claim, detailing numerous fires in Lagos exacerbated by dry Harmattan winds and the use of highly combustible materials like thatched roofs. The articles highlight the lack of fire engines and the inefficiency of existing ones, with calls for improved fire prevention measures and infrastructure, such as fireproof buildings and a government magazine for gunpowder storage. Instances of potential arson and the role of natural conditions in exacerbating fires are also noted. However, the articles do not specifically mention Sierra Leone, focusing more on Lagos, which is a notable difference from the claim. Together, these observations highlight the urgent need for improved safety regulations and preventive measures in colonial African cities, as emphasized by The African Times, while the textbook provides context on the broader urban planning issues without directly addressing the fire-related challenges.","The provided paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook do not directly address the claim regarding frequent and devastating fires in colonial African cities like Lagos and Sierra Leone during the 19th century. The text does discuss urban planning and infrastructure, noting that cities were often developed as replicas or adaptations of European urban planning, which could lead to depersonalization and alienation of the African population. However, it does not mention fires, emergency response systems, or the specific challenges posed by natural conditions or arson. The focus is more on the broader impacts of colonial urban planning and the introduction of European methods in African cities. This absence of information on fires and emergency response systems highlights a significant difference between the claim and the content of the textbook, suggesting that the claim may not be directly supported by the textbook's narrative.","The African Times news articles provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that frequent and devastating fires in colonial African cities like Lagos and Sierra Leone during the 19th century highlighted the inadequacy of urban planning, infrastructure, and emergency response systems.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades. African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought.

What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': ""A number of African societies also expanded their defensive capabilities through internal military innovations.

Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially.

Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

As J. L. Vellut has emphasized, the nineteenth century was not just 'the history of the ebb and flow of the world economy as experienced by ... Africa', but also 'the slow-moving ... history of diversification in making use of natural resources.'$^{20}$ It is essential to emphasize this internal factor on which the external came to impinge and which shaped the response of African peoples to the external factors. As Cohen has shown in his chapter on the Great Lakes region hitherto studied only as a collection of centralized states responding to external forces - 'the nineteenth century was not simply a world of states, large and small. It was also a world in which individuals and households were in innumerable small, sometimes undramatic ways, altering their orientations to state authority, to service, to production, and to the market.' 21 The agricultural system around the ancient city of Kano in northern Nigeria at the beginning of the nineteenth century provides interesting similarities and contrasts with the world of Bunafu in the 'unadministered zone' of northern Busoga. For one thing, the market played a stronger role in the economy, since Kano was a well-established centre of local, regional and international trade based in part on major and highly successful industrial activity in the manufacture, dyeing and distribution of textiles, and the tanning of leather. Yet it would be misleading to concentrate on the channel effects of the markets and trade routes and to ignore the network of social and cultural relations on which the markets and the trade routes depended. Similarly, in Kano, there was the influence of Islam, and the much greater role of the ruler and the ruling class and merchants of the walled city in the management of the economy. And yet in Kano, as in Bunafu and the village communities of Tunisia, the bulk of agricultural production not only of basic essentials but also of a variety of cottons and dyes was in the hands of commoners in the rural areas among whom the household was the unit of production. As Abdulahi Mahadi has observed in a recent study, the head of a household in the Kano area, the maigida, was 'like a ruler of a town'.

Exorbi› tant taxes (increasing in ten years from B.frs 1.25 to B.frs 7) encouraged the population to flee to the Gold Coast instead of raising crops. Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.591, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""The peasants also developed a number of techniques to avoid or minimize the discomforts of forced labour.

Thus, I am left to conclude that the great reluctance which almost all of them exhibit towards work has been the sole cause of their fleeing the services in question.' 41 Other disgruntled workers sabotaged agricultural equipment, burned warehouses and robbed stores belonging to the concessionary companies and local traders, and destroyed transportation and communication lines."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system. These various strategies and measures proved on the whole unsuccessful, and by the end of the period under review, colonialism had become firmly entrenched in the whole of West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'And as will be seen in many of the following chapters, religion was indeed one of the weapons used against colonialism. Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out.

It appears from his letter that the authorities have already decided on certain improvements as regards streets and buildings, as well as police regulations, that will diminish the probability of similar fires in future. This was absolutely necessary. Lagos is becoming a place of considerable trade. Our merchants' stores there are generally filled with valuable goods and produce. To insure these is out of the question; and every possible precaution ought to be insisted on by the Governor and Council to diminish the mercantile risk. Some of our friends have, we regret to say, had storehouses destroyed in the late conflagrations; but happily, the losses sustained by them, though vexatious, are not of a serious nature, all the principal stores having escaped; and if the proper measures be now adopted, as a consequence of these fires, the losses sustained in them will not be regretted.\n\nWe hope and believe that everything possible will be done for the embellishment as well as the security of Lagos. But as we find no allusion to it in our correspondent's letter, there is one thing that we desire to urge most earnestly upon the authorities here and at Lagos—that is, the formation of a Government magazine or powder depot at Lagos, where all the merchants may, and shall be compelled to deposit their powder, paying a certain rent to the Government. Without this there can be no real security. Gunpowder is largely imported. It has been, and still is, lying about in stores and outhouses in all directions. The danger of such a course is obvious. It might have done very well when Lagos was nothing but an agglomeration of barbarian huts. But now that it is rising in wealth and importance—now that some of the merchants' stores contain many thousand pounds worth of produce—now that it is a seat of British authority—so improvident a system ought not to be tolerated. We beg to press upon the authorities at home and in the colony the absolute necessity of immediate action in this matter.

The fire passed over Shokore, a rapid stream in wet weather, but now dry, and ignited the extensive premises of Mr. Ribeiro, Madam Tinabu, Mr. Savage, and that of the West\n\nAfrican Company. The iron house of the West African Company was no protection; by some means the property stored inside caught fire and was entirely consumed. The large hydraulic cotton press of the West African Company, just completed, was destroyed, together with their oil and cotton. A quantity of oil belonging to Capt. Davies and Mr. H. Robbin was saved, from being stored at some little distance off and in the open air. Among the Sierra-Leone people who suffered were Mr. Savage, who is said to have lost 30,000 gallons of oil, Mr. Peter Rae 9,300 gallons of oil, Mr. Jas.

A railroad has been projected at Cape Coast Town, and such an undertaking, if consisting of a single line of rails only, either along the coast or towards the interior, would do much to abase barbaric power in Ashanti and Dahomi. The traffic in spirits, so fraught with evil to natives everywhere, ought to be forbidden by Act of the Imperial Parliament, the cargo to be seized and destroyed, and the owners subjected to a heavy fine. And is it not time for the construction of docks at practicable spots, and for taking precautions against the recurrence of the fires which devastate Freetown and Lagos so frequently? As there are few masons, carpenters, wheelwrights, and painters to be found on the coast, ought not an industrial school to be added to the existing educational establishments for the purpose of teaching those trades? These enterprises, pretentious as they may seem when proposed in connexion with communities so young in civilization as the West African negro settlements, are nevertheless certainly feasible, if the educated Africans will only put their own shoulders to the wheel.

With the exception of a new brick mercantile store—which was gutted, the wall remaining uninjured—all the buildings were constructed of the most inflammable materials, the roofs being of thatch, so dry, that a spark sufficed to set any one of them on fire. The second conflagration burnt out a good square mile of Lagos huts and houses in little more than an hour's time. We were now thoroughly aroused to the necessity of taking precautions for the future. I believe it will be so arranged that the merchants' stores will range along the quay, and be isolated from all native habitations. This seems to be indispensable to the prosperity of the town, because no insurance could be effected on property in this place except at rates that would more than eat up all mercantile profits. It has been already decided by the Legislative Council that no houses built henceforth shall be thatched; they must be covered with a less combustible material; and within a certain reasonable time the thatch must also be removed from all dwellings and other buildings now covered by it. That good will eventually result from these disasters there can be no doubt; only it is greatly to be deplored that no compensation can be given to those who have suffered. It is to be hoped that the Governor and Council will lay down a systematic plan for the re-construction of the place; providing for good and open roads and streets, intersecting each other at right angles.

A recent strike of the police force was caused by an endeavour being made to compel the police to perform fire brigade duty in addition to their ordinary avocation. Recently, on a fire occurring in the Hausa quarters, great difficulty was experienced in getting the engine out of the Custom House building, and in the interval no fewer than thirty-six houses were burned down. It was then decided to remove the fire engine to the public works, where it could be got at any moment. The authorities also considered that the police ought to perform the fire brigade duty, and for this they agreed to give them extra pay in the shape of overtime. The police objected to the overtime, and as the result refused to perform duty. There was no alternative but to get them arrested by the Hausas. After imprisoning the ringleaders, an arrangement was come to by which the police are to act as a reserve fire brigade. Fifteen men are detailed weekly for the duty, to be succeeded the following week by fifteen others. The fact, however, of the police objecting to obey orders gave the authorities the impression that they could not be relied upon, and on this account the desire for the return of the 300 Hausas sent down to the Gold Coast from Lagos was expressed.—The work of constructing the new railway was stopped when the Loanda passed. This was on account of the rains, but there had also been a number of deaths. It is said that the line is costing more than had been anticipated, and that the money voted for the construction was nearly exhausted, although not much more than one-tenth of the work had been completed. Mr. W. Shalford, M.Inst. C.E., consulting engineer to the Colonial Office for West African Railways, states with regard to the railway being constructed at Lagos: (1) The construction has never been stopped, but during the wet season the rate of construction has necessarily been below the average. (2) During the rainy season, also, there has been the usual increase of sickness, but no death has occurred on the railway staff during the last year and a-half. (3) So far from the line costing more than had been anticipated, it is now certain that the work already constructed has been carried out within the estimate. (4) About one-third of the authorised length has been so far completed that locomotives drawing construction trains are running over it.""

W. Rowland on the sanitary condition of that island. Mr. Rowland says: ""The island is alluvial, and, being in the tropics, could not be otherwise than malarious. The level of the ground water never retires far from the surface. In the driest season it is in some wells not six feet deep; in Olowogbowo, the most elevated part of the island, at this season water is found at a depth of twenty-one feet, and the average depth, as found by the measurement of Government wells erected only in the more elevated quarters, is thirteen feet. In the rains the water is close to the surface—in some places, indeed, above it. This is very favourable for the production of malaria. There was a large mortality amongst the European population in the town. This points out the urgency for sanitary works, as most of the deaths were due to malaria. The prevention, or at least the mitigation, of this evil should be the first subject to which attention is paid. That it is possible to eradicate malaria from its most favoured haunts has been repeatedly proved. To find a remedy it must first be known what are the conditions necessary and most favourable to its development. It is not necessary to know the nature of the malarial poison if its production can be prevented, or at least curtailed: the two chief conditions are subsoil moisture and a high temperature. It is in the tropics that these conditions predominate. To combat them it is necessary to drain the subsoil and lower the temperature of the surface. Nature supplies in vegetation a simple means of attaining these ends. Pittenkofer has calculated that an oak-tree which had 751,592 leaves had from May to October an evaporation equal to 212 inches, whilst the rainfall over an area equal to that covered by the tree was only 25.6 inches, so that the evaporation was 8.3 times the rainfall. The eucalyptus in Algeria has been calculated to evaporate twelve times the rainfall. The water for evaporation is supplied from the subsoil by the roots, which penetrate in all directions. Whilst getting rid of the water from the soil, the evaporation cools the air, and the shade afforded by the trees protects the soil from the direct rays of the sun. If we acknowledge the influence of high temperature in producing malaria, the great advantage to be gained by sheltering the soil from the direct rays of the sun is evident, when we consider that when the temperature in the shade is 80°, in exposed parts it is nearly double. As a sandy soil has twice the capacity for retaining heat as humus, the disadvantage of having large unshaded sandy plains in the neighbourhood is evident. Such plains are hotbeds of malaria. These plains arise from the destruction of the forests, which is brought about partly for the purpose of supplying fuel, but mainly in order to clear the land for cultivation. The virgin soil, never particularly rich, is capable of producing crops for four or five years. The land is then deserted, and becomes overgrown with grass, which, being periodically burnt, prevents the re-growth of the forest. The exposed soil is impoverished by the heavy rainfall carrying away all the organic matter, so that further cultivation is impossible. This is notably the case about Accra, where the open plains radiate for about ten or twelve miles from the town. As a sanitary measure, it is suggested that the planting of quick-growing and shade-producing trees in the open spaces, in the compounds of houses, and the streets, should be proceeded with at once. All the streets should be shaded with trees, which should be planted so as to give the maximum shade with the minimum interference with the circulation of air. The eucalyptus has been largely used for this purpose, but it does not thrive in Lagos, owing, I think, to the poor sandy soil. One planted in the hospital compound in 1882 is now covered with flower buds, but the tree has not gained its reputed dimensions. There are many local trees that would answer our purpose better.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NIGER COAST PROTECTORATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the beginning of the present year the town of Bonny was in a dirty and unsanitary condition.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation.

But the disruption in the normal flow of caliphal trade caused for example by Ningi and Mbutawa raids was serious enough to require a remedy. Indeed their own experience of severe food shortages and the interruption of the grain trade during the djifiàd had made men like Muhammad Bello acutely aware of the importance of encouraging traders by keeping roads open, establishing markets and enforcing the laws regulating fair trading. In consequence, as the caliphal economy became relatively more efficient and neighbouring peoples depended more heavily on caliphal trade and traders, economic policy was increasingly a more effective instrument of power than warfare.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

It appears from his letter that the authorities have already decided on certain improvements as regards streets and buildings, as well as police regulations, that will diminish the probability of similar fires in future. This was absolutely necessary. Lagos is becoming a place of considerable trade. Our merchants' stores there are generally filled with valuable goods and produce. To insure these is out of the question; and every possible precaution ought to be insisted on by the Governor and Council to diminish the mercantile risk. Some of our friends have, we regret to say, had storehouses destroyed in the late conflagrations; but happily, the losses sustained by them, though vexatious, are not of a serious nature, all the principal stores having escaped; and if the proper measures be now adopted, as a consequence of these fires, the losses sustained in them will not be regretted.\n\nWe hope and believe that everything possible will be done for the embellishment as well as the security of Lagos. But as we find no allusion to it in our correspondent's letter, there is one thing that we desire to urge most earnestly upon the authorities here and at Lagos—that is, the formation of a Government magazine or powder depot at Lagos, where all the merchants may, and shall be compelled to deposit their powder, paying a certain rent to the Government. Without this there can be no real security. Gunpowder is largely imported. It has been, and still is, lying about in stores and outhouses in all directions. The danger of such a course is obvious. It might have done very well when Lagos was nothing but an agglomeration of barbarian huts. But now that it is rising in wealth and importance—now that some of the merchants' stores contain many thousand pounds worth of produce—now that it is a seat of British authority—so improvident a system ought not to be tolerated. We beg to press upon the authorities at home and in the colony the absolute necessity of immediate action in this matter.

The affair arose, it is stated, through the agent of the Dutch factory at Muculla employing Krooboys to perform the labouring duties in connection with the establishment. The king of the place requested the Dutch authorities to discharge the men, but the agent would not, saying he had a perfect right to employ whom he pleased. A few days afterwards the natives sought the intervention of the other European traders to have the Krooboys withdrawn. The natives invited the whites to the town to hold a meeting, but the latter refused to interfere. In less than three hours afterwards a force of from 700 to 800 natives arrived, with flint-lock guns, spears, and other weapons, and marched in a body to attack the factory. The agent had collected his Kroomen to the number of over 100, and armed them with Snider rifles in anticipation of an attack. He had also four 16-pounder guns which were put into position. The white assistants were armed with Martini rifles. For some time a brisk fire was exchanged, many of the natives taking shelter behind a powder magazine situated about 400 yards from the factory. At one time the natives threatened to take the place by storm, owing to their overwhelming numbers. Fearing this, and the consequent massacre of the small defending party, the magazine was fired into. A fearful explosion followed, killing all the natives who were near and destroying much property. It was said that thirty natives were firing from behind the magazine when the explosion took place, and all of them were killed. It was said the magazine contained over 25,000 lbs. of powder at the time. The factory to which the magazine belonged was completely destroyed, the débris falling around the Europeans who were endeavouring to save the place. Notwithstanding this disaster, the natives continued to fight for several hours, but eventually withdrew, leaving about forty dead behind. So great was the explosion that the report was heard at Ambrizette, seventeen miles distant. The battle was fought on Dec. 17, and on the 24th the Portuguese corvette, Rainha de Portugal, arrived, when a consultation took place between the commander and the traders. It was decided that the king of the place, together with four of his headmen, should be detained as a security against any further disturbance, and if the demand was not complied with, force would be used. A reply to the request was to be received on Jan. 4, and in the event of the king and the other hostages not being forthcoming, an expedition was to be sent up on the 7th. In the meantime a force of fifty marines and 200 Kroomen was made ready for the forthcoming war, in case of the ultimatum being refused, and the Dutch gunboat Tromp received orders to sail at once for San Paolo de Loanda. There is thus every chance of a lively little campaign between the merchants and the Dutch and Portuguese marines, assisted by the unpatriotic Kroomen, on the one hand, and the King with his black warriors on the other.'}, {'id': 6794, 'article_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'full_section_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-2', 'issue_date': '04_01_1897', 'content': ""The British & African Company's steamer Lagos, which arrived at Liverpool on Dec. 10 with mails and passengers from the West Coast, brought sad news from Grand Lahou.

The latter had been on an expedition up country against some interior Natives who were stopping trade. They had only been away two days, but during that time they burned nine native towns. The king of the chief town was said to have been killed by the Liberians. On the side of the latter one man was wounded. Senator Green, who is also a trader and resides at Sinoe, was said to be opposed to the despatch of the expedition.

This is the second event of the kind which has happened within a very brief period, though in the previous case the loss of life was very much less. Particulars of the catastrophe have reached Liverpool, from which it appears that a train travelling from Emposi to Matadi with a number of Europeans and Natives in it collided with a waggon containing fifty-four boxes of dynamite and eighty-two barrels of gunpowder, which was to have been attached to the rear part of the train. A fearful explosion followed. The report was heard down at Matadi, and for many miles along the banks of the river. The car with the explosives had disappeared, and in its place was a huge excavation like a ravine, the rails of the line being twisted into all shapes. The engine itself was turned completely round and destroyed, while piled on top of it were the carriages containing most of the passengers.

The British & African Steam Navigation steamer Lualaba was also lying at Matadi, and Captain Murray with his officers and the ship’s doctor, hastened to the scene of the catastrophe. The only doctor of the place was in the train, and he was seriously injured. The surgeon of the British steamer rendered all assistance in his power, and the wounded and the dying were carried to a temporary hospital. Three of the white officials were killed outright, whilst a fourth—M. Legene, the head of the Société Anonyme Belge—succumbed to his injuries on the following day.

It is also stated here that even when a subordinate officer pointed out officially, on two different occasions, the very unsafe condition of the locks of the Magazine, no steps whatever were taken by the Assistant-Collector either to change the locks or report the matter to the authorities.\n\nShould such amount of culpability really lie at the Collector's door, we trust the authorities here will never think of recommending, nor Lord Carnarvon sanction, that the colony be burdened with the payment of nearly 400l., the value of the said gunpowder (an actual waste of money at a time when the Government is greatly in need of a considerable sum for the erection of public buildings), but that the Assistant-Collector and Treasurer be held liable for the same; a course usually adopted with officers in similar cases, in order to impress them with the fact of their responsibility.\n\nMany instances are given us to indicate that the present state of affairs in the Assistant-Collector's department is most deplorable, but we will only give two out of those we have by us.\n\n1.

But, for no reasons whatever that we can understand, the present Collector, in framing the estimates for 1876, at the time he performed the duties of Assistant Colonial Secretary in conjunction with the duties of his own office, reduced the salary from 100l. to 50l. per annum—an amount which was afterwards found too inadequate to retain the services of a trustworthy officer; and, at the appointment of the clerk in whose time the gunpowder was robbed, the Assistant-Collector failed to call upon that officer to execute the usual bond; we can only suppose because he felt himself not justified in doing so under such a reduced rate of salary.

M. Stanley draws an important deduction from the report of recent fighting between the forces of the Congo State and the slave-traders. First he calls to mind the provisions of Article X of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, which stated that Governments exercising rights of sovereignty in Africa should do their utmost to prevent the exit or entry of fire-arms by their inland frontiers, or their passage to regions where the slave-trade is rife. Next from his own knowledge he remarks upon ""the extravagant waste of ammunition in the slave-traders\' camps"" and then asks how it is that these same slave-traders, who ""for the last three years have been blazing away as though they possessed exhaustless supplies of gunpowder"" could still be so well provided with ammunition as to be able to keep up a heavy fire for several hours upon the Congo State forces. Putting two and two together, the conclusion at which he arrives is that one of the three Governments—Great Britain, Germany, and Portugal—must, in defiance of Article X., have been conniving at the importation of these fire-arms and this ammunition. If this be so, it is easy to see that the march of civilisation in the Dark Continent must be very seriously impeded. Every Government, in fact, can, by winking at the behaviour of its own subjects, very seriously interfere with the well-being of the territories of the other Governments. Unfortunately, it is easier to state the conclusion than to suggest the remedy. England may be able to answer for her subjects, though, considering the difficulties of African administration, it would not be surprising if sometimes she failed to keep all the sheep in check; at any rate, she cannot control the subjects of Germany and Portugal. It is much to be feared that so long as the slave-traders have the commodities wherewith to pay for arms and ammunition there will be found unscrupulous Europeans ready to smuggle them.', 'last_edit_date': '1893-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1893#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Anti-Slavery Conference', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONFERENCE.\n(Concluded from page 101.)\n\n**CHAPTER I.**, on the distribution of the work of the Conference, included a wide range of subjects summed up as measures for the repression of the land traffic—that is to say, for stopping the slave-trade at its starting-point. Most of these appear to be rather in the nature of rules for homogeneous action which each State undertakes to carry out to the best of its ability than in that of international engagements. But there is, however, one subject in this chapter which is of paramount importance—viz., the traffic in firearms.\n\nSome idea of the importance of this question may be gathered from the fact that into Zanzibar alone some 80,000 to 100,000 muskets and rifles are imported annually. Firearms are bartered to Arab traders on the coast for ivory and other inland products, a large proportion of them being the disused rifles of present European standing armies. The object of the provisions of the Brussels Conference on this subject is to protect the negro against his Arab enemy and captor by disarming the latter.\n\nThe principle of preserving the native African races was inserted in the General Act of Berlin, by which “the Powers undertake to watch over the preservation of the native races and the improvement of their moral and material conditions.” There was, therefore, no question of principle to discuss. Nor was there any doubt as to interference with the traffic in firearms being indispensable. The difficulties lay in determining the extent to which this interference should be carried, so as to avoid any unnecessary interference with great trading interests and practical disarmament of those who need the arms for their own defence, and to take such measures as would leave no loopholes for the trade to be carried on by different channels.\n\nThere were several courses possible. It had to be decided whether the trade throughout Africa should be regulated, or whether the regulations should be confined to the affected district. And also whether the regulations should take the form of prohibition altogether, or be framed on lines of restriction with distinctions.\n\nThe French Government made a strong stand in favour of entire prohibition throughout Africa; but the view taken by the Governments of Great Britain, Holland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy was opposed to so radical a step, as going beyond the purpose of preserving the native races and as implying the needless sacrifice of a large mercantile interest without local justification. The Conference came ultimately to the same conclusion. The next question was to determine the area within which the importation of firearms was to be regulated. This zone is believed to extend from 20 degs. of north latitude to 22 degs. of south latitude, from coast to coast across the African Continent between these lines, as well as to 100 marine miles seawards.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Defenceless State of the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""To the Right Hon.

By means of the railway the State could at once transport about a dozen iron stations; and there would soon be erected houses, churches, and schools, all of iron. Then the native chiefs, seeing what the Europeans were doing, would build iron houses, and would likewise require iron warehouses for their goods. The Chief of Kintamo, for instance, already keeps all his goods in iron boxes; while the Chiefs of Old Calabar live in iron houses which have cost from £1,000 to £3,500 each. Then, again, there would be many steamers to be transported in sections, to be put together on the upper side of the cataracts. On the Upper Congo there are at present only seven steamers, mostly steam launches, but to carry on the enormous trade of the 7,000 miles of navigable waterway of the Upper Congo, large and swift steamers will be required, capable of stowing cargo and carrying passengers in comfort. Again, there would be a large trade in timber, and saw-mills would be required to cut it up, which mills would have to be taken up country by railway. Enormous quantities of powder and large numbers of flint-lock guns would also be in demand. All this is without counting the almost limitless trade to be done in cloth goods. I should say that within a reasonable number of years after the making of the railway there would be a trade of about £10,000,000 annually with the natives of the Upper Congo—all in barter.""\n\nPausing here, Mr. Stanley went on to say that there was a sentimental side to the whole question which was worthy of reflection.

When the State can better afford it—which will be not long after the railway is finished—it will be able to enlist 3,000 or 4,000 native soldiers for the protection of the country against the slave-traders.

The intelligence to hand is to the effect that one firm, amongst others, had been ordered to discontinue the sale of percussion guns in the territory of the new State. The instructions were issued by Major Parminter. No previous notice had been given, and the agent of the firm was in a dilemma as to what he should do with the guns he had in stock and on their way, amounting to about 3,000. The agent protested against this interference, as the same kind of guns had been imported and sold by him for some time past, and the action of the Congo Free State authorities was, therefore, beyond comprehension. The head of the State, Sir Francis de Winton, was absent from Banana at the time, but on his return he confirmed the action of Major Parminter, and subsequently issued a notice prohibiting the sale of percussion guns and ammunition in the Congo State. Meantime the Portuguese on the opposite side of the river permit the free sale of the same articles. Mr. Stanley appears to consider that this prohibition had been issued in error. It is said that no offer of compensation has been made to the traders for the loss they will sustain if the restriction remains in force. In the case of the British Government putting a similar order in operation during the Zulu war without due notice, compensation was allowed for the loss entailed. The English merchants supported the claims of the Congo Free State at the Berlin Conference, believing that their operations would not be hampered by unwise restrictions. It is therefore said that this last act, which is so contrary to the unrestricted freedom which Mr. Stanley spoke about when decrying the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty, will not tend to increase the friendly feelings of the merchants towards it. Later advice shows that the order which has been issued formally prohibiting the sale of the guns and ammunition imposes a penalty of £1,000 for any breach of the regulations. It is, however, looked upon as absurd to suppose that the order in question will prevent the guns gaining admission to the territory of the State, as the Portuguese allow unrestricted sale of the same articles on the opposite side of the river, and the natives can easily carry them across in their canoes.

A few minutes afterwards, Captain Keene, of the Benin, perceived flag signals displayed from the gunboats, which he understood to convey the order that he was not to communicate with the shore. Since the Benin had anchored no passengers had come out from either Rocktown or Cape Palmas, two ports about two miles apart, but a number of Krooboys, who were out in fishing and other canoes, boarded the mail steamer.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

It is reported that there had not been such continuous heavy rains for the last thirty years. In a letter received by us per Biafra, 3rd instant, the writer tells us that it had then been raining heavily during thirty days, with never more than a couple of hours\' intermission. We can imagine what the reeking atmosphere of that disgracefully filthy place must have been, with all the fetid exhalations confined within it, during so long a period. Our only surprise is, not that there are so many deaths at such a time, but that so many persons survive. Year after year, we have been urging on the British authorities there to adopt some sufficient measures for the purification of the place. The old plea for not doing this was ""want of funds."" That plea can no longer be urged. Authorities that can afford to throw away some 6,000l. in a single year for such a disgracefully worthless toy as the condemned steam yacht, Nellie, cannot with any show of reason say they have no money with which to effect that first of all necessary reforms in such a climate—viz., the removing of some of the many sources of that fatal atmospheric impurity which has from time to time destroyed so much human life at Cape Coast. It is not for us, who are not on the spot, to point out what those measures should be. With miles upon miles of bush and forest surrounding the town, there is all that is wanting for a cheap and almost illimitable supply of charcoal, by the regulated and compulsory employment of which Cape Coast might be at least freed from the odious and most fatal exhalations of putrifying animal excreta. We do not hesitate to say that a comparatively cheap system of atmospheric purification might be found, if the important question be diligently studied by the authorities. And surely, it ought to be felt by them to be not only a matter of public duty, but one intimately, most intimately, connected with their own personal safety and well-being. We do not estimate lightly the difficulties with which they would have to contend, with a resident uncivilized population, and many uncivilized native strangers continually resorting to the town. But all these difficulties would be speedily overcome, and cheaply too, by a real sanitary reformer. The insalubrity of the African Coast towns arises from the constant accumulation of poisonous gases in their atmosphere, thrown into it by decaying vegetable and animal substances, and human excreta; and he will be a great benefactor to Cape Coast and to many other towns which would afterwards be dealt with on the same principle, by'}, {'id': 2804, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST IMPROVEMENTS, AND NEWS FROM ASHANTI.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST IMPROVEMENTS, AND NEWS FROM ASHANTI.', 'last_edit_date': '09-26-1874', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_10_1874#article-9', 'issue_date': '30_10_1874', 'content': 'Sir,—You will be glad to hear that Governor Strahan, having formed a decided partiality for Cape Coast as the seat of Government for the Gold Coast Colony, is actively pursuing those measures which seem to him to be indispensable for removing from its atmosphere those elements of unhealthiness which have made it in the past so fatal to your countrymen, and so much interfered with efficiency in Administrative and Judicial Departments.\n\nUnder Governor Strahan\'s decided and inflexible will, Cape Coast is assuming an entirely new aspect; the filthy hole, for such indeed it was, with its odious smells and disgusting deposits, is now being converted into a wholesome and agreeable place; so much so, that one can now go through any parts of the town without stopping his nostrils, as was heretofore inevitable.

I took the necessary oaths on the evening of the 19th, on landing from the steamer, in presence of several of the councillors, because I could not wait till Monday, for many reasons. I was called to England by the Queen, for the purpose of letting Her Majesty know all about you and this country. I spoke good words for you, and praised you, and said that the country was not bad, but that this town was unhealthy, and killed white and black people, especially the former, caused by its dirty state, in consequence of the kings and chiefs not making their people keep their respective portions clean.

This is mere trifling, and while this nonsense is going on death is surely stealing onward. It will, it must come at last; the horrible cholera sweeping us off as it has done the people of Gambia. When most of the white people are dead, when all day and all night there shall be heard the well-known sound of coffin-making, when we are called upon to follow to the graveyard, at seven in the morning, four out of ten persons with whom we dined last night, then it may, perhaps, occur to the authorities, if there be any left, to give some directions and take some measures to arrest the strides of the awful visitor whom we may shortly expect. If the Government are determined to remain supine in this matter, let them at least provide for the speedy interment of the dead when the expected cholera comes upon us. In the latter part of 1869, when the cholera was expected at Sierra Leone, the Government of that settlement lost no time in making such arrangements as would at any rate lessen the horrors of the possibly impending calamity if it should come.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

There is no blame lying at our door for this. Fifteen or more years ago we reproached one of the Governors as being satisfied to live on a dung-heap, if only he might follow his own vicious propensities; and the Governors may have become more moral, but they do not seem to have become more delicate.

How often, alas! have we since, as we had done before, tried to shame and incite the authorities into something like sanitary arrangements, which might replace the unlimited licence that individual and collective filthiness had so long enjoyed. With the exception of the pestilential graveyard having been removed from the windward to the leeward side of the town very little, however, has been done to render the place a fit habitation for civilised human beings. From their propensity to unlimited indulgence in the most disgusting filthiness, and the heaping it around their dwellings, it is to be presumed that the uncivilised inhabitants of tropical countries are not conscious of any inconvenience or evil results therefrom, although undoubtedly many of the depopulating diseases to which they are subject have their origin in the poisonous miasmas by which they are beset. But that British authorities and the European employés of European mercantile houses should occupy a town, as Cape Coast Town has been occupied by them for a couple of generations, and be content to live (as long as they may be able to do so) and move about among heaps of exposed excrement and garbage, emitting the most disgusting and poisonous odours, is something difficult to comprehend. We find it impossible to account for it in any other way than by the supposition that those who thus consent to live among evils that they have the power to correct, have not lived in the most sanitarily cared-for places before they went there. Still, whatever may be the case as regards the mercantile employés, Governors, Administrators, Chief Justices, and Colonial Secretaries are at least supposed to be gentlemen, and, being gentlemen, one would further suppose would have an acquired, if not an innate disgust of filth, and love of cleanliness. And yet successive batches of officials have appeared on the filthy scene, and passed away without applying a remedy to abominations, the continued allowance of which to exist is a deep disgrace to the British Government. We had not of late heard anything of Cape Coast Town; and our publication of letters of complaint of the abounding filthiness of Anamaboe and Quittah not having led to any Cape Coast denunciation, we had indulged the hope that something had at last been done by the authorities to purify and keep cleaner the old pigsty. The account given by one of the supplemental military officers sent there in consequence of the application of Lieut.-Governor Griffiths for additional troops has dispelled this pleasing illusion, and placed us once again in presence of Cape Coast Town in all its unmitigated filthiness. Three of the Companies of the 2nd West India Regiment—there being no other place for them—were quartered, he says, in that dirty Fanti Town. His description, which we doubt not is just, is horrible in the extreme: ""In addition to the general filth which results from the unclean habits of the people, and the herds of pigs and goats which wander at large through the streets, all the houses possess large open old cesspools, which for many years have never been cleaned in any way, but overflow in a foul green slime, which percolates beneath the houses and oozes out on the further side. Huge centipedes and other disgusting creatures swarm round these pest holes, which are situated close to the windows of the houses provided for English officers. So foul is the stench arising from them as to cause violent vomiting in men who in England were never suspected of having weak stomachs. Myriads of flies are there generated and infest the houses. Every evening from these countless cesspools and steaming earth there rises a poisonous miasma, hanging in so dense a veil that you could almost cut it. This is the atmosphere which must be inhaled all night. At sunrise the vapours slowly ascend, and evaporate as the burning heat of the day sets in. Every drop of drinking water, though nominally condensed, must be boiled and filtered \'ere it can be used with moderate safety. As to the water for washing, its smell is so offensive as to be positively sickening, and not even carbolic acid can purify the sponges which have for some days been in use."" Can anything be imagined more disgraceful than this to a civilised Government? And this has been the seat of British Gold Coast administration for the last thirty or forty years, during which time do not let it for a moment be supposed that the authorities have lived in the Castle, whence they might be supposed to look down with impunity upon the filthy town. No; for the last fifteen years at least, all—Governors, Colonial Secretaries, Chief Justices, and all the British officials (until within the last three or four years, when the seat of Government was moved to Accra)—have lived in this horrid pest-hole, and allowed it to remain in the state, and under the conditions which the correspondent of the Morning Post so graphically describes in the extract from his communication that we have given above. Let it be further borne in mind, while estimating the depth of the disgrace, that when the late Ashanti alarm took place there was a surplus of £70,000 in the colonial chest, or to its credit in the hands of the Crown Agents for the Colonies in London; that there is a source of pure water only some seven miles distant which might be brought at comparatively small cost into the town for general consumption; that there are no conflicting native authorities, the rule of those of Great Britain being absolute; and that this town is on the sea-coast. How often in time past have we pointed out that the water of the sweet river ought to be brought into the town; that the bush around it ought to be cleared away for at least the three miles to which absolute British possession, according to official self-deception alone, extends; that pigs, cesspools, and street pollution by inhabitants and interior natives coming in to trade should be put an end to by sufficient penalties and an effective police supervision, and the town properly drained. We have endorsed above all that the Morning Post correspondent has written as to the state and condition of the town, and which he might equally have written of Winnebah, Anamaboe, and other coast towns, including the Trans-Volta ones, from whence a considerable revenue is now derived. But here we part company with him. He writes: ""Why England should deem it necessary to sacrifice the lives of any of her subjects in order to retain this pestilential spot (after many years\' experience have abundantly proved that no white man can live on it for any length of time) is a mystery. There is not even the excuse of trade."" The revenue raised there, chiefly on trade and commerce with Great Britain, is a sufficient direct answer to the last paragraph, and by inference to all that preceded it. Pestilential spot! Yes; it is a pestilential spot: but so would Calcutta have equally been up to this day if the authorities placed there by the old East India Company had been equally remiss with those of the British Government on the Gold Coast in removing the sources whence the germs of pestilence are distributed. No; the actual pestilential character of the spot does not afford a reason why Great Britain should abandon it, any more than the pestilential character of the town on the Hooghly was thought by the East India Company to afford a reason why they should abandon what has become the seat of a widespread Empire, now regarded as the most valuable possession of the British Crown.

A few feet from the above-mentioned eight-feet-by-four brick building, and within sight of the box, trough, or coffin, is a screen of boarding about eight feet square. Here the male and female prisoners take it in turns to bathe themselves. Crossing the courtyard at its further end is an archway conducting to three or four small rooms. Here the gentlemen debtors and small-pox patients are usually confined. Beyond this is a small yard and room, formerly used as a kitchen. In this yard and room the female prisoners are detained at night, but during the day they may loiter where they please. Political prisoners are in a long room adjoining the women's quarters. They also are locked up at night; but during the day every class of prisoners, without any manner or shade of distinction whatsoever, mix up promiscuously, male and female; and most revolting acts of immorality and unchastity have sometimes been perpetrated.\n\nThe number of male prisoners seldom exceeds 70 to 80, and females 20 to 25, but the usual average may be put down at about 50 males and 6 to 10 females. Small-pox is now raging inside the prison. Three prisoners, one male and two females, have died, and three or more are now laid up with this loathsome contagion, and are kept in the three or four small rooms above-mentioned, where gentlemen debtors are usually detained. There is no other possible arrangement under existing circumstances, and, but for the care, prudence, and foresight of the present Acting Colonial Surgeon, the P. M. O.

If a ruling power undertakes the protection of a community, something more is required than merely devising schemes and expedients how the revenue may be augmented; and I do not understand what the Government means by keeping locked up a surplus revenue of some fifteen or twenty thousand pounds in the colonial chest, and occasionally forwarding a few hundred or a thousand pounds to England to be invested in the Three per Cents for the future benefit of the colony, while Cape Coast Town is literally a heap of filth and ordure, with the exception of the space (about 500 yards) between Government House and the Castle.

We have, as our readers well know, felt the most serious apprehensions that the yellow fever, which had visited Senegal, would descend to Bathurst, as offering a most tempting field for it to revel in. Happily, however, according to latest advices, it seems to have spent its energies at St. Louis, and has died out there. But we were not surprised to hear that while the yellow fever was at the Senegal, a virulent smallpox should have broken out among the natives at Bathurst, it having been almost invariably the case that whenever yellow fever made its appearance among the Europeans on that part of the Coast, there should be a great mortality from small-pox among the natives, who do not suffer from yellow fever, as neither do the Europeans from the native small-pox. In a letter from the Gambia which we insert in this present number, it will be seen that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed Sir Samuel Rowe to call at the Gambia on his passage down the West Coast, to inquire into the great neglect and abuses of which we have so often and so vehemently complained. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of the scare at Cape Coast, Sir Samuel will not have been able to make that visit and inquiry. We are very sorry that this is the case; but, nevertheless, we do venture to hope that the mere fact of such a visit and inquiry having been ordered by the Colonial Office will impel the authorities to make extraordinary efforts to set their house in sanitary order, and that we shall not have again to complain of a state of the burial-ground, the drains, and the general absence of sanitary regulations, such as we have had the painful duty so often to expose and comment upon. The strange neglect by British authorities in almost all the Coast towns of ordinary means to purify the atmosphere is a great disgrace to us as a nation. What has been done at Calcutta, in the East Indies, once as unhealthy a residence for Europeans as any one of the West Coast towns, might long ago have been done in these also. We would ask our readers to glance for a moment at the complaints about the state of Quittah, where a considerable revenue is already raised, and where a much larger one might, it is stated, be raised by a modified scale of Customs' duties, such as would put an end to the temptation of smuggling from the neighbouring sea-coast villages without British jurisdiction. Disgraceful is a word scarcely strong enough to apply to such a state of things. It is a lamentable fact that, so far as the Government is concerned, we do not carry civilization and civilizing efforts with us. Our officers are content to sit upon dung-heaps, surrounded by the most atmospheric-poisoning filth, to collect their Customs' duties; and then we complain of the fatal atmospheric impurities of so many of the sea-coast towns. Is it too much to hope that the new Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony will find some remedy for this fearful state of things? As a medical man, we hope that he will prove to be sensitive in this matter. We feel that he has Herculean tasks before him. His predecessors have done so little that there is overwhelming work for him to do, unless he be allowed to appoint subordinates whom he can imbue with his own spirit.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Moreover, nowhere and at no level did the facilities provided meet the demand nor were they evenly distributed.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

The development of a modern transport system together with the construction of ports and irrigation facilities also helped the growth of a modern agricultural system in the Sudan. However, there is a negative side to this story. First, the infrastructure that was provided was totally inadequate and was clearly meant to promote the interests of Britain more than those of the Sudanese. It is most significant that not one single mile of motor road was constructed in the whole of the Sudan during the period under review while the railway was constructed initially to facilitate British military campaigns and later to promote their cotton and gum projects in Djazïra and the western areas respectively. As in most of the colonies, industrialization was completely neglected.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Trade with Britain put African dependencies at a great disadvantage, as was the case during the great depression. In 1932 Imperial Preference was introduced in British dependencies. Imports from the British Empire had customs duties fixed at between 10 and 50% lower than the general level. But since trade between the dependencies was negligible, the intended beneficiary of the arrangement was obviously Britain. In September 1931 the Colonial Office dispatched a circular to officers administering depen› dencies asking them to help Britain and reminding them that: the interests of the United Kingdom and those of the Colonies and Dependencies are inseparably bound up with one another, that the perils which face the United Kingdom are perils which menace the whole Empire ... that any general collapse of British credit and declir - in the exchange value of sterling must spell ruin for the colonies no less than for the United Kingdom. 83 Despite the higher tariff on non-British goods, their importation, to the advantage of consumers in the dependencies, increased greatly. Canvas shoes and artificial silk and cotton clothing, all from Japan, featured promi› nently, and their prices were far below those of British goods which enjoyed protection. In 1934 the district officer of Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, observed that 'practically every shop in the district'$^{84}$ was stocked with many Japanese goods. The development was especially important during this period of economic distress. As one colonial administrator in Tangan› yika put it, probably with some exaggeration, 'the average African would now be reduced to wearing bark cloth if it were not for the fact that large quantities of cheap cotton goods from Japanese manufacture are exposed for sale in all the town and country shops'.$^{85}$ But the British Government's concern was the success of the British industry and not the welfare of the poor people in the dependencies. In 1934 a further attack was made on non-British goods by raising the tariff to 100%, as a general rule. In addition, a quota system was imposed on the importation of Japanese textiles. There were isolated protests against these measures but the colon› ized people had to pay high prices, thereby promoting imperialist interests at their own expense."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Marketing was greatly neglected by the colonial administrators.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back.

The reason given for this merits quotation: ... The development of a lingua franca has very little connection with immediate expediency, being essentially concerned with enduring values and hence with a penetration which however gradual shall steadily become co-extensive with the country. Applying this criterion neither Swahili nor Ganda nor any other vernacular has admissible claims. 40 And this advice went on to add that only English should be recognized 'as the inevitable lingua franca of the future, a fact which general and education policy should admit without delay'.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply.

Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 180, 'article_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Industrial Education in Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': ""Every month's experience justifies more and more the views of the African-Aid Society upon this question—views which they have only not carried into practical operation because, hitherto, there have been no funds for the work. To raise the industrial status of the African people, they must be taught those things which the civilised world has bit by bit acquired. Leave them to themselves, and they will never learn them. Why should they? They have not the same physical necessities that more northern people have. And physical necessity has been one of the great spurs to northern advancement. From a barbarism almost as degraded as that of the African, we have, under its impulse, gradually progressed to our present industrial, scientific, and social elevation. But there is no reason why the Africans should be condemned to a similar tortoise-like advance. The knowledge we have laboriously and tediously gained, in part from earlier civilizations, we could easily and rapidly impart, but it seems to have been almost the last thing thought of. In our anxiety to Christianise we have too much lost sight of the material aid that a spread of the arts, conveniences, and industrial facilities of civilization can bring to the inculcation of moral and religious truth. The African-Aid Society was formed that it might apply and urge the application of what was evidently so much needed. When it expressed its desire to conduct an emigration of coloured people from Canada and the United States to Africa, it was that it might introduce in their persons engineers, machinists, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, cabinetmakers, brick and tile makers, trained agriculturists, millwrights, wheelwrights, coopers, waggon builders, road makers, &c., &c., &c. The progress of conviction as to the necessity of this has been slow in England. And this is not surprising, because it had not possessed the missionary mind in Africa. Any imaginable sum might be asked for religious missionary purposes in Africa, and it would be obtained. But ask for a small sum to teach the Africans the comforts and decencies, conveniences and industrial appliances of civilised life, and no national sentiment responded to the appeal. This is manifestly wrong. What we have freely received we ought freely to give. We, as a people, two thousand years ago had aid to help us out of our barbarism. The Britons were not left to imagine the utility of roads, and the advantage of clearings through forests: the Romans made roads and clearings for them. They were not left to imagine the advantage and comfort of solidly-constructed and comparatively commodious edifices: the Romans built towns and villages among them. And their work was not intended for mere temporary use alone. Substantial traces of it remain to this day. They are continually challenging our gratitude and admiration. And shall we not imitate in some degree the beneficial example? Shall we not strive to confer solid material benefits upon that Africa we so long assisted to rob of its most valuable possession—its human life; that we so long assisted to plunge deeper and deeper into the thick mire of barbarism, instead of helping her out of it? Our responsibilities toward Africa are far heavier than the public conscience has yet acknowledged. We know all the difference that exists between Great Britain now in Africa, and Rome formerly in Britain. Rome was laying the foundation for a permanent domination. We are not. Nationally, therefore, there is no analogy. But Rome had no such hideous debt of blood to Britain as we have to Africa. And we are Christian, not Pagan. We profess to be governed by higher principles than the Romans knew. We must, therefore, both as Government and people, do more than we have hitherto done for Africa. We must send her other teachers, as well as religious ones. We must establish centres of mechanical and other industry. The missionary mind in Africa is opening to this great truth.

We have four seats of government there: Sierra Leone, now as chief, with Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos. We need not insist that education is absolutely necessary to this progress. We might as well set about demonstrating that food and drink are indispensable to the support of animal life. To build up a civilised nation without first creating an educated class is a moral impossibility. In such a class alone can the seed of civilisation germinate, and by it alone can this new principle of life be developed. When, therefore, the declared enemies and traducers of Africa set forth that education there is an engine of demoralisation, we cast aside the ignorant assertion with the contempt it deserves. They might as well pretend to maintain that the antecessarian inhabitants of these islands, with their paint and feathers, their human sacrifices, and other superstitious abominations, were a nobler people, and presented a more agreeable object for contemplation, than the present British subjects of Queen Victoria. Let us have done at once and for ever with these perverse and contemptible absurdities, and look the educational position and requirements of West Africa boldly in the face. We cannot get rid of the solemn obligation that rests upon us by ignoring or evading it. There it is; and it will crop up more and more as we neglect it. Enough has been done, in despite, we may say, of the Government—and shame it is that we should have reason to say it—to make it impossible for us to recede. With the Christian part of it we have happily nothing to do. Our noble Missionary Societies have taken care of that. By their devoted exertions a certain amount of education, coupled happily with religious teaching, has been bestowed. The Anthropologists say this has brought in added vices instead of new virtues. This is a foul falsehood. Civilised vices there are, no doubt, as there are in Great Britain, but such as they are, they are a step in advance of the savage native abominations, and come not with the missionaries, but have been introduced and propagated by Anthropologists and their admirers and adherents, slave-traders, believers in Mohammedan perfection, lovers of Mohammedan indulgencies, and enemies of Christianity and its blessed precepts. We do not look to them for the solution of the problem of African material and moral regeneration even; for if we did, we should look in vain. We might as well expect to find the sewage-fouled mud of our polluted river-shores producing precious gems. We must look to other sources, and we can find these nowhere else but in a continuance and increase of Christian teaching combined with adequate means of education first introduced and supported by Government. We do not wish to alarm the Treasury or the House of Commons. We know that in the present temper of our executive, and of prominent public politicians of all parties as regards Africa, there is no hope for us in them now; nor do we see ground for such hope during long, long years to come, unless the really Christian portion of our population awake to their great responsibility, and combine to give practical Christianity, its precepts and its duties, their proper share of influence in the councils of this nation. Meanwhile let us deal with things as we find them, and we maintain that there is sufficient revenue raised in the various British settlements (since, according to present official phraseology, they are none of them colonies now) to enable the several administrations on the West Coast to take some very efficient steps for promoting that education among the people without which we can never expect such a number of them to emerge from barbarism as will suffice to form those self-governing nations which the British Parliament desires, and which we desire, to see established there; that there is sufficient revenue for this, and at the same time for those sanitary improvements almost equally indispensable, and to which we are glad to see something like proper attention is being now paid at Lagos. In our last we briefly noticed, in a letter from Cape Coast, the state of the Government school there, placed under uneducated discharged soldiers as schoolmasters. In another article in this day's paper, we bring again prominently forward as it merits the relative expenditure in Sierra Leone, for Government schools, and for police, &c., the former under 3000l. a-year, the latter 14,000l., the Inspector-General of Police (a recently-established office, and almost a sinecure), having a salary of nearly double the amount per annum of the sum spent on education; and if we turn to Bathurst or Lagos, we find no bright spot there. If this creditable to the British Government? Does it not rather show a most scandalous neglect of duty on their part? Can any one maintain the existence of any real desire in Downing-street to raise the people of these settlements rapidly to a state of fitness for self-government, or, indeed, to elevate them at all in the social scale? We demand education for the people of the West Coast. They have furnished abundant evidence of their capacity to profit by it. If the Church of England Missionary Society can fit a boy taken out of the hold of a slaver to become a bishop—and no one has ever questioned the fitness of Dr. Samuel Crowther, the Bishop of Niger, for this sacred office—if out of similar materials it has been enabled to train so many men for the duties of ministers of the Church, as to have justified it in withdrawing Europeans from Sierra Leone, and giving over the churches to native pastorate—if the Wesleyans can raise efficient native catechists and pastors for the Cape Coast District, we are not to be met by the assertion that there is no encouragement to attempt a general education of the natives.

The work of education on the West Coast has hitherto been performed by our Missionary Societies almost at their sole charge, seeing that the Government grants even at Sierra Leone have been meagre and uncertain, being discontinued or diminished whenever there was need of retrenchment in the public expenditure. And nobly they have performed the work, not only of primary, but of more advanced teaching; as witness the Fourah Bay College, and Grammar School of the Church Missionary Society at Sierra Leone, and the primary and high Schools of the Wesleyan Missionary Society in that and other settlements. But our contention was that those Societies ought to be relieved by the Government from bearing alone this burthen, and ought to receive Government assistance to enable them to increase their educational work. Her Majesty\'s Government have deigned at last to open their ears to the complaints, and have sanctioned, and permitted to be issued, Educational Ordinances. And in these Ordinances they seem to have sought to do what our blessed Lord, in the questions we have quoted, implied that no man would do. We have asked for bread and fish; the Government reply is, ""Bread and fish, eh? Not a bit of it; take this stone, and this serpent, and let them content you. We will give your people education—oh, yes; but we will not have any of your Christianity thrust down their throats. Some of our superior officials on the Coast have told us that Deism or Theism, under the name of Mohammedanism, is far better for them than Christianity; and then they have their beautiful heathenism—their witchcraft, fetish priests, poisoners, and, when we do not interfere, human sacrifices. We will not have these things meddled with; no proselytising, if you please. Christianity indeed! we wash our hands of it. Your Christian Professors may come into the schools at certain permitted hours to speak to those who may choose to stay and hear them; but the Mohammedan Mollah and the fetish priest shall do the same. None of your exclusive Christianity, if you please."" Yes; this is the voice of the supposed Christian Government of Great Britain to poor Africa—debased, degraded, ruined by the most foul and loathsome superstitions, relieved here and there by followers of the impostor of Mecca, the great slave-hunters, and domestic slave-holders,—now, at nearly the close of the nineteenth century! What should be the response by those who have hitherto done the work of education, as combined with that of the spread of Christianity, in West Africa? We hope it will be that they will not accept the unhallowed bribe; that they will appeal to their British friends for purely educational funds, as distinguished from those raised for the public ministration of the Gospel. It is not a large annual sum that would be required for this purpose, and we believe it would be willingly given by both Church of England and Wesleyan worshippers. We can scarcely imagine a more evil gift for the West Coast populations than education dissociated from Christian instruction; and it would have been difficult, we think, to frame an Ordinance more unsuited to the condition and wants of a people than that which has forced these remarks from our pen. It is framed upon the British Board School system, the only excuse for the absence of religious teaching under which was to be found in the prejudices of rival sects; and, for it were useless to shut one\'s eyes to the truth, in a dislike on the part of but too many among us to any and every form of religious teaching. No such prejudices exist among the converts from heathenism in Africa, who are ready at all times to accept indiscriminately Church of England and Wesleyan religious services. What is wanted, what is essential on the West Coast of Africa, is to win the people from degrading heathenism to Christianity. Christianity, in its fundamental principles, has been hitherto associated with all the education that has been given to them, and the good seed must continue to be sown, or education will only serve to produce crops of most baleful and poisonous weeds. We cannot, therefore, in any way thank the Government for what it no doubt erroneously considers to be an educational boon. We condemn, and we denounce it.'}]","[{'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I thank you much for your able and well-timed article in your issue of August last on the subject of the Education of the Gold Coast Protectorate, and the responsibility of the British Government in connection with it. Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Government', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'portance, the presence of a continually increasing number of African girls educated in some of the best schools in England.

We appeal on their behalf to the Home Government that this important matter may be taken into serious and unprejudiced consideration. Power is so dear to the hearts of men, and prejudices have so much influence in human decisions, that West Coast Governors and European Executive officers, when consulted by the Secretary of State, will most likely say they, the educated natives, are not fitted for anything but absolute dependence; but the day will come, and we ask that it may now come, when Councils more just and wise shall prevail in Downing Street, and educated West Africa will receive that consideration to which it has now become entitled.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

There is no blame lying at our door for this. Fifteen or more years ago we reproached one of the Governors as being satisfied to live on a dung-heap, if only he might follow his own vicious propensities; and the Governors may have become more moral, but they do not seem to have become more delicate. The public discussions in such a Colonial Representative Chamber sitting in London, as we have suggested, would soon lead to a change for the better in such important matters.

The people unaided are unable to provide themselves with such establishments. The practice has been adopted of sending young men and young women to England for education, but it is a very expensive one and is attended with a great risk, and comparatively very few persons can use it. The success that has attended it is one of a doubtful character. Some have returned home with enfeebled constitutions. English teachers have not generally been able to imbue the minds of their African scholars with patriotism, and a sense of their obligations and responsibility to their country.

Expensiveness and the fear of their succumbing to the effects of a foreign and trying climate have often necessitated a short stay, and placed them at a disadvantage.

He reminded his hearers that England once had a free hand, and did not profit by her opportunities. The Gambia is among the oldest English colonies. It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812.

The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages.

We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both. It is not a little feeble, glimmering light that we thirst to see introduced at those important points of West Africa, but one in educational power that shall resemble the electric among illuminating flames. Great Britain will thus, indeed, justify her presence and extend her beneficent influence on the West Coast of Africa. The work of African civilization is an immense work; the means employed, to be worth anything, must be commensurate with the end to be obtained. We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot. And we cannot conceive on what ground such a work can be any longer neglected and delayed. That the whole civilized world, and more especially Great Britain and the other European countries, have the deepest possible interest in the civilization of Africa, and that development of her wondrous resources which can only take place through the diffusion of civilization, is beyond all doubt; and since West Africa herself, under the organizing and administrative help of Great Britain, can be made to furnish the means, we earnestly exhort the Secretary of State for the Colonies to plant there without delay that tree of knowledge which alone can effect it.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I consider that, as far as may be expected of Missionary Societies, they have been liberal in their efforts to educate the people in some parts of the Coast, and particularly in Sierra Leone, where, besides the Missionary Colleges of the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the former has had a public Grammar School since 1845, and a Female Institution which is nearly as old, if not older, and training masters from England.

The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed.

To that extent, they were a constant source of worry for colonial administrators as the various sedition laws of the mid-i93os and the attempts to establish iron curtains by legislation against certain publications show. The spread of the radio later made the repressive measures which colonial rulers adopted to screen away their colonies from external influences more difficult and less effective.\nAs has been emphasized, constitutionalism, and the use of newspapers and radio as media of expression, were dependent on the availability of legislative institutions in the colonies or the hope of having them, as well as the existence of a significant number of western-educated Africans who could make appropriate use of such institutions and organs of expression. Also, the approach of the western-educated African nationalists pre› supposed the acceptance of Western European models of political develop› ment such as nationalists without their experience could not appreciate. Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development. In several areas of colonized Africa between the two world wars, primary schools were still few and far between and secondary education was a rarity. In British Central Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Soudan and Portuguese Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, there was practically no access to secondary education before the Second World War.

In all the colonies, conflicts occurred between the conservatives and the moderates, and between both of them and the old traditional elite of kings. Such, indeed, was the conflict between the leaders of the NCBWA and those of the Aborigines Rights' Protection Society, and between the leaders of both on the one hand and the traditional rulers led by Nana Sir Ofori Atta in the Gold Coast on the other. These conflicts greatly weakened the nationalist movement in that country. Similarly, it was largely because of the internal dissensions and personality conflicts in the Lagos branch of the NCBWA and the opposition of Sir Kitoyi Ajasa's Nigerian Pioneer and the Lagos conservatives that the fourth session of the NCBWA could not take place in Lagos until 1930. Fourthly, it would appear that the limited elective representation granted between 1923 and 1925 had the effect of politically anaesthetizing the nationalist movements. Finally, and undoubtedly, the death of Casely Hayford in 1930 constituted the final coup de grâce for nationalist activities in British West Africa in general and in the Gold Coast in particular in the inter-war years.\nFor all these reasons, then, by the end of the period under review, politics and nationalism in British West Africa were at their lowest ebb, and it needed two events to ginger them up again, the Ethiopian crisis of 1935 and the Second World War of 1939-45, discussion of both of which belongs to the last volume of this work."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > The outcome of nationalist activities in British West Africa', 'content': ""The question then is why did the nationalist movement in British West Africa have so limited an impact on the people and the colonial govern› ments? The first and most important answer is that neither the NCBWA nor the youth movements ever commanded a mass following nor did any significant linkage occur between urban and rural politics. The leaders could therefore be written off by the colonial rulers as being unrepresenta› tive of the people, a strategy which, in fact, both Sir Hugh Clifford and the Colonial Office pursued. Clifford described the NCBWA leadership as a 'self-appointed congregation of African gentlemen, vainly and erroneously hankering after constitutions and modes of government which were unsuitable and unworkable in Africa'.\nSecondly, in spite of all the rhetoric, neither the leaders of the NCBWA nor those of the youth movements were prepared to use any radical methods to achieve their objectives. It used to be thought that an entirely new style of radical politics developed in West Africa during the inter-war period. But it is quite clear from both the objectives and methods of the nationalist groups and associations, that despite the economic depressions, no such revolutionary development in anti-colonial politics took place. As has been shown, the nationalist politics of the inter-war period should be seen as a transitional period during which both chiefs and intelligentsia participated in agitational politics, and as the formative period for some of the leaders of the nationalist movements after 1945. There were certainly elements of radicalism in the mid-iojos but in general, these movements were moderate nationalist movements, conducting their politics within the colonial framework.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon.

One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

As early as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the states of Africa such as Benin and the Congo could send embassies and missions to the courts of European kings. Even until as late as the 1890s, as we have seen already, some African states could deal with their European counterparts as equals. The Asantehene, the King of Matabeleland and the Queen of Madagascar sent diplomatic missions to the Queen of England in the 1890s. Colonialism put an end to this and thereby deprived African states of the opportunity of acquiring experience in the conduct of inter› national relations and diplomacy.\nBut the loss of independence and sovereignty meant far more to Africans than this. It meant, above all, the loss of their right to control their own destiny, plan their own development, manage their economy, determine their own strategies and priorities, borrow freely from the outside world at large the latest and most appropriate technology, and generally manage or even mismanage their own affairs and derive inspiration and a sense of fulfilment from their successes, and lessons and experience from their failures. In short, colonialism deprived Africans of one of the most fundamental and inalienable rights of a people, the right of liberty.\nMoreover, as Rodney has shown, the seventy-year period of colonialism in Africa was the very period which witnessed tremendous and decisive developments and changes in both the capitalist and socialist countries. It was that period, for instance, that saw the entry of Europe into the nuclear age and the age of the aeroplane and the motor vehicle. Had Africa been in control of her own destiny, she could have benefited from or even been part of these phenomenal changes. But colonialism completely isolated and insulated her from these changes and kept her in a position of dependency. It is clearly in this loss of independence and sovereignty, in this denial of the fundamental right to liberty and in this political isolation imposed on Africa by colonialism that we see another of the most pernicious political impacts of colonialism on Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years? This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

At the same time, Natal had a large African population, many of them returnees from exile whence they had been driven during the Mfecane.\nThe initial difficulties facing the weak colonial administration in Natal concerned the government of the Africans. The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected. As a result, African education remained largely, if not exclusively, the responsibility of the ill-financed and . ill-equipped missionaries, while the administration was done by Shepstone.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'Periodization of colonialism in Africa', 'content': ""From the African perspective, as we have seen already, this period saw African kings, queens, lineage and clan heads all dominated by one over› riding consideration, that of maintaining or regaining their sovereignty, patrimony and culture by the strategy of confrontation or alliance or sub› mission.

We have chosen 1919 not only because it succeeds influential events such as the end of the First World War, the October Revolution in the Russian empire and the calling of the first Pan-African Congress by Du Bois - all of which had a revolutionary impact on the course of world history - but also because by that date opposition to the European occupation of Africa as such had ended in most parts of the continent.\nWe also chose 1935 rather than 1945 as the terminal date of the volume because that was the year of the invasion and occupation of Ethiopia by the Fascist forces of Mussolini. That crises shocked and outraged Africans, especially the educated Africans, and blacks the world over.

However, instead of slowing down, the pace of the spread of Western education and the introduction of technical schools and polytechnics would have increased, as is evident from the programme of the Fante Confederation and the educational reforms in nineteenth-century Egypt.

But it was not African sovereignty and independence alone that had been lost at that time. It represented also an assault on established cultures.

These are the sources for the study of, and the periodization for, the history of colonialism in Africa. As far as sources are concerned, the authors and research students enjoy some advantages as well as disadvantages over those of the other volumes. To take the latter first, this volume and Volume VIII cover periods in which, unlike those of the other volumes, part of the archival materials is still inaccessible to scholars. Indeed, some archival material in several metropolitan countries such as that in France for the period up to 1930 was opened to scholars only after some of these chapters had already been completed. Moreover, with the partition and the entry of so many different European powers into Africa, the problem of language that faces research students becomes a difficult one.\nTo compensate for this, more journals and periodicals become available and published parliamentary papers, debates, commissions of inquiries, papers of private companies and associations, and published annual reports become more numerous than in the periods before; all of these are available. Above all, some of the actors in the colonial drama themselves are still alive and can be and have been interviewed. Others, both African and European, have also begun to publish their memoirs and autobiographies or to recall them in novels, plays and learned treatises. In all these respects, the authors of this volume enjoy some advantages over most of the authors of the other volumes.\nFinally, it appears far more research has been and is still being done on the subject of colonialism and far more has been published and is still being published on it than on any other theme in African history. Indeed, within the last ten years, a five-volume history of colonialism in Africa edited by L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan and published by the Cambridge University Press has appeared. The theme has also attracted far more attention in the Eastern European countries than probably any other theme.

B. Davidson and Michael Crowder in the 1960s, should be briefly looked at.\nSome historians have proposed 1870 as the date for the beginning of the European Scramble for Africa and the imposition of colonial rule. This date, however, seems to be too early. As G. N. Uzoigwe shows in Chapter 2, it was the activities of the French in the Senegambia region, of King Leopold of the Belgians represented by H. M. Stanley, and the French represented by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza in the Congo region, and of the Portuguese in Central Africa that touched off the Scramble and all these activities surely did not commence until the late 1870s and early 1880s. It seems, therefore, that 1880 would be a more appropriate date than 1870.$^{20}$ From 1880 to the collapse of colonialism in the 1960s and 1970s, therefore, the study of colonial rule,and African initiatives and reactions should be divided into three eras: 1880-1919 (subdivided into 1880-1900 and 1900-19, the periods of conquest and occupation respect› ively), which we would term the era of the defence of African sovereignty and independence using the strategy of confrontation or alliance or tempor› ary submission; the period 1919-35 which we would call the period of accommodation using the strategy of protest or resistance; and the period since 1935 which is the period of the independence movements using the strategy of positive action. 21 It is our contention that the period from 1880 to about 1919, the so-called era of pacification in the view of some historians, was the period which, from the European perspective, saw the completion of the partition on paper, the deployment of troops to effect the partition on the ground, and the effective occupation of the conquered areas, signified by the intro› duction of various administrative measures and an infrastructure of roads, railways and the telegraph for the exploitation of the resources of the colonies.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.602, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""The first positive political impact was the establishment of a greater degree of continuous peace and stability following the consolidation of colonialism in Africa than before.

But, then, conditions in Europe during the same period were not so very different either. This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans.

Colonel Ord has in consequence been very hardly pressed on this Lagos annexation question—a question, too, respecting which, with its results, he knew even less than he did about other West Coast questions—which is saying a great deal.

Our West African Colonies are among the oldest of the British possessions, and are also among the least advanced as regards local government and opportunities for commercial development. For many years past the absolute necessity for the construction of railroads in West Africa has been at least tacitly acknowledged by the Home as well as the Colonial authorities: and yet we have only just succeeded in obtaining the preliminary surveys, and there is no knowing how many more years are to elapse before the practical part of the construction will be taken in hand. In his speech at Liverpool, in moving the adoption of the Report, Mr. Ellis Edwards observed that ""in the matter of the construction of railways in West Africa they had not made the progress they looked for this time last year, but they had made some advance. The officers sent to the Gold Coast and to Sierra Leone to make surveys with a view to the construction of a suitable line had returned and presented their reports to the Government. There had been much delay in the preparation and printing of these reports, as no less than five months elapsed before a copy of the report on the schemes for Sierra Leone was received, and nearly a year had gone by since Captain Lang returned from the Gold Coast. It would be some time before they could receive any report on a railway for Lagos, as it was only recently that a Government surveyor had been sent to that colony. They had considered the Sierra Leone schemes. . . . The reports on the Gold Coast surveys had yet to be considered.""\n\nNotice the same old complaint, ""There had been much delay in the preparation and printing of these reports."" We wonder whether that good time is ever coming when the crying needs of West Africa will receive their fair share of attention from the officials at the Colonial Office. Fifty or sixty years ago we can quite understand the authorities saying ""Africa can wait;"" but things have usually changed since then, and the laisser-faire policy is no longer applicable to the West Coast. In the last decade England has lost vast opportunities of political and commercial development which other nations have been only too ready to seize. Our African possessions are hemmed in on all sides by rivals who are straining every nerve to secure advantages which we might easily have retained for ourselves. But that is too late now: all that remains for us is to insure that every means is taken to aid the increase of the trade that is still with us: vexatious customs duties must, where necessary, be abolished, and the means of transport cheapened and simplified.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-05-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN PROSPECTS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The other day we took up a useful little work called ""The Statesman\'s Year Book,"" professing to give a compact statistical account of the various states and governments of the world.

The great check to this northern progress has been the lack of railways in South Africa, and the eastern seaboard being in the hands of the Portuguese. Our nearest base of operations was Kimberley, from which a thousand mile trek northwards is a costly business. Had Western settlers occupied Mashonaland, and found the long southern route strangling the enterprise, while there was a short easy route to the sea eastward, though it ran through Portuguese territory, to that valuable port, Beira, there would have been a railway constructed long ere this.

This was followed by a dark age of savagedom and slavery, when the country was overrun, and all trace of civilisation seems to have been lost. The gold industry was neglected, and Portuguese activity degenerated into a connivance at the slave trade. The discovery and colonisation of the Brazils was probably coeval with this, when Portuguese Africa fell into decay, and the sale of slaves for the New World began instead of employing them in the mines. Next came the inroad of the Zulus from the South.

The textbook highlights the neglect of technical and industrial education in favor of liberal and clerical training, which fostered a disdain for manual labor and agricultural work among the educated. This was compounded by curricula modeled on those of metropolitan countries, rendering them irrelevant to the continent's needs. Educational facilities were grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed, and primarily aimed at producing Africans who would serve the colonial system rather than benefit themselves. Institutions like Achimota College, intended to encourage Africans to remain connected to their heritage, were undermined by Christian missions focused on religious education. The colonial preference for vocational and technically-oriented postsecondary institutions over universities further reflects a limited commitment to advancing Africans' social status. Similarly, The African Times articles criticize the inadequacy of the British educational system, emphasizing the need for practical skills and manual trades, as highlighted by Bishop Ingham's regret over the lack of technical training in Sierra Leone. The British government's minimal involvement in education, leaving it largely to missionary societies, resulted in education limited to basic literacy and religious instruction. Additionally, the articles express dissatisfaction with the British government's prioritization of police and administrative expenses over educational funding, as evidenced by the disproportionate allocation of resources in Sierra Leone.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The general reactions of the colonial regimes in seeking to tighten control by the use of physical force and the imposition of legal disabilities were understandable in view of the fact that the period witnessed the expansion of autocracies and illiberal tendencies in Europe itself. But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use.

As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out. As early as 1887 some of the wealthy Africans had even begun to send their children to Europe for further education and professional training and some of them had returned to the Gold Coast as fully qualified barristers and doctors.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': 'Implications of incorporation', 'content': ""The ultimate decline of Britain's advantage had nothing to do with developments in the periphery of the world-economy.

The remedy, we believe, is to be found—first, in a rigid enforcement of existing laws; but second, and mainly, in directing the attention of the people to some other business than trade. The native African who has been educated merely in a knowledge of letters is not always benefited. He is often a worse man than if he had remained a barbarian. He must be educated in the knowledge of some legitimate business. He must learn some kind of profitable manual labour. He must be taught that to cultivate the soil—with his own hands as well as with the hands of others—is both profitable and honourable. Above all, his moral nature must be developed.

No system, however, is so perfect but that improvement can be suggested; no principle is so fully and entirely sustained but that breaches of it may be perceived. It is a lamentable fact that amongst our own people are found traders whose merchandise is in men, whose principle of trading is that of overreaching and deceit, and whose bearing is arbitrary and tyrannous. The system of Government adopted is particular, and not general, so that nowhere is the character of the British nation uniformly and adequately shown.

Education must have reference to the position of the educated; and where morality and religion are combined in the system, the latter has particular relation to the soul; the former to the body. The soul must be educated and instructed by those foundation principles of salvation that remain for ever unshaken. Our societies are diligent and earnest in the prominency they give to this all-important subject. The soul of man is everywhere the same, in the same otherwise hopeless state, in the same necessity of the same salvation. The same instruction therein applies equally everywhere. But in the instruction afforded to the soul, is the body to be neglected; nay, is the same education equally advantageous for the body everywhere? Just as the food of man is made to vary with the climate and position, so I contend that education for the body should have especial reference to the time and the occasion.

We have four seats of government there: Sierra Leone, now as chief, with Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos. We need not insist that education is absolutely necessary to this progress. We might as well set about demonstrating that food and drink are indispensable to the support of animal life. To build up a civilised nation without first creating an educated class is a moral impossibility. In such a class alone can the seed of civilisation germinate, and by it alone can this new principle of life be developed. When, therefore, the declared enemies and traducers of Africa set forth that education there is an engine of demoralisation, we cast aside the ignorant assertion with the contempt it deserves. They might as well pretend to maintain that the antecessarian inhabitants of these islands, with their paint and feathers, their human sacrifices, and other superstitious abominations, were a nobler people, and presented a more agreeable object for contemplation, than the present British subjects of Queen Victoria. Let us have done at once and for ever with these perverse and contemptible absurdities, and look the educational position and requirements of West Africa boldly in the face. We cannot get rid of the solemn obligation that rests upon us by ignoring or evading it. There it is; and it will crop up more and more as we neglect it. Enough has been done, in despite, we may say, of the Government—and shame it is that we should have reason to say it—to make it impossible for us to recede. With the Christian part of it we have happily nothing to do. Our noble Missionary Societies have taken care of that. By their devoted exertions a certain amount of education, coupled happily with religious teaching, has been bestowed. The Anthropologists say this has brought in added vices instead of new virtues. This is a foul falsehood. Civilised vices there are, no doubt, as there are in Great Britain, but such as they are, they are a step in advance of the savage native abominations, and come not with the missionaries, but have been introduced and propagated by Anthropologists and their admirers and adherents, slave-traders, believers in Mohammedan perfection, lovers of Mohammedan indulgencies, and enemies of Christianity and its blessed precepts. We do not look to them for the solution of the problem of African material and moral regeneration even; for if we did, we should look in vain. We might as well expect to find the sewage-fouled mud of our polluted river-shores producing precious gems. We must look to other sources, and we can find these nowhere else but in a continuance and increase of Christian teaching combined with adequate means of education first introduced and supported by Government. We do not wish to alarm the Treasury or the House of Commons. We know that in the present temper of our executive, and of prominent public politicians of all parties as regards Africa, there is no hope for us in them now; nor do we see ground for such hope during long, long years to come, unless the really Christian portion of our population awake to their great responsibility, and combine to give practical Christianity, its precepts and its duties, their proper share of influence in the councils of this nation. Meanwhile let us deal with things as we find them, and we maintain that there is sufficient revenue raised in the various British settlements (since, according to present official phraseology, they are none of them colonies now) to enable the several administrations on the West Coast to take some very efficient steps for promoting that education among the people without which we can never expect such a number of them to emerge from barbarism as will suffice to form those self-governing nations which the British Parliament desires, and which we desire, to see established there; that there is sufficient revenue for this, and at the same time for those sanitary improvements almost equally indispensable, and to which we are glad to see something like proper attention is being now paid at Lagos. In our last we briefly noticed, in a letter from Cape Coast, the state of the Government school there, placed under uneducated discharged soldiers as schoolmasters. In another article in this day's paper, we bring again prominently forward as it merits the relative expenditure in Sierra Leone, for Government schools, and for police, &c., the former under 3000l. a-year, the latter 14,000l., the Inspector-General of Police (a recently-established office, and almost a sinecure), having a salary of nearly double the amount per annum of the sum spent on education; and if we turn to Bathurst or Lagos, we find no bright spot there. If this creditable to the British Government? Does it not rather show a most scandalous neglect of duty on their part? Can any one maintain the existence of any real desire in Downing-street to raise the people of these settlements rapidly to a state of fitness for self-government, or, indeed, to elevate them at all in the social scale? We demand education for the people of the West Coast. They have furnished abundant evidence of their capacity to profit by it. If the Church of England Missionary Society can fit a boy taken out of the hold of a slaver to become a bishop—and no one has ever questioned the fitness of Dr. Samuel Crowther, the Bishop of Niger, for this sacred office—if out of similar materials it has been enabled to train so many men for the duties of ministers of the Church, as to have justified it in withdrawing Europeans from Sierra Leone, and giving over the churches to native pastorate—if the Wesleyans can raise efficient native catechists and pastors for the Cape Coast District, we are not to be met by the assertion that there is no encouragement to attempt a general education of the natives.

Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Bishop of Sierra Leone on the Education of the West African', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In his book, ""Sierra Leone after a Hundred Years"" (Seeley & Co.), Bishop Ingham, in reviewing the work which has been accomplished in and around Sierra Leone, observes:—\n\n""It is impossible not to regret that the Church Missionary Society were unable to develop in the schools of the Colony some accurate knowledge of manual trades. The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa. Other bodies, and notably the Roman Catholics, seem to be far ahead of us in this respect. How far they fail in developing the minds and consciences of the Africans we will not here discuss; but their systems of technical training are thoroughly worthy of imitation.""\n\nThe Bishop goes on to explain that the work that has been accomplished is by no means to be deprecated—indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine how low Sierra Leone must have fallen, mentally and morally, were it not for the mission work carried on in face of such grave difficulties, and upon a soil necessarily so unpromising, since the first occupation of the Colony 107 years ago.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I consider that, as far as may be expected of Missionary Societies, they have been liberal in their efforts to educate the people in some parts of the Coast, and particularly in Sierra Leone, where, besides the Missionary Colleges of the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the former has had a public Grammar School since 1845, and a Female Institution which is nearly as old, if not older, and training masters from England. The Government is indebted to them for the measure of educated native intelligence which it brings into requisition in its service. These Societies have shown that Africans are capable of any degree of improvement, and created a thirst for learning which the people are now anxious to have satisfied.\n\nI am not aware that their general educational work was subsidized by Government all the while they were at it; and it was hardly to be expected that the people themselves, mostly poor liberated slaves, could have contributed much for its support. The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed. It is the duty, and will be to the honour of the Government to seek to liberate from slavery the minds of those whose bodies only have been made free. They are yet the slaves of ignorance, superstition, and folly, and can and will do no credit either to themselves or to the Power that has given them the status of freed men if they are left to continue uneducated; nor will they be ever qualified for a proper and wholesome use of the position they enjoy, and the power placed in their hands; and by how much the mind is superior to the body, by so much is the slavery of the mind worse than that of the body.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation.

Examples of such responses aimed at overthrowing the colonial system because of its unbearable oppression and exploitation were the Ndebele-Shona Chimurenga of 1896-7, the Herero revolt of 1904 and the Bambata or Zulu rebellion of 1906."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Africano (The African Voice), pursued a similar objective as the self-defined guardian of African peasants and workers.

Throughout this period editorials vigorously denounced and carefully documented the abuses inherent in the system of chíbalo.

The editors were particularly incensed by the common practice of seizing 'African women to repair and construct roads, not even supplying them with food nor paying them a salary', while 'forcing them during the rainy season to sleep in mud-huts, beside the road, like slaves'. 105 The newspapers also unleashed a broadside attack on the conditions of employment of free African workers. They deplored the fact that peasants and nominally free agricultural workers were compelled to work on Euro› pean estates 'from sunrise until sunset earning hardly a shilling a month', that Mozambicans working in the South African mines are 'denied the right to select their own employers ... and die like flies in the mines', that African workers are arrested and beaten if they lack proper identifica› tion, and that the state used chíbalo labourers to break strikes and drive down wages of free workers.$^{106}$ The informal colour bar conventions, which froze Africans in the lowest paying jobs while reserving the most desirable employment for Europeans, was also the target of several editorials."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In practical life the ascendancy of this racist theory led to a policy of denying Africans, no matter how well educated, equal rights and oppor› tunities with the whites in the colonial service. In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""It should be quite obvious from the above analysis that those scholars who are of the opinion that colonialism was an unmitigated disaster for Africa and that it caused nothing but underdevelopment and backwardness have overstated their case. Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans.

Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 429, 'article_title': 'Administration of Justice—Terrible Revelations', 'full_section_title': 'Administration of Justice—Terrible Revelations', 'last_edit_date': '04-14-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': ""What seems to me an act of gross cruelty and oppression has also just been practised on a man who, for some years, has been a Wesleyan local preacher, but through the bad conduct of his wife has been suspended from his duties until the issue of his divorce case (which he has brought himself) is settled.

I implored of him to take the irons off, which he did; but still the poor wretch is kept in a most loathsome, dark cell, to eke out a miserable punishment on mere suspicion, without a chance of a trial. I do not say that Ricketts is or is not guilty; all I say is, that before a man is brought to trial here his health is so seriously injured, that he rarely lives long after escaping from the black holes of the prison at Cape Coast, which were never intended for human beings to live in, but only as stores for gunpowder, and other goods suited to African markets.""}, {'id': 1396, 'article_title': 'Death of a European from Improper Treatment in the Prison at Accra', 'full_section_title': 'Death of a European from Improper Treatment in the Prison at Accra', 'last_edit_date': '07-27-1868', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_09_1868', 'content': ""Cross-examined by Mr. Lovell: I was one of the committing magistrates.

The floor was covered for about three inches deep with a mixture of straw, mud, dung, and sand; two diseased, stark-naked human beings were crouched each in a corner; not a bench or stool to sit on, nothing but the damp, reeking, filthy, dung-covered floor to sit on, to lie down on, or to eat on.\n\nThis ought not to need comment from us.

Among such measures we cannot avoid thinking that the confinement of Mr. Simpson, Surgeon Jones, and Colonel Mends for seven days in this model prison cell, with all its filth and all the accommodation and the inmates found in it by poor Mr. Lovell when they sent him there, would be one of the most effective; even as we think a few days' shot-drill and treadmill upon Bathurst Gaol diet, and after sixteen and a half hours' fasting and other hard labour, would be a corrective for Admiral Patey in his vagaries.""}, {'id': 1588, 'article_title': 'THE MURDER IN BATHURST GAOL.', 'full_section_title': 'THE MURDER IN BATHURST GAOL.', 'last_edit_date': '06-23-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_06_1869', 'content': 'Prisoners are being systematically murdered in Bathurst Gaol. The evidence we now print is, to our mind, conclusive on this point. We were slow to believe it. When we first heard of the death of Joseph Gordon, and the verdict of the coroner\'s jury, we thought there must be some mistake. We were not disposed to imagine that an unfortunate petty criminal—a man sentenced to a few months\' imprisonment with hard labour—could have so aroused the evil passions of authorities or gaolers as to induce them to inflict on him an unwonted and fatal degree of punishment. And in this we were right, although wrong in our doubt as to the man having been murdered. Gordon was not in any way exceptionally treated. He was only one of many, all of whom were subject to the same system—a system so barbarous and atrocious that a better could scarcely have been devised if the killing off a percentage of the gaol population had been a deliberately contemplated result. Look at the evidence! The coroner\'s jury had returned a verdict that the man was killed by shot-drill and treadmill punishment. The Administrator of the colony, it appears, appoints and regulates the criminal employment. This was supposed to be appointed and regulated by Ordinance, the colony having a sort of legislative council. Admiral Patey, however, seems to have acted without Ordinance as regards shot-drill. He therefore rightly viewed the finding of the jury as involving something of a criminal charge against himself. He is consequently dissatisfied with it. He knows the power of quasi-omnipotent and irresponsible West African governors to elicit from subordinate officials and others in those colonies just such opinions as they themselves desire to have expressed, when the said governors refer matters to them. He therefore ordered Gordon\'s body to be exhumed and a post-mortem examination to be made. The surgeon found the right lung, liver, and spleen to be most extensively diseased, but believed the immediate cause of death to be inflammation of the lungs (vide No. 2). If the Administrator had possessed a particle of wisdom he would have stopped here. But the verdict of the jury had condemned his favourite shot-drill and treadmill exercise, and he would not stop there. He demands Dr. Waters\', the examining surgeon\'s, opinion as to whether the death was caused by those punishments, &c. It will be seen presently that in presenting the circumstances, he grossly misstated them in his own favour. Dr. Waters replies (No. 9) that ""in his opinion such hard labour would not directly produce inflammation of the lungs."" The Administrator refers to Dr. Burrows, the Chief Military Medical Officer, who makes a similar reply. The Chief Magistrate is then ""requested to give his opinion as to the legal effect of the verdict, and whether it was not the duty of the Coroner to direct the jury to find a specific verdict against some person,"" &c. (No. 7). Mr. Chalmers, the Magistrate, says (No. 8) that ""it is impossible to extract from the evidence such a verdict, no witness having stated the circumstances or the authority under which Gordon was subjected to the treadmill and shot-drill; an omission,"" he adds, ""the more remarkable that there is, apparently, an inconsistency in the infliction of these punishments upon a man selected for the responsible duty of hospital attendant."" This must have been ""touching the raw;"" but the Administrator is determined to go on tightening the rope, figuratively speaking, about his own neck. An additional inquiry is ordered. There is no power to take this evidence on oath, so it is taken on declaration, under the Act 5 and 6 William IV. To realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. There are rules and regulations by Ordinance, but the Governor gives verbal orders to go beyond them, and the gaoler obeys. Hard labour was previously understood to be ""that the prisoners worked in gangs, in chains, in public or other works."" The present Administrator made an addition to this. He ordered that in addition they should have half an hour shot-drill in the morning, and half an hour treadmill in the evening. (Admiral Patey had stated it as ten minutes each to Dr. Waters.) While the Admiral was absent in England four months, the gaoler had discontinued these punishments; but when he heard he was coming back he falsified his journal to conceal his humanity. Admiral Patey calls him to account for it. He replied that he omitted them because the men have such heavy work on the sea-wall and drains. He then receives orders to resume the shot-drill and treadmill, and this is the routine: The men rise at half-past five, begin work at six (without food); are brought back to gaol at half-past nine, shot-drill till ten, then breakfast (their first food for the day), which consists of one pound of rice, boiled plain, with salt; then to work again till half-past four, treadmill till five, then dinner (their only other meal), consisting of half a pound of bread and half a pound of beef, including bone; then locked into cells at six. Thus, when placed on shot-drill, the men have been sixteen and a half hours without food, and on work three and a half hours of that time. No wonder that ""prisoners complain of their chests"" after their 24-pounder shot-drill; no wonder ""they fall down sweating"" at the treadmill. We repeat that to realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. We are not squeamish about making prisoners work, but this evidence causes us an indescribable feeling of disgust and horror. We have given an account of the diet of these hard-labour prisoners to whose tasks daily shot-drill and treadmill were added by Admiral Patey—imposed by verbal order, without their having been prescribed by any Ordinance, ordered to be performed at hours when the men were exhausted by labour and long fasting. But that which constitutes the gravamen of the charge against Admiral Patey, is that he imposed and ordered, and inexorably exacted, these additional and trying labours without any previous medical examination of the men to know whether they were able to perform them without danger to their lives. Can anything be more atrocious than this? Are the lives of men, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment because they cannot pay a fine imposed (see the Gordon evidence) to be thus trifled with by some insane Administrator?—for the most charitable presumption is that such a man must be insane. The medical evidence asserts that ""three-fourths of the natives who come under medical examination are ruptured"" (see No. 17); and yet this probably ruptured man, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment as an alternative of a fine, is put on the treadmill and shot-drill! To be sure these men are only Africans, and the Administrator is an Englishman and a Rear-Admiral; yet, though they are so mean and he so exalted, we should scarcely have ventured to think that when the gaoler told him ""the shot-drill was too severe for the men, and that sometimes they fell off,"" he could have had the criminal inhumanity to reply, ""If any man falls off, you must keep him his time at it.""

The coroner's inquest, which took place in July last, reveals a state of things more worthy of the most barbarous ages, than of the civilisation and sanitary advancement of the year 1868. The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying. What attention this displayed upon the part of the physician and jailer of the prison! Chief Magistrate Parker is so fond (in the indulgence of an ignorant and despotic spirit) of crowding prisons, surely he should see that some sort of sanatory provision should be carried on within their dismal\n\nprecincts!

It would be unreasonable to expect a British public to believe what has really taken place at Accra, a town situated on the Gold Coast, and governed by the British Government; but should any doubt exist as to the truth of what I am about to relate I beg most respectfully to refer the incredulous to the records of Her Majesty\'s Court at a place lately named Fort Ussher, but for 250 years known as Fort Crève Cœur, adjoining James Town, Accra.

That several agents of these vessels had been at Accra. That he had seen the captains and agents of these vessels, but never asked them to take the deceased. That he did not consider it his duty to do so. That he did not know what diet the prisoner was fed on. That it was not his business to know. That the prisoner was subjected to attacks of ague and fever, but had recovered. That the deceased had a relapse, and on the night of the 26th July, extreme prostration ended his existence. That no minister of religion was asked to visit the prisoner. That he was not aware that there was any rule for calling a minister of religion to the deathbed of a prisoner. That he never communicated the state of the deceased\'s health to those connected with him, as he did not consider it necessary.

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters. I am against the idea that nothing but cruel whipping is considered punishment by the negroes, who would be quite as easily kept in order by solitary confinement, which they hate, or by hard labour, which last means of correction is recommendable from the economical point of view.""', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Death of a European from Improper Treatment in the Prison at Accra', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Henry Richter: I am head gaoler at Accra.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Letter to Earl Granville in Favour of Admiral Patey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'insufficiency of prisoners, and merely on the ground that as he was paying them for a day\'s labour he was entitled to make them give treadmill instead of other labour if he so chose; and we shall never cease to denounce a man as guilty of something very like murder who imposes such punishments as those of treadmill and shot-drill, without previous medical examination as to the fitness of a prisoner to perform them. ""Fidelis"" does not see that he condemns his own view and Admiral Patey\'s most unjustifiable and criminal conduct in this respect, when he attempted to justify the latter on the ground that ""the unfortunate prisoner had met with some accident previously, which would have caused his death in the long run; and that he did not die under the punishment, or immediately afterwards."" We have no wish to be hard upon ""Fidelis;"" and Admiral Patey being removed, we will not pursue this subject further. With regard to the charge against the Admiral of having augmented the horrors and ravages of the cholera by his cruel and obstinate parsimony, no convictions of Mr. Bocock or any other person to the contrary, however much we respect them, can be allowed to weigh in our minds for a moment against the weight of evidence—especially of statistical evidence—establishing his culpability.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working."" We are glad to learn that under the provisions of a new Order in Council the administration of justice in similar cases seems likely to be simplified. A slave-dealer named Astrop gave an extraordinary piece of information to the authorities of the Gold Coast.

We need only refer to one pamphlet, published in 1833, under the title, ""Three Months in Jamaica in 1832."" This little publication had an enormous sale, and did much to rouse the British nation to a sense of the enormities daily committed in her distant colonies. The author went out to Jamaica with the intention of residing in a business capacity on a sugar plantation. He was one of those who did not believe in the horrors of slavery, and thought that our factory children in England were worse off than any plantation slaves. He was soon undeceived. Proceeding on horseback to the estate soon after his arrival, and enjoying the exquisite tropical scenery, he came upon a gang of negroes at work, most of them females. As he rode past the driver cracked his tremendous whip, shouting out, ""Work! work!"" and from that moment the enchanting scenery and the beautiful humming-birds of Jamaica had no longer any charm for him. The first evening of his arrival at the plantation the overseer gave the command, ""Blow shell!"" A large shell was blown, and four athletic negro drivers appeared, bringing in six slaves. For some slight defect in the tally of the day\'s work these men had to be flogged. The flogging of the men is described in terms too painful to repeat; but worst of all is the account given of similar punishments inflicted upon women, some of them quite young girls. The author took pains to inquire whether this treatment was general, and he came to the conclusion that it was next to impossible to find a slave, either male or female, who had not been flogged. But this was only one and the most ordinary form of punishment; the stocks and contrivances for hanging negroes by their thumbs, wrists, etc., were only too common, whilst hundreds were killed outright. This picture is too revolting to contemplate at the present day, and to us now it appears almost incredible.\n\nIt is refreshing to record the feelings of joy and gratitude with which Mr. Buxton and his friends received the accounts of ""the admirable conduct of the negroes on the great day of freedom."" Mr. Buxton says: ""Throughout the colonies the churches and chapels had been thrown open, and the slaves had crowded into them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the solemn moment, all hushed in silent prayer.

A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.764, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': 'When African students lived in America during the colonial period, they created the context for a different relationship between Africans and AfroAmericans and between African students themselves drawn from all over the African continent.

In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics.

As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927.

As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In parts of Africa, especially among such chiefless peoples as the Igbo, Ibibio, Ogoja, Tiv, Idoma, Birom, Angas and Gwari of Nigeria where it was difficult to identify the traditional rulers and associate them with the work of the colonial government, many members of the new elite came from among those who in pre-colonial times would have been classified as commoners. Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

We have at length, thank God, established a public school, under a most gifted inspector, Mr. Popplestone; and the Governor, with that wisdom which characterises all his public acts, has inaugurated the splendid and inspiriting system of competitive examination. A new and rising generation will thus see the Legislative Council enlarged, and the educated African having a voice in the little senate of his country. An educated people can never be an oppressed people any more than strong waters can be kept in complete subjection.

The Government is indebted to them for the measure of educated native intelligence which it brings into requisition in its service. These Societies have shown that Africans are capable of any degree of improvement, and created a thirst for learning which the people are now anxious to have satisfied.\n\nI am not aware that their general educational work was subsidized by Government all the while they were at it; and it was hardly to be expected that the people themselves, mostly poor liberated slaves, could have contributed much for its support. The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed. It is the duty, and will be to the honour of the Government to seek to liberate from slavery the minds of those whose bodies only have been made free. They are yet the slaves of ignorance, superstition, and folly, and can and will do no credit either to themselves or to the Power that has given them the status of freed men if they are left to continue uneducated; nor will they be ever qualified for a proper and wholesome use of the position they enjoy, and the power placed in their hands; and by how much the mind is superior to the body, by so much is the slavery of the mind worse than that of the body. Besides these freed slaves, there is a very large originally free but poor population, who cannot provide schools for their children.

There was a settlement there before the British Government commenced its crusade against the traffic in human beings, but the population was very small, and the colony had a precarious existence until it was placed under the control of the African Institution, an organization established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. This body, which had the support of all the great men engaged in the anti-slavery movement in England, directed its efforts to the amelioration of the condition of the freed slaves, and did in its time an immense amount of good. Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, was made the head-quarters of the association on the coast, and the captured slaves were landed and settled there. An idea of the extent to which this kind of colonization was carried may be gathered from the fact that the total number of slaves emancipated at Sierra Leone between June, 1819, and January, 1833, was 27,697. The exertions of the association were not merely directed to the settlement of the slaves. A system of education was inaugurated, and the settlers were trained in useful arts. The funds of the association were not always well employed, but the general result of their operations is highly satisfactory, and such as to reflect high honour upon the benevolence of the English people. Sierra Leone is now a flourishing colony, and its inhabitants are further advanced on the paths of civilization than, perhaps, any other body of Africans. Education is widely diffused amongst the community, and many of the higher classes have obtained academic distinction in England, and risen to positions of eminence in their own country. In every walk of life, descendants of emancipated slaves are distinguishing themselves, and justifying the confidence of those who believe in the possibility of the civilization of the negro race.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.749, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Superior General Education at Sierra Leone by the Church Missionary Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—At last there will be a college for general education in Western Africa, under the auspices of the invaluable Church Missionary Society.

As regards West Africa the phrase has a significance altogether too slow. Even ""leaps and bounds"" does not adequately represent the rate of progress, which can only be measured by the pace of the steam engine. That too, will presently be distanced by the onward move of events which has already brought West Africa to the threshold of such an advanced outpost of civilisation as technical education. This is a sign of progress the more remarkable when it is remembered that at a not very remote period the principal instruments of civilisation in Africa were reputed to be rum and gunpowder. But the schoolmaster, chiefly through the medium of the missionary societies, has long been abroad in Africa. Light on the subject is derived from The Lagos Weekly Record, which recently, in commenting on the possibilities of the Yoruba country, as indicated in the Governor\'s report, remarked that ""The time was at hand when the civilised Natives, now appearing to flourish in the settlement, will demand outlets for their energies, and new sources of livelihood; when in order to succeed, or even to live, they will be obliged to join the great army of aboriginal producers, or ally themselves to the foreign consumers, or be crushed between the two.""\n\nThe necessities thus summarised are recognised both by the Government and by the missionary societies, and the former is devising the establishment of an institution for training youths in various handicrafts. At present, it is stated, the whole of the coast is dependent for mechanics upon the protégés of the Basel Mission and repatriates from the Brazils. The extension of the work of technical education is encouraged by the success that has attended the efforts of the Basel missionaries, thanks to whom ""the Gold Coast is now the principal source whence good coopers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights can be obtained, and the skilled mechanics of Accra are in great demand all over the West Coast from Sierra Leone to the Congo."" The fact that there is scope in the Colony, as well as at other points along the West Coast, for almost any number of skilled mechanics, certainly favours the enterprise now under the consideration of the Government, and this scope for technical skill cannot fail to be greatly broadened as the interior is increasingly opened up. The practical steps which are being taken in the direction of equipping African youths in the most modern of civilised fashions for the struggle for existence on their own soil may be briefly summed up. The Bishop of Sierra Leone, assisted by Canon Taylor Smith, will, during their present visit to England, make an effort to raise £2,000 for the erection at Freetown of a technical school for the education of young Africans: whilst Captain Denton, during his residence in England on leave, will give attention to the details of the proposed Government scheme.', 'last_edit_date': '1894-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1894#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When writing last month on the all-important subject of the future spread of Christian civilization in West Africa, we pointed out that educated natives, more or less under the influence of Christian faith, more or less imbued with Christian principles, more or less governed by Christian precepts, are and will be indispensable as a vanguard of the great army of civilization that must be projected upon the ignorant barbarism of heathen Africa whenever the means for such projection shall be arranged. We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But besides the establishment of elementary schools, it is desirable for the Government to aid in the establishment of superior colleges for young men and young women in its most advanced West African settlement, Sierra Leone.

The practice has been adopted of sending young men and young women to England for education, but it is a very expensive one and is attended with a great risk, and comparatively very few persons can use it. The success that has attended it is one of a doubtful character. Some have returned home with enfeebled constitutions. English teachers have not generally been able to imbue the minds of their African scholars with patriotism, and a sense of their obligations and responsibility to their country.

Expensiveness and the fear of their succumbing to the effects of a foreign and trying climate have often necessitated a short stay, and placed them at a disadvantage.

It is greatly to be hoped that such an earnest appeal will not be suffered to pass by unheard. It is gratifying to state that the Accra Church of England High-class School has been fairly established and set in proper working order, and since its establishment the number of its pupils has been steadily on the increase. If, as stated in my previous correspondence, such a school as the High-class School be amply and efficiently supported, it will prove a great boon to the place. That the educational work that is thus being inaugurated here needs such support as you have pleaded for will be evident from the fact that it has not been undertaken by the Church Missionary Society, as your remarks would seem to indicate, but by the sole efforts of some of the native residents of this place, who, sensible of the great educational wants of the community, have requested the Bishop of Sierra Leone to aid them in the establishment here of the Church of England with a properly-organized school; and the kind-hearted prelate, ever ready to lend a helping hand to every very good work, promised to aid their efforts in the undertaking. From this it will be seen that such needful help as you have advocated is a *sine qua non* in the proper development of education in this place; and should it be afforded, an efficient staff of competent teachers will be secured, and high-class schools, grammar schools, collegiate schools, and other seminaries of learning will be established along this Coast, which will undoubtedly be productive of unspeakable benefit to the country at large. This, Mr. Editor, in my humble opinion, will be the only panacea for the effectual eradication of the moral, social, and intellectual evil under which ""the land is groaning.""\n\nThe hope of this country\'s elevation seems to me to be in the rising and future generations, in the proper development of their intellectual faculties, and the instilment into their minds of the ""sweets"" of education.

The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa. Other bodies, and notably the Roman Catholics, seem to be far ahead of us in this respect. How far they fail in developing the minds and consciences of the Africans we will not here discuss; but their systems of technical training are thoroughly worthy of imitation.""\n\nThe Bishop goes on to explain that the work that has been accomplished is by no means to be deprecated—indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine how low Sierra Leone must have fallen, mentally and morally, were it not for the mission work carried on in face of such grave difficulties, and upon a soil necessarily so unpromising, since the first occupation of the Colony 107 years ago.

We refer our readers again to his letter on this very important point, because we feel that as the past has depended, so the future must in no small degree depend, on this of late most calumniated body of men.

It has now been sufficiently established that the Africans are receptive, that they are easily taught not only the rudiments of education, but when good masters are found for them, and they are placed under a good system, the higher branches also. We are not, therefore, asking the British Government to take a leap in the dark—to organize educational institutions without absolute knowledge as to whether the people are capable of receiving education. We could point to members of that once despised African race who occupy really an eminent position in law and medicine; and if we have not yet skilled engineers among them, it is only because there have not yet been inducements among them to the cultivation of those sciences whose mighty power is at this time revolutionizing the world. There is every possible encouragement, therefore, to the British Government in entering upon the noble work which we maintain that it is now their duty to undertake and set about in right good earnest. We would have two superior institutions established, one at Lagos and the other at Accra. These settlements and seats of Government are at so little distance from each other, and the facilities for passing from the one to the other are so frequent and so good, that one supreme organizing and superintending educational head would suffice for both. It is not a little feeble, glimmering light that we thirst to see introduced at those important points of West Africa, but one in educational power that shall resemble the electric among illuminating flames. Great Britain will thus, indeed, justify her presence and extend her beneficent influence on the West Coast of Africa. The work of African civilization is an immense work; the means employed, to be worth anything, must be commensurate with the end to be obtained. We need for those West African countries a host of African evangelists and apostles of civilization; we ask that ignorance shall be beaten down by an array of educational power capable of overcoming its inertia, conquering its will, and subduing to itself its sympathies and its love. Oh, 'tis a glorious work to be undertaken, a glorious aim to be accomplished—a work and an aim worthy of a Government that has taken seriously in hand the deliverance of South-eastern Europe from the paralyzing influences of a rule under which every noble aspiration has been strangled, and the commonest principles of humanity have been outraged and trampled under foot. And we cannot conceive on what ground such a work can be any longer neglected and delayed. That the whole civilized world, and more especially Great Britain and the other European countries, have the deepest possible interest in the civilization of Africa, and that development of her wondrous resources which can only take place through the diffusion of civilization, is beyond all doubt; and since West Africa herself, under the organizing and administrative help of Great Britain, can be made to furnish the means, we earnestly exhort the Secretary of State for the Colonies to plant there without delay that tree of knowledge which alone can effect it.

The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

We say “religious education,” because all education for a long time to come must embrace the religious element, since all the teachers capable of imparting instruction have been educated by one or other of our great Missionary Societies. And well for Africa that it must do so; for education merely secular—education without any attempt to impart with it the restraining influences of Christianity—would curse at least as much as it would bless. Among older communities, the control of public opinion, the existence of a higher moral standard, the general outward profession of religion, may—we do not say they will, but they may—prevent mere secular instruction in schools, to the exclusion of the religious element, from producing those pernicious results which would otherwise most certainly accrue. But in West Africa, among people but lately redeemed from barbarism, and surrounded by a heathen population debased by the most loathsome superstitions and most revolting practices, the results of mere secular education could not be other than deplorable.

The General History of Africa highlights the authoritarian and paternalistic nature of colonial systems, where political power was not meaningfully conferred upon Africans. Colonial administrators often manipulated traditional rulers, reducing them to mere instruments of control, thereby eroding their authority and trust among their subjects. This exclusion is further exemplified by electoral systems in places like Algeria and South Africa, which favored European settlers and left Africans with little to no political representation. The imposition of European bureaucratic structures, coupled with the disregard for indigenous socio-political systems, further disempowered local communities. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the closed nature of councils and the lack of public access to information about new ordinances, which alienated African leaders and communities. The appointment of foreign officials who lacked sympathy for the local population, along with instances of mishandling official duties and misuse of power, further eroded trust in the colonial administration. The lack of redress for grievances, as illustrated by the dismissal of Charles Bates without inquiry and the failure to address petitions against officials like Mr. Huggins, highlights systemic governance issues. Together, these observations from both sources vividly illustrate the exclusion, disempowerment, and lack of transparency and accountability that characterized colonial governance in Africa, leaving African leaders uninformed and powerless.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide several details that support the claim that colonial governance in Africa was characterized by a lack of transparency and accountability.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

And now I must again complain bitterly of the irregularity and injustice still carrying on at this post-office. The postmaster is a foreigner, of Spanish descent—one of those who have but little or no sympathy with the blacks. When the mail-steamer arrives, and the mail-bags are landed, all and every the Europeans are allowed into the post-office; whereas the poor blacks are kept at an awful distance from the office-door; consequently, some of your subscribers have still to sustain the loss of their papers, which are walked away with by those who are not subscribers at all. Complaint of this has been made, but no redress has been obtained. Again: this post-office ought to be open every day from ten a.m. to three p.m. Instead of this, the post-office only opens on every mail day, and closes two or three hours after the arrival of the mail-bags. Formerly, it was understood that the mails were to be closed twenty-four hours after the arrival of the mail-steamer at Bathurst; but it is quite the reverse now. As evidence: in August last the mail arrived from the coast at twelve noon, and was closed at two p.m. of the same day; last month from the coast, arrived at ten a.m., and closed at two p.m. of the same day; this month she arrived from England on the 6th at twelve noon, and was closed at three p.m., notice stuck out at two, say, one hour's notice; and yet the vessel was here until twelve o'clock the next day. Now, then, is this seeking the interest of the public or of the post-office itself? Surely these things ought to be looked into. All I know is that there is something very like embezzlement going on in that post-office as regards the detention of papers, and we look upon you to enforce some order therein in justice to your subscribers. The office certainly could not be kept open every day now, because the postmaster has two appointments; he is acting auditor as well as postmaster. As postmaster he receives 80l. per annum; and this, under the present system, is for attendance two days in a month. I am sorry to say that everybody has to complain of this foreigner appointed as postmaster in the Gambia, and I trust that some steps will soon be taken to ensure a better arrangement in this office.—I am, Sir, yours truly,\n\n**Gambian.**\n\nWe have also received copy of a Memorial addressed to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which Charles Bates prays that inquiry may be made into the cause of his dismissal after forty years' public service. Upon the ex parte statement, we are bound to say that it seems to us great injustice has been done to an old public servant, and we are sorry to learn\n\nthat Colonel D'Arcy, the Governor, refused to forward the Memorial to the Colonial-office.""}, {'id': 595, 'article_title': 'Want of Employment in the Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'Want of Employment in the Gambia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-3', 'issue_date': '23_05_1865', 'content': '\n\nI commence with our Colonial Surgeon, Dr. Sherwood, who, besides this, is holder of several other appointments, which would do for five other persons, if no distinction of colour was made; for he is also the ""Overseer of Palm Wine,"" ""Clerk of Council,"" ""Registrar of the Vice-Admiralty Court,"" ""Coroner,"" and ""Sheriff."" To discharge his duties as Overseer of Palm Wine, which he knows nothing of, he employed a young man (who was doing this work for our now Acting Secretary, whilst holding it, for upwards of three years, if my memory serves me right) for a small salary, not half the amount it produces. Then, as ""Clerk of Council,"" is it right that every one should be acquainted with the transactions of the meetings? If he cannot keep the minutes himself, ought he not at least to employ a proper person, who would seek his own interest by not divulging the contents of the book in which records are made? Instead of which, he employs any one he can first get after Council-day. Go to Mr. Barrack Surgeon. He will tell you as clearly all about it as if he were present at the meeting; or to Mr. Hospital Clerk, or to our Wesleyan schoolmaster, who will be sure to tell you. But these are not all. He gives this book to any writer he chances to meet first—say to any one who will take little or nothing for doing it, and who, not being bound to secrecy, may show it to any of his friends. Thus the subject of our councils is universally known directly. But notwithstanding this assistance of the black young men to this man in making money, they are to him as vinegar is to the teeth: he hates them with an inveterate hatred.

For the latter appointment he is receiving a liberal salary, out of which he is paying a man 1l. 8s. per month. Thus, then, you see that our Government appointments are confined only to a few. It is with extreme regret that I have also to complain of our Colonial Hospital, to which, if a native who may have arrived but two days from the mainland be sent for medicine, or to remain there to receive medical attendance, it would be refused, although he might be dying. But I believe the reason is that the doctor has committed the charge of the hospital to a young man who was once cook\'s mate on board the Kelpie, and is now employed as Colonial Dispenser. On the 18th inst. a native gentleman, in conformity with a notice which has lately appeared to the public, that ""every person or persons who may require medicine should send to this department for the same with cash,"" sent to them for I don\'t know exactly what.

B. Sheridan, Member for Dudley, on the 22nd May, 1868, when Mr. Adderley stated—""That the charges in the petitions had been inquired into, and ascertained to be unfounded; and that the communication from Mr. Rainy had been inquired into and found not to contain facts."" The authority on which Mr. Adderley made this unqualified accusation against the petitioners and Mr. Rainy has not yet been fully exposed, but the day is fast approaching when the rottenness of that authority will be shown to the world, and when Mr. Adderley will be convinced how greatly he has been misled. We are persuaded that this question will never die out till the really shocking misdoings of Mr. Huggins, and his deception of the Colonial-office, are held up to public gaze in the same manner as the cruelties of Governor Eyre of Jamaica have been. He, too, for a long time hoodwinked the Colonial-office, and was covered by it as long as it was possible, but justice reached him at last, and Downing-street, finding him too heavy a load, threw him over. A similar fate is reserved for Mr. Huggins, however secure he may now deem himself. The matter was again brought before Parliament on the 27th of July, 1868, by the same honourable Member for Dudley, and again Mr. Adderley replied in the same manner as on the former occasion. In consequence of the discussions on the matter in the House, the Colonial-office condescended to reply to the petitions, and in a despatch dated 8th June, 1868, attempted to justify Mr. Huggins on the ground that the sentences he had passed were similar to those which had been passed by former judges of Sierra Leone. With all due deference to Colonial-office despatches, we must say that we conceive it impossible that the reason assigned in this one for exculpating Mr. Huggins can be regarded as a valid one. Because other judges passed illegal sentences and escaped impeachment, Mr. Huggins is justified in doing the same without being impeached! The petitioners, on receiving this extraordinary answer, addressed another petition to the Colonial office, in which they stated that Mr. Huggins had practised a very great deception on it, and showed that no judge of Sierra Leone had ever done what Mr. Huggins was charged with doing. In reply to this petition, in a despatch dated 26th February, 1869, the whole case was largely entered into, but Mr. Huggins had already been covered by the authorities, and it would not do to discard him now; he is still justified, but six of the sentences are condemned by Earl Granville as being unlawful. Meanwhile the petitioners were not idle, but addressed other petitions to the Colonial-office, in which they clearly set forth how completely Mr. Huggins had misled the Minister by wilful misrepresentations. One of the prisoners referred to in a petition, on whom Mr. Huggins had passed an unlawful sentence of whipping, for stealing a coat, a shirt, and a pair of trousers, without any previous conviction being set forth in the information exhibited against him or proved at his trial, brought an action against the tyrannical judge, who was put in the witness-box, and was, in fact, the principal witness examined in behalf of the plaintiff; and although every opportunity was given him at the trial to show by what law he passed this, as well as the other unlawful sentences complained of, yet he could not do so; an office copy of the evidence in the case was forwarded at once to the Colonial-office and to Mr. Sheridan by the plaintiff\'s counsel. Mr. Sheridan, being armed with this, and also with Earl Granville\'s despatch of the 26th February, 1869, in which six of the sentences were condemned as unlawful, brought the subject once more before the House of Commons in August last. The Colonial-office, on this occasion, found itself so sorely pressed that it was forced to promise that the entire matter should be referred to Governor Sir Arthur Kennedy, and pledged itself to lay the papers connected with the Huggins business on the table of the House of Commons after the termination of the inquiry. All this took place in August last. Here the matter rested; no official communication was made in reply to the petitioners, nor was an answer given to the communication of Thomas\'s counsel. But on the 11th April last, Mr. G. H. Moore came to the aid of the petitioners, and moved for the production of the papers which had been promised, when, to the surprise of every one (not that the papers were refused, for this was always expected by those who had watched the progress of affairs), the Under-Secretary urged that Sir Arthur Kennedy had held Mr. Huggins not blameworthy. There must be some mistake; no one here knows of any inquiries being made by Sir Arthur, nor is it here believed, either that Sir Arthur has undertaken to report that Mr. Huggins is not blameworthy, or that he even thinks that he is not blameworthy.'}, {'id': 1897, 'article_title': 'The Colonial-office and Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The Colonial-office and Administration of Justice on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': '09-23-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1870#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_09_1870', 'content': ""\n\nto protest and struggle against the wrong that has thus been committed, until that wrong shall have been redressed by the restoration of the jury-box in the courts of civil law; but our duty at the present time is with the action of the Colonial-office under that system of wrong which it has itself created. If, as happily is not the case, we had been forced by conclusive evidence to admit that there was some ground of justification for such system of wrong, we should nevertheless have expected that the Colonial-office would have been most jealously watchful that it did not aggravate that wrong by appointing and retaining in judicial and magisterial offices men justly obnoxious to those who had been despoiled of their long-enjoyed rights to intervene and decide as jurors in matters of complaint and dispute among their fellow-citizens and subjects. But it has long been too flagrantly glaring that, instead of any such jealous watchfulness for the people, there has only been watchfulness to support and uphold their nominees, even against the most just complaints. The continuance of Mr. Justice Huggins on the bench of the Supreme Court in Sierra Leone, against whom ten petitions to the Secretary of State have been forwarded, and there have been established in the judgment of every impartial man allegations and charges which should have caused his immediate removal from the exercise of any judicial functions in that settlement, is one, and a very flagrant, instance of this; and we have now to record what, in the absence of any published justifying grounds, seems to us another. Some six or eight months ago we gave some accounts of proceedings in the court of Chief Magistrate Way, at Lagos, in which his conduct and decision seem to have been so influenced by his sympathy for a European offender and against the injured African as to amount to a gross denial of justice. We were the more free in our remarks on the case because of a similar miscarriage of justice in the very gross crime of the European clerk, Lubley, against an African girl of only seven or eight years of age; and although we do not pretend that we may not sometimes be misled for a short time in our appreciation of certain facts by exaggeration or even falsehood, we were justified in believing that we were right on that occasion (the charges against Stott, master of the steamer, Thomas Bazley), not only by the evidence in our hands, but by the action of the Administrator of Lagos, Captain Glover, who suspended Mr. Way from any further exercise of his magisterial duties—a suspension which, of course not without examination of evidence, was approved and confirmed by the Governor-in-Chief. Under these circumstances Mr. Benjamin Way came to England, and the people of Lagos thought they were rid of him, until about a couple of months ago, when he reappeared in Lagos and resumed his office, under mandate from Downing-street, to the public astonishment and dismay. We enter our earnest protest against this unmerited official outrage to the public feeling of Lagos and official insult to Administrator Glover and Sir Arthur Kennedy, the Governor-in-Chief. We do not say that a suspension by them of a chief magistrate should and necessarily must, right or wrong, be confirmed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies; but we do say that so stinging a rebuke by the Colonial-office to such officials as the Governor-in-Chief and the Administrator of Lagos, as well as outrage to the people of Lagos, ought not to have been hazarded by the Colonial-office without a simultaneous public statement of the grounds on which they differed with the Governor-in-Chief and the Administrator and people of Lagos, and of the evidence, new perhaps, which made it indispensable in their eyes, as a matter of justice to the individual, to reinstate him in office, at the risk of lowering the prestige of Governor and Administrator with the people in all the West Coast Settlements. It may be necessary for Sir Arthur Kennedy and Captain Glover to pass this by in silence. The Colonial-office, though obstinate in the defence of their Coast officials, so long as they evince a due subserviency to that corrupt department of Her Majesty's Government, are not likely to tolerate any independent action on their part; and governors and administrators cannot be expected to ruin their future official prospects, by any prolonged opposition to Downing-street behests. We feel quite sure in our own minds that to such considerations as this, and to such only, we owe the absence of any open declaration of Sir Arthur Kennedy against the continuance of Mr. Justice Huggins as Judge in the Supreme Court at Sierra Leone. It is impossible that it can be otherwise. We do not believe that any two independent men of ordinary capacity out of the Colonial-office could differ as to the propriety of removing Mr. Justice Huggins to some other sphere of action, where he might have the chance of redeeming his reputation as a judge; but as the responsibility rests with the Colonial-office when they override the opinions and decisions of their governors and administrators on the Coast, we cannot be surprised that these yield to the power which made, and may unmake, them. And here it is, on occasions and in circumstances such as these, that an independent public press shows itself to be invaluable. We only bow to Colonial-office decisions when it is clearly evident that they are right and just. We know they are not right and just as regards Mr. Justice Huggins. We believe they are not right and just as regards Mr. Benjamin Way. It is not enough for us that the judge or the magistrate, or both, should have been gravely rebuked and admonished by the Colonial-office, if they are retained in power in those same localities in which their errors and offences were committed. Where a judge and a magistrate justly incur official rebuke and admonition, they ought to be held as having incurred the necessity of removal. We have not at any time a desire to ruin any man in his career; but we are bound to demand that the interests and welfare of the people and the settlements shall be held to be superior to those of the individual; and we therefore unhesitatingly say that Mr. Justice Huggins ought to be removed from Sierra Leone, and Mr. Benjamin Way from Lagos. In the absence of any such just regard for the feelings and interests of the people in Sierra Leone and Lagos as would be evinced by the removal of this judge and magistrate, we shall feel it our duty when Parliament reassembles (if, happily, the desolating war now waging between France and Germany be then terminated) to use all our efforts for obtaining the full consideration of these two cases of Mr. Justice Huggins and Mr. Benjamin Way in both Houses of the Imperial Legislature—the last resort of subjects wronged and injured by official error and injustice.""}, {'id': 1933, 'article_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'full_section_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'last_edit_date': '09-01-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_11_1870', 'content': 'I cited Mr. Collector Shaw in a former part of my letter in order to show what can be done here by officials; but, before dismissing the subject altogether, I think it well to give you their Lordships\' opinion of Mr. Shaw as expressed in the Privy Council by Lord Chief Justice Turner: ""Again, notwithstanding what is said by Shaw, we consider it to be sufficiently proved that it was customary to admit the importation of goods from vessels outside upon the payment of duties, and it is admitted by Shaw that he saw the vessels outside on the 12th. It is surely most improbable that he should have granted the permit on the evening of that day, should have received the report and entries on the following morning, and should even have allowed some of the goods to have been removed from the Custom House sheds on that morning, if he had then believed the vessel to be within the jurisdiction. Such conduct on his part goes far to show that he did not then entertain any such belief, whatever he may have thought afterwards.\n\n""The excuse which is made for this course of conduct on his part is that he was told that the goods came from Mellicoonie; but it is clear from the evidence that it was the custom to insert Mellicoonie and other places in the entries of the Custom House when the goods came from vessels outside; and we cannot readily believe Shaw to have been ignorant of this practice, to say nothing of there being two witnesses (Barlatt and Macrae) who distinctly state that they told him that the goods were coming from the vessel outside. There are also these further facts in favour of the appellant\'s case, that the character of the boats was of itself almost, if not fully, sufficient to show that the goods had not come from Mellicoonie; that no Custom House officer was put on board the Belus on the 13th, which, as we apprehend, would have been the ordinary, if not the necessary course, had she been within the jurisdiction; and that the monition was not issued till so long a time after the Belus had left the colony, and the appellants had lost the benefit of testimony which they might otherwise have been able to adduce.""\n\nIn the face of these damaging reflections on the conduct and character of Mr. Shaw, a council of officials, whose deliberations were conducted in secrecy, not only voted thousands of pounds to pay the damages and costs in which he was personally condemned by their lordships, but also sanctioned his being enrolled a member of the Council, at the nomination of Major Blackall, with the approval of the Colonial-office.'}, {'id': 2228, 'article_title': 'LAGOS AFFAIRS—PROHIBITION OF EXPORT OF ARMS ORDINANCE.', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS AFFAIRS—PROHIBITION OF EXPORT OF ARMS ORDINANCE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1872#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_05_1872', 'content': 'In other parts of this paper will be found copy of a letter addressed by us to Earl Kimberley on the reported stoppage of produce by the Egbas; as also a question on the same subject in the House of Commons by the hon. member for Birkenhead, and Mr. Hugessen\'s reply, ""It is not convenient at present to produce the correspondence.""

But this denial of placing official correspondence on such local matters before the House of Commons, which has now become a constant Colonial-office practice, is one that cannot be in any way justified; one that we protest against; and one that we shall make all possible effort to put an end to. It is so absurd that it will not bear examination, that in matters connected with small crown colonies and settlements such as those of West Africa, the Colonial-office should place itself on a par with the Foreign-office; and in matters which affect only the appreciation of conduct of a local administrator in his relations with the people over whom he rules, or the uncivilised countries adjoining, and which are alleged by the persons interested in the trade of the place to be most dangerous and disastrous to their legitimate pursuits, should be allowed to avail themselves of the same reasons for the non-production of papers, that the Foreign-office are allowed to plead regarding incomplete negotiations with powerful civilised states, which may possibly involve the peace of the world. It is, we repeat, ridiculous and unworthy a member of a British Administration, to place such a plea on record, in such a matter as whether there were sufficient grounds to justify Her Majesty\'s Government in permitting their servant at Lagos to endanger the prosperity of trade, in a place so entirely commercial, by such a course as he has of late pursued with regard to neighbouring native countries, on good accord with which the commercial prosperity of Lagos wholly depends. This denial of papers in such cases, possibly until after the erring local official shall have done irreparable injury, ruined the fortunes of many honest traders, and caused serious losses to those connected with them, is so great a grievance that we do not despair of getting it brought under the consideration of the Legislature, in a way that will lead to the adoption of some reasonable bounds for the practice, if not to its being got rid of altogether.

Better, then, to meet the foe, and perish, if unremembered, with the knowledge that we died fighting for our country, although we perished in a desperate and hopeless cause.\n\nBut again, Mr. Editor, are our merchants, European and native, who contribute the whole of our revenue, some of them their thousands annually, to be told that they are to receive no protection—that no real, physical protection will be given to them and their property for the large sums yearly taken out of their pockets, and placed at the disposal of the Government here, as they believe, for their benefit? Are they to be told that there is no protection for them, and that they must fight their own battles? And are we, the consumers of their importations, to be informed that there is no aid to be afforded us, and that the enemy may come and cut our throats at any moment, so long as the Government itself is not attacked by them? Can the majesty and might of England have fallen so low? Can that country—renowned for her triumphs, her arts, her civilization, for the bravery of her sons, for their enterprise, for the ready assistance that she has afforded in all ages to the weak against the strong—have become suddenly devoid of those principles which led her to her present eminence?

An open Council would mean business to be arranged in a secret session beforehand, and the public meeting would be simply to register foregone conclusions. We do want a Government Gazette that would publish a summary of the proceedings in the Council, with the text of any proposed laws, or new laws that are passed. There have been many new ordinances passed of late years that the public know nothing about, have never seen a copy of; there are not any copies printed. *Speramus meliora!* The first meeting I had with the natives of Bathurst was in 1875, relative to the proposed cession of the Gambia to France. I did my best to oppose such cession then. The second meeting was in July, 1876, to consider certain reforms, such as protection of trade in the River, reform of the engineer, sanitary, and other departments, repairs of streets and drains, the reclamation of the swamp at the back of the town, &c. The meeting separated without any discussion, so as to enable the Native Association to meet and consider the proposed reforms. The old and experienced members were in favour of them, but the younger members opposed them. A dispute arose which put a stop to all further action. Some time after other questions caused such divergence of opinion between the old members of the Native Association—men of property and position in Bathurst—and their younger countrymen, that the Association was dissolved. In 1876 I ascended the Gambia to about thirty miles above Barracoonda Rapids. I then proposed that trade should be opened from the head waters of this river to Sego, on the Niger, and with that scheme in view I remained in Gambia. I soon found that it would take time and much capital to organize such plans, and that to gain a proper knowledge of the people and the commerce of this part of North-West Africa was essential. I therefore went into the River trade, which, from the reasons I have already mentioned, has been a losing affair. However, had I been successful in opening trade to Sego, such loss would not have mattered. In 1879 I went to London, and, having got some capitalists there to adopt the scheme of trade from Gambia with the Upper Niger, starting from a depot at Yarbutenda, on the Upper Gambia, I laid the matter before the Secretary for the Colonies, asking no concession beyond free imports and exports at Yarbutenda for ten years, and that the Government would prevent foreign competition with our trade for that time. This was, in the end, refused. Had the Colonial officer granted to us then the tenth part of the privileges lately granted by Royal Charter by the Foreign Office to the recently incorporated North Borneo Company, trade would have been now well established with Sego, the French would have been forestalled in that city and the Upper Niger, the Galleini Treaty would never have been written, the new French posts of Bafoulabe and Kita would not have been built, England would have had a commercial treaty with the King of...\n**27**'}, {'id': 5568, 'article_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'full_section_title': 'Imperial Parliament', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1887#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_08_1887', 'content': ""Mr. Chance: What about Mr. Clifford Lloyd?\n\nMr. Hanbury: Does the right hon. gentleman think that full justice will be done by the mere announcement of his decision, and is there any precedent for a decision of this kind being arrived at _in camera_ by a Minister without full details being laid before the country?\n\nSir H.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Slavery and slave-dealing has been renewed under our rule on the Gold Coast.

This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.515, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

The letter No. 2,* if even only one-half of the statement it contains be correct, so aggravates the case of the impeached official body, that we seem to be left without even one of its members to whom we can look as free from complicity in the evil. And we cannot help feeling that this is a great misfortune, not only in a moral and administrative point of view, but also because the indirectly-impeached authorities have been called upon to report as to the truth of allegations which they can only report to be true by condemning themselves. For in the limited area of Cape Coast Castle and Town, everything that is done in or out of prison is known of all. There is no such thing as concealment possible. It was not only the business of the principal authorities to know what was being done by officials acting under their authority and control, but they could not have failed to know what was being done. And thus to have known, and to have permitted (if the charges be true), constitutes a veritable participation in what might and ought to have been prevented.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We never felt so deeply as now the weight of the work that we have undertaken, and the heavy load of responsibility that rests on us as the public guardians of the cause of humanity and progress in British Western Africa.

C. Finlason and others, the disgraceful condition of the places in which prisoners were confined at Cape Coast. The statements were of course denied, though every word of them was true; but as a speedy reform followed the exposure, and our bringing the matter, which we did, under the immediate attention of the Government, we were satisfied to allow the official abuse heaped upon us to remain unanswered, treating it with the contempt which alone it deserved. A subsequent exposure by us of malpractices in Bathurst Gaol led also to improvements there, amid showers of abuse on the offending Editor of the African Times. But now we feel as if we had been guilty of a dereliction of duty, although, of course, we can only expose those evils and abuses which are communicated to us, so in spite of all that rebuked officials say of us, we never invent grievances and abuses. Our invaluable co-operator, Mr. Rainy, has lately enabled us, by a letter of his, to bring the state of the Sierra Leone prisons under public notice. The fault there is the absence of classification, and the herding together of prisoners in a manner that can only lead to an increase of crime and a most vicious demoralisation. The evidence in the case of Joseph Gordon, which occupies so much space in our (this month enlarged) paper, shows that the reformed Bathurst Gaol is in need of many further reforms, among which must be placed the medical examination of every prisoner before he is set to work, the prohibition of punishments by mere verbal order of authorities, however exalted, and the making the visiting justices responsible for a due demand on the Executive for such clothing and bedding, &c., as are absolutely essential to the health of the prisoners. Last year we had to denounce the cells of Accra prisons, in which the life of poor Thomas Williams was so cruelly sacrificed—and the improvised powder-magazine dungeon in which it pleased Mr. Ussher, Mr. Parker, and Dr. Skues that poor Mr. Finlason should be tortured. And now again Cape Coast, that hotbed of all official abuses and mismanagement, iniquity, and oppression, crops up in a most offensive way. We had hoped that our former exposure of Cape Coast prisons, and it being known that we are never without correspondents in Cape Coast, would have insured the permanency of those sanitary reforms that ensued on our such former exposure; but we can only suppose that the virtual approval by the Colonial-office of all the official atrocities of Ussher, Parker, Skues and others by the promotion of Parker,—the whitewashing of Skues, whom, contrary to all reliable evidence, the Duke of Buckingham did not consider at all responsible for the death of poor Williams,—and the non-dismissal of Ussher and others from the service, has had the intelligible effect of inducing the present authorities there to believe that they may do whatever seemeth good in their own eyes, without fear of censure; and that to this is owing the state of the Cape Coast prison described in our last number. It is our duty to repeat it. Such a state of a Government prison is too shameful to allow of our passing it by with a mere condemnation of the atrocity of sending such a man as Mr. Lovell into it.

What we have heard from time to time of Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen has led us to entertain a high opinion of his character and abilities, and we may therefore be allowed at the very commencement of our observations on these revolting and disgraceful facts to express the hope that he will ""exercise, as regards them, a little ordinary intelligence,"" descend altogether from official stilts and from the clouds of Colonial-office obstinacy and indifference, and grapple with them, damning and distressing as they are, in a spirit of energy and determination that the name and rule of Great Britain shall not be thus disgraced with impunity in a British settlement. It is not a new thing for us to have to expose the illegal and atrocious barbarities of Gold Coast gaols within the British Protectorate. We have waged war with these abominations during many long years, sometimes with good results. But, alas, the Hydra has so many heads, that though one be cut off the deadly wound is healed at once by Colonial-office styptics and indifference, and the battle has to be begun anew. Of course we have been always wrong in official quarters—of course we have never exercised that ""little ordinary intelligence"" which should have convinced us that things were not that were. We do not complain of this; it is the usual fate of reformers of abuses, and we are as ready to encounter it again as we were when first we published the indignant denunciations by Finlason of the disgusting state of the prisons at Cape Coast and the infamous cruelties practised therein, when Mr. Richard Pine, lately rewarded with a pension, was Governor, and Mr. Michael Doorley his Inspector of Prisons; and as we were in our crusade in the cause of outraged humanity against Admiral Patey\'s shot-drill practice in Bathurst Gaol. But it is natural we should ask ourselves, when is there to be a permanent change for the better? when is illegality and cruelty to be put an end to in those British West African Settlements? We answer, instructed by the Past, Never, until the Colonial-office shows sufficient sense of what is due to the British name, as to punish swiftly and severely those who commit and permit them. When Mr. Finlason denounced the Cape Coast prisons, things were allowed to be made quite right for Mr. Pine and Mr. Doorley; when we rescued Finlason and the Bannermans from the official clutches in which they were on the point of perishing, especially the former, Mr. Parker was promoted to St. Helena, and Mr. Usher, after a lengthy stay in England, was allowed to resume his administration; when we showed how Mr. Acting Chief Justice Huggins, at Sierra Leone, had violated law and humanity in his criminal sentences (many of which the Colonial-office has since been compelled to admit were illegal), he was made a permanent Judge of the Supreme Court, and still remains there; when we exposed the shameful shot-drill practices in Bathurst Gaol, and Admiral Patey could no longer be kept at the Gambia, he, too, was promoted to St. Helena. What compensation has Mr. Lovell ever obtained for his incarceration in the filthy cells at Cape Coast, or what rebuke was ever administered to the unjust officials and the complacent magistrate by whom the outrage was perpetrated? None! Is it any wonder, then, that we have continually to begin our work anew? We are not surprised at it, although we do own to occasional discouragement in this task of continually rolling the stone up the hill, with but little, if any, assistance from those who will be most benefited by our success. But we have faith in the ultimate triumph of good and truth, and our shoulder or our hands are to the stone again. This new case is even worse than the old Bathurst one. Hereof a few words: ""A convict prisoner recently absconded from gaol and was recaptured. He was then flogged as a punishment for having run away, and while still suffering very severely from the effects of the flogging, he was put to shot-drill, during which he fainted. He was carried to the hospital, and there died in a shocking manner. An inquest was held, and it came out in evidence that the manner in which it has been customary to carry on prison discipline is extremely reprehensible, seeming to savour strongly of inhuman cruelty. Hitherto far too much power, irresponsible power, has been committed to the hands of heartless inspectors and brutish gaolers and turnkeys, &c., &c.""', 'last_edit_date': '1871-04-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1871#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE TORTURE SYSTEM IN CAPE COAST PRISON.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If there could have been a doubt remaining in any mind as to the necessity of such a journal as the African Times, we think it must have been removed by the letters which appear in this first number of our Fourth Volume, relative to the so-called ""Administration of Justice at Cape Coast.""

That confirmation we soon obtained. By this we do not mean a full confirmation of all there set forth, but of the alleged fact that prisoners are chained and otherwise ill-treated before trial, and have been also cruelly dealt with.

We can only answer such a doubt by referring to the minutes of the inquiry, published in our last, and reproducing here the able summary of Dr. Skues\' evidence before the said jury, made by that same Wm. Chas. Finlason, whom we were happily instrumental in snatching from the very jaws of death in a dungeon where he was under the government inspection and medical care of that same Doctor Skues.

The evils chiefly complained of are said to arise principally through the unfitness of the gaoler for the post he occupies. It is stated that the prisoners—both debtor and criminal (and all seem to us, by the account given, to be huddled together)—are always intending to report him to the Commandant; but that the Commandant had not, when our informant wrote, made any visit of inspection to the gaol for above two and a-half months. This is said to have given such a feeling of irresponsibility to the gaoler, that he has greatly abused his position, ordering and, above all, permitting things which reflect great disgrace on the authorities. Among other things, the water seems to be brought by convicts from Usher Fort for the supply of the prisoners; and the supply which ought to be for the use of the prisoners, is given away to friends of the gaoler, while the debtors and criminal prisoners are dying with thirst. The debtor prisoners, it is said, cannot get water to drink from the Government tank, but it has to be purchased by or for them, the charge being one shilling for a pot of good water and threepence for blackish; and that, as it is impossible they should continue to be thus supplied, either at their own expense or that of their creditors, it may be expected that they will, many of them, really perish through want of water, as they cannot, moreover, get any with which to wash themselves, which will certainly tend rapidly to loathsome sickness and death. Our informant asks whether, under the law of imprisonment for debt, it is intended that the debtors shall be brought into the gaol to be killed; or whether they are supposed to be lodged there in order to induce them to pay their debts? Criminal prisoners, who may be able to pay in money or rum, are further stated to be allowed the most shamefully licentious indulgencies. We must say that if a tithe of what our informant writes—details of which we cannot possibly give—be true, the negligence of the superior authorities has led to most cruel and disgraceful evils, which call for immediate action on the part of the Commandant; or, if he continue to neglect his duty in this respect, on the part of the Governor, Captain Strahan, who, as we have understood, effected a great reform in the Gaol of Lagos by his visits to that establishment and the abuses he there corrected. We are not dealing here with the question of imprisonment for debt; and it must not be for one moment considered, because we call for reform in the system of treatment of debtor prisoners, as well as that of criminal prisoners, that we have therefore fallen away from our often expressed conviction, that imprisonment for debt, as debt, is an abomination that ought not to be permitted longer to exist in any dependencies of the British Crown.

The Prisoner pleaded ""Not guilty."" He was defended by Mr. James Brew. The substance of the case was simply this: The prisoner was the Chief Landing Waiter of Her Majesty\'s Customs here. On Sunday, the 27th of October, the prisoner sent for his assistant, named Hilton, by a little boy of his. The boy did not see Hilton, but saw the deceased, Jim, who was servant to Hilton, and he delivered his message to the Krooboy that his master, Hagan, wanted Hilton. The Krooboy told him that his master was asleep, and he would not wake him. An altercation took place, in which the deceased Krooboy pushed Hagan\'s boy, and he returned back to his master crying; whereupon the prisoner Hagan at once, in a violent rage, which he always exhibited to the helpless and the weak, sent a big slave servant of his, named Hebbit, to go at once to fetch both Hilton and this poor Krooboy to him immediately, which he did. As soon as they entered his house, Hagan at once commenced, with a good-sized horsewhip, to flog and beat this poor Krooboy on the top of the stairs, and followed up the beating down the stairs whilst the Krooboy was trying to run away from him. In running down the steps his foot slipped, and he fell downstairs, and Hagan still continued to beat him unmercifully, till the boy\'s back and sides were cut open and blood gushing out freely. This outrage was done in the presence of Hilton, the Krooboy\'s master, on that holy day. Hilton asked Hagan, ""What has my boy done to you that you should give him such a beating?"" He replied, ""He assaulted my boy when I sent him to call you."" The Krooboy ran away to his countrymen and friends, and told them what Hegan had done to him, and told them that in falling downstairs he had hurt his ribs. Then he returned to his master\'s house, and told the same tale to Hilton\'s wife; and from that time the boy never ate anything, his appetite being gone. But Hilton was afraid that if he sent the Krooboy to the Colonial Hospital he should involve his superior officer. He therefore endeavoured to hide this matter from the authorities, and did his best to save Hagan, by sending him to fetch his meals to the beach the next morning and the following. On Wednesday he was worse; they tried to get him to eat, but he complained of pains in his side and chest, and yet no medical advice was given him. But on Wednesday evening, finding he was getting worse, Hilton\'s wife gave the boy some native medicine used for asthmatic complaints. About midnight of that day he called out to his master, and while his master held him he died. The next morning, Thursday, they found blood gushing out from his mouth and nose, and some other matter. Instead of Hilton reporting the matter to the District Commissioner, he went to Hagan, the prisoner, to tell him that the Krooboy was dead, meaning that his cruel act had taken effect, and asked what he should do. The result of that interview was, that this Krooboy was privately hurried to the grave; and this would have been the last of it.

This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

Uneven spread of education was, therefore, an important variable in the expression of African nationalism and anti-colonial politics. As European powers concentrated on making colonies pay for their administration and services, relatively little was done to spread western education and provide infrastructure for political and social development. In several areas of colonized Africa between the two world wars, primary schools were still few and far between and secondary education was a rarity. In British Central Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Soudan and Portuguese Angola, Mozambique and Guinea, there was practically no access to secondary education before the Second World War.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""However, the movement gained momentum, inspired by African intel› lectuals whom the Colonial Office described even in 1855 as a half-civilized intermediary class with ideas acquired from missionaries and others.

Only by uniting will you gain access to your rights'. Such were the ideas of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean, Joseph Smith, Henry Barnes, T. Hughes, F. L. Grant and R. J. Ghartey. Under the circumstances the coastal chiefs were very open to such arguments. They dreaded being attacked again by the Asante and were determined to contribute to their own defence, but they disapproved of the flabby attitude of the Dutch to Kumasi and its coastal ally, Elmina. They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous. However, they were also afraid of being abandoned by the British, who pressed them to unite against Asante in defence of the coast, but did not intend to give them the means to do so.

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation. In the Akan regions they had to ensure that disputes were settled by enforcing observance of the Asantehene's oath so as to emphasize his sovereignty over these territories. The collection of taxes in these regions, seen by contemporary European ii. Cf. R.S. Rattray, 1929, pp. 398-409; K.A. Busia, 1951; I. Wilks, 1975, ch. 2. observers as a form of exploitation, was no problem for the Asantehene, since Asante states themselves had to bear the same burdens.15 The real problem was territorial sovereignty. In non-Akan regions, the com¬ missioners strove to strengthen the terms of the 'treaty' between the Asantehene and the Dagomba, for example,16 concerning the tribute. On the other hand, we have no evidence confirming the presence of Gonja or Dagomba contingents in the Asante army or of payment by these countries of the Asante war tax (apeatoo). The settlement of the Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes must therefore be considered as a political act with economic motives: peace in these territories guaranteed payment of the tribute, as well as the introduction of Asante institutions into the Dagomba army.

We cannot imagine a greater curse to any community than the existence among them of a class of poor, greedy, and almost necessarily subservient, legal men. We presume they would be poor men, because it cannot be proposed to send sons of the more opulent natives to England for legal training at the public expense, such a course being at the same time unjust to the taxpayers and unnecessary. There is now sufficient wealth among the native traders and merchants at Sierra Leone, Lagos, and wherever lawyers are required, to admit of their sending sons to England for legal education, so that there is no such necessity as could alone justify burdening the meagre revenues of the colonies with expenses for such a purpose.

Short of Christianity, no subject is more intimately connected with the welfare of a subject or a protected people than that of their education, and yet there is not one that the Government has so much neglected in its West African settlements. The work of educating the people has been relegated entirely to Christian Missionary Societies. It cannot be that the Government is of opinion that African races are not capable of mental improvement and development, or that they do not need it, and that its government over those entrusted to it should simply be that of a police force for the preservation of order. If this is not its opinion, it is difficult to understand its policy. Whatever may be the ultimate intention for which it holds its settlements on the Coast—whether it be to make them eventually independent and self-governing, or to make them always appendages to the British territory—there is an obligation on its part to furnish them with the means of a liberal education, especially when they are not themselves in a position so to do, so that they may properly discharge their own obligations and answer the end of their existence. They have responsibilities which they cannot discharge without education. These settlements were acquired, and the position held by the Government secured, with the constantly avowed object of thereby aiding to suppress the slave-trade and correct the many untold evils it has inflicted upon Africa, and of making them renovating centres for Western Africa. The object is noble and laudable; but, I ask, what has the Government done to compass this end? What amount of education has it given to the people? For ignorance is as much a hindrance and weakens as education of the right sort is power, and progress. The development of the capabilities of the mind is a power of no little magnitude for developing the resources of a country that is poor and low in the midst of an abundance of the elements of wealth and greatness. The people should be educated to a strong sense of their privileges, duties, and responsibilities. Why is it, then, that the Government has all along neglected this duty, when it stands in loco parenta to these settlements? or has it no faith in the power of education? But for the Missionary Societies, and particularly the Church Missionary Society, which have established themselves in them, these settlements would not have been worth their present value. The efforts made by Government to educate have been very feeble; it has not convinced the people of its earnestness on the subject. I am one of those who think that the funds of Missionary Societies are sacred, and should be employed solely for the work of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It is for this object they appeal to their friends for support constantly; it is not theirs to establish abroad schools of learning. If educational work is done by them, it should not generally exceed the barely elementary one which would enable converts to read the Scriptures for themselves, and that of raising up native missionaries and pastors to enforce on the people the truths they read. It is all the more necessary that this should be the case, because the area of ground to be covered in heathendom is large, and the funds of great missionary societies have not for many years now shown a large and steady increase. The claims upon them are many and urgent, and in some places there are doors of usefulness open to them already which they are urgently invited to occupy. Now, can they do this with an almost limited income if they must spend a considerable portion of it upon educational work?', 'last_edit_date': '1875-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Expedition against Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That the Local Government believe more in police and gaols, as you have observed, than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education, is self-evident; for whereas several thousands of pounds are annually voted to the former and expended, the few hundred pounds voted to the latter are doled out so niggardly and irregularly, that it seems almost a matter of regret an ordinance was ever passed in its favour.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I consider that, as far as may be expected of Missionary Societies, they have been liberal in their efforts to educate the people in some parts of the Coast, and particularly in Sierra Leone, where, besides the Missionary Colleges of the Church Missionary Society and the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the former has had a public Grammar School since 1845, and a Female Institution which is nearly as old, if not older, and training masters from England.

The Government holds a position on the Gold Coast; this position is enhanced, and its responsibility increased, by the Act which has recently liberated hundreds of thousands of slaves from bondage, or at least placed them on the way to claim their freedom. Untold blessings to the Coast and the interior of Africa will, I expect, result from it if the efforts to discharge duties and responsibilities are of the right kind, and are properly directed.

The Local Government believe more in police and gaols than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education. We say “religious education,” because all education for a long time to come must embrace the religious element, since all the teachers capable of imparting instruction have been educated by one or other of our great Missionary Societies. And well for Africa that it must do so; for education merely secular—education without any attempt to impart with it the restraining influences of Christianity—would curse at least as much as it would bless. Among older communities, the control of public opinion, the existence of a higher moral standard, the general outward profession of religion, may—we do not say they will, but they may—prevent mere secular instruction in schools, to the exclusion of the religious element, from producing those pernicious results which would otherwise most certainly accrue. But in West Africa, among people but lately redeemed from barbarism, and surrounded by a heathen population debased by the most loathsome superstitions and most revolting practices, the results of mere secular education could not be other than deplorable. The old leaven, we have said, still works strongly among the members of the Local Government. The account given on our second page affords sufficient evidence of this. We are glad to have been furnished by it with this opportunity of bringing so important a matter under the notice of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, whom we know to be especially desirous of extending the ameliorating influences of education among the people of West Africa.

The results produced by a first lesson as to the danger of approaching British troops armed with the awfully effective weapons which science has now devised for mutual destruction amongst civilized nations, were improved so soon as an unusually protracted wet season would permit, by offensive movements against the Ashanti enemy, which eventuated in the abandonment of the Protectorate by a miserable remnant of the host which, but a few short months before, had overrun it in ruthless pride. The elements had fought against the invaders, as well as against the homeless masses whose habitations and food supplies they had destroyed. Small-pox of a most infectious type, dysentery, and fever had caused the deaths of above twenty thousand Ashantees. And now the white men, whose look was death, were upon them; and all who had strength to reach the Prah and cross it, did so. This deliverance of the Protectorate was thus accomplished without the Ashantees being really brought into hostile contact with more than some five or six hundred Europeans. But this deliverance was accompanied also by other agencies calculated to produce future good results. Public attention in England was in some small degree directed to those countries, the mere name of which was all that was generally known about them. A small but effective British force was to be sent out from England; a force consisting of some of our most renowned regiments. The daily and the pictorial press must necessarily be represented in the expedition by men of tried ability, who should furnish to the British public detailed accounts of all they should see and hear. By their aid, the Gold Coast countries have had withdrawn from them that veil of ignorance which had hitherto concealed them and their people from the knowledge of the civilized world. True, the reports have not been such as to create any impressions favourable to the Fanti people. It is not our intention here to show (as we intend sooner or later to do) that many of the conclusions of an unfavourable nature, seemingly justified by daily events, were not altogether correct. The change lately recorded in their favour, as regards the Transport Service, since that service has been properly organized, and the men have been looked upon as human beings, and not as mere beasts of burden, has in part removed the odium. But whatever the opinion entertained respecting them, they cannot any more be relegated to the indifference hitherto entertained. Their deliverance from the Ashantee enemy will have cost Great Britain, it may be, one million sterling. The British nation knows as a nation the condition of people in sea-coast towns where the British flag has waved in supremacy for half a century; and the British commerce will not any longer permit people and country over which that flag thus floats, to remain in that state of barbarian filth and at a donment which has up to the present time prevailed. Now, this is a good and a great good, which would not have been effected had the King of Askim been so supported in the first instance, and the united Fantee tribes later, as to have enabled them to clear the country of the invader, without the intervention of a real British force. The British Government will be compelled to one of two courses. Either it must abandon those countries, which will be the signal for their being taken possession of by some other European power, to our great and indelible disgrace; or the British rule must be made effective, and the agencies of civilization be brought to bear effectually on them and on their people. From the first moment of expressed intention to roll back the tide of invasion by British troops, and to punish the wanton aggressor in his own land, it was admitted that the question of supply was the great question to be solved. On this the health and efficiency of the troops must mainly depend. And here the neglect of so many years—neglect against which we had so often protested in vain—rose up in judgment against the British Executive. That question has been solved; with difficulty, a route has been opened to the Ashanti frontier, over which supplies can be carried with no other difficulty than that of their conveyance for so many miles on the heads of human beings. Is it too much to say that that route cannot be allowed ever again to be closed up by the impenetrable bush; that, on the contrary, it must and will be made a solid and permanent highway to the interior for trade and commerce to pass over? We hope it is not too much to say this; and therefore, here again, the present is full of promise. Again, admitting that the Ashanti power was in itself a formidable one, there can be no doubt that much of its prestige, much of the dread with which it was regarded, was owing to the little real information that could be obtained respecting it. From the outset we expressed the conviction that the hostile touch of civilized power, like that of Great Britain, would dispel a great illusion, or destroy even a great fact. In one of the extracts from correspondence, which we insert elsewhere, an opinion will be found expressed, that even though we had not followed up the Ashantees into their own territory, they would have been deterred by their great losses from any further invasion for at least some fifty years. But we do not feel certain of this; and even had it been so, the destructive prestige of their superior prowess would have been heavily weighing on the Coast districts. This is now for ever at an end. The present advance on Kumasi is not by European troops only. Wood and Russell's native regiments, the Akim contingent—the Houssas, Yorubas, and other Africans under Captain Glover, are among the invaders—will be among the temporary occupiers of that city of blood, that human shambles—the capital of Ashanti. The native contingents, acting with the 23rd, the Rifles, and the 42nd, will have seen that fetish charms are powerless against brave men with good weapons in their hands, whether those men be Europeans or Africans; no mist of ignorance will rest any more over the Ashanti countries; no prestige of invulnerability will defend the Ashantees and their capital. The Ashanti pride will also be humbled. Ashanti kings will recognize that they have nothing to gain on the side of the sea-coast territories, save those supplies which they may be able to purchase there from a friendly people. All this promises well for the future. But we look for more than this influence of accomplished events. We look also for the influence of positive stipulations—of conditions imposed by the civilized conqueror on the vanquished barbarian. We look for constant free access from the sea-coast to Kumasi, and to all parts of the Ashanti territory. We look for permission for missionaries to preach the everlasting Gospel of peace there. We look for an entire discontinuance of those horrible human sacrifices which have made Kumasi a name of loathing and abhorrence. We look for the liberty of exploration, by which, directly or indirectly, sooner or later, those great gold deposits which the Kong Mountains undoubtedly contain, shall be utilized for the convenience and benefit of the civilized world. Yes; the past, the present, and the future of this Ashanti War must all combine for great and permanent results, among which will, undoubtedly, be the elevation of the Fantees, and other coast tribes, from that condition of filthy barbarism which makes them at this time a reproach to the civilized protecting power. It has become evident that, if left to their own devices, they would remain from century to century in that disgusting condition which has so horrified the numerous Europeans whom this war has forced to become temporary residents at Cape Coast and Accra. For their own good, as well as for the good of others, they must be forced out of it, by introducing—compulsorily, if necessary—those sanitary laws and regulations, and that public order through the bridling of private licence, which are among the first essentials of progress. The Ashanti invasion has been a terrible scourge—the Ashanti war has been a mighty awakening; and the direct and indirect regenerating influences of both will be such as will make both the invasion and the war most memorable in the history of Western Africa."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letter from Kpong', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Alas, dear Mr. Editor!

No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)\nMost of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies. Construction of the first railway in British West Africa took place in Sierra Leone during the 1890s. The first train started operating in the colony area in 1897, and by 1909 the main line, crossing the rich palm oil belt to Pendembu, in the east (365 km) had been completed. A branch line from Bubuyan to Makeni in the north (132 km) was opened in 1915. Soon after the work started in Sierra Leone, other dependencies followed her example with even better results. All major lines were built by 1920. In Tanganyika the British inherited the two railways constructed by the Germans earlier during the twentieth century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.526, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""All these guiding principles were made clear, explicitly or implicitly, to the colonial administrators.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations.

To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit. With the small amounts of capital they had brought from Britain rapidly dwindling, many were either heavily in debt to the government for rations or were facing destitution. Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting.

If anything, their gentle and almost timid-looking faces, and the fact that most of them had lost their cohesion and group loyalty encouraged the colonists to think that the Sotho and Tswana refugees would make 'docile and willing servants'$^{16}$ and satisfy one of the Colony's most critical wants. This assumption was correct, as gradually the destructive effects of the Mfecane in the interior were proving to be extremely beneficial to the Cape Colony.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals.

Large numbers of peasants fled from Katanga and Kasai provinces to avoid the agents working for the Bourse du Travail de Katanga (BTK), the industrial labour bureau that recruited and distributed workers within Katanga. Still others escaped shortly after their arrival at the mines. As early as 1914 desertion had become such a serious problem that the BTK introduced a pass system and a finger-printing bureau to trace 'fugitives'.$^{5}$ ' Despite such coercive tactics, desertion continued to be prevalent.

Although desertion declined somewhat in the 1920s, it continued to run at between 20 and 35% up until the Great Depression, when the lack of alternative sources of income made such a strategy counterproductive. 52 While thousands fled from the mines, others in Katanga began to organize, albeit in the most tentative and sporadic fashion, in order to improve the conditions of their employment. In 1921, a large number of miners at Luishi, for example, walked off the job and proceeded to Elizabeth ville to complain to government officials of ill-treatment and poor rations. Two years later a similar work stoppage occurred at the Kakontwe mines. 53 The Depression created new economic uncertainties.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

The same practice is found to prevail in all of them, with some exception as regards Lagos, where works of public utility have been allowed a share. There is the same squandering of the public money upon official favourites everywhere, and everywhere an almost total neglect of those matters upon which the progress of towns, and districts, and countries depend. But for the present we will take Bathurst. Look at Bathurst. The imposts on trade and commerce have been, within the last three years, most prejudicially increased because of former lavish extravagance. The revenue must be above 20,000l. a-year. The colonial steamer for protecting and assisting trade up the Gambia, which formerly absorbed some 5,000l. a-year, has disappeared from the estimates and from river navigation, and what is being done with the money? In March last we were called upon to notice that, although the revenue has for many years past fluctuated between 15,000l. and 20,000l. a-year, not even a fire-engine has been provided for the town of Bathurst, so that when a fire breaks out in any of the native habitations, there are none of the means used in civilised countries for arresting its progress; there is a general danger, and much loss and privation is the result. In our June number an intelligent correspondent says that on all sides there is deterioration and no renewal—the sea-wall has been allowed to go out of repair, the roads are neglected and have become almost useless; while the writer of another letter in the same number inquires why such and such houses are hired by the local authorities unnecessarily at a great expense of public money, and only for the advantage and profit of some favoured individuals. It is from beginning to end a system of waste. There is so much a-year to be spent, and the question has been, not how much good may be effected for the Colony with it, but who is to have a share in it? Is it not shameful? Is it any wonder that the people complain? Little or nothing done for education; nothing for the assistance or protection of trade on the river; no bridge built over Oyster Creek, so that there may be always an open road into the healthy districts of British Combo;* not even a fire-engine to save the houses of the poor people from destruction; sea-wall out of repair, and roads neglected. We only give these as a sample of the really vital necessities that are not attended to, while what is amply sufficient for these purposes is uselessly squandered in other directions where it only benefits unjustly a few favoured individuals. Do not let us be misunderstood. We do not accuse the present chief local authority, the present Administrator, of squandering the revenue by any acts of favouritism. The worst we should say of him is that he allows the continuance of abuses scandalously perpetrated by others, such as the rental of the houses mentioned by ""Public Interest"" in our June number. Rather, the complaint made against Admiral Patey is, that having succeeded in getting a large sum into the colonial chest, he is not willing to expend any of it even on those most indispensable works—roads, bridges, and sea-wall.† For a moment there is a fit of official parsimony, and the misapplication consists in shutting that money up in the chest in useless inactivity, which ought to be made the instrument of present and future good to the colony. We venture to call the serious attention of the Administrator, Admiral Patey, to these things. Why should he not make his administration memorable on the Gambia by the correction of old abuses, and the application of some portion of the surplus funds he so happily possesses, on objects that will bring him thanks and blessings from a grateful people. Let him begin by importing that most necessary adjunct of civilisation, a fire-engine; and then form a volunteer fire brigade; teaching the natives how they may most usefully employ themselves in extinguishing a conflagration. We really long for the opportunity of praising Admiral Patey or some other of our West Coast administrators. We have volumes of laudation ready for them if they will only give us proper occasion for using it, for the fact is they have afforded us so little chance of applying any portion of it during the past eight years, that the accumulation on hand is quite embarrassing. We should like to see a healthy emulation among them as to who should establish a claim to the largest portion of it.

This indifference and neglect, which we feel justified in designating criminal, not only interferes with the progress of civilization, but subjects the community, both European and native, to renewed outbreaks of those destroying pestilences which have from time to time decimated the town of Bathurst. Year after year the educated native inhabitants, as well as Europeans, have protested against the continued permission by the authorities to the natives from the river villages who flock to Bathurst for trade, to perambulate the town in a state of nudity, and perform all the operations of nature when and where they choose, without the slightest regard to decency, and in defiance of all sanitary regulations which ought to be enforced in any town under British rule and law. We are at a loss to understand why such things should be—why British officials should continue to tolerate them, as if a decree had gone forth that it was not desirable that the blessings of civilization should extend in Africa. Bathurst, and all other towns on the Coast under British government, ought to be brought fully under civilized regulations, and become spots from which civilization should radiate into the neighbouring territories. That they should not be this, is a gross neglect of duty on the part of the authorities, and reflects deep disgrace on Great Britain. It is absurd to suppose that there could be any real difficulty in insisting upon public decency within the town of Bathurst. While the unclothed natives from the river villages are allowed to come into the town in their unclothed condition, and treat the town in every way as if it were the bush or fields in which they reside, they will no doubt continue to do so, and look with ignorant and barbarous contempt upon the inhabitants who are not permitted, and would no longer permit themselves, the offensive freedom from all self-restraint which they, the ""untutored savages,"" enjoy. Is it too much to expect that British authority will now at last interfere on the side of decency and health? The ""untutored savage"" would not forego the substantial benefits he or she derives from his or her visits to Bathurst because compelled to wear a proper cloth and conform to certain sanitary regulations; and, accustomed to these self-restraints within the town of Bathurst, they will thus have entered, however superficially, into the arena of civilization, and become more accessible to the propaganda of civilization among themselves. Important, however, as this change for which we call would really prove to be, it is but secondary when viewed in connection with that continued neglect of the drains, and that continuous horrible condition of the place of sepulture, respecting which the Memorialists protest. Everyone who has watched and recorded the ravages of epidemics on the West Coast of Africa must remember but too well the awful visitations to which Bathurst has been subject. Only last year it was threatened with one of them, and not a few persons perished from its advancing breath, when, happily, a sudden meteorological change drove back the fearful enemy. In some of our letters we find fears expressed that the present season may be rather an unhealthy one on the West Coast, and the mere suspicion that it will be so ought to induce precaution on the part of individuals and authorities. The latter are to a certain extent answerable for the lives of the population over whom they rule; they are fully answerable to the extent of removable causes; and among removable causes, that of pestilential drains, of filthy thoroughfares, and of graveyards in which the decaying dead are exposed to public view, filling the atmosphere with poisonous gases, must certainly be included. By the time this number of our journal reaches Bathurst the fiend of pestilence may—though we fervently pray it will not—may, we say, be upon the town.

During the spring tide of last year, the local government felt itself compelled, perhaps for its own safety, to proclaim that those of your Excellency's memorialists whose relations' coffins were exhumed by water should look after their dead, no precaution whatever having been taken to preserve the remains of those for whose memory your Excellency's memorialists cherish the highest respect in God's acre. A mock attempt to keep away the water by Mr. Bauer, the engineer, whose signal failure your Excellency's memorialists are willing to attribute to the parsimony of the government, which endeavoured to make use of mangrove and empty barrels to stop the sea encroachments, instead of erecting substantial dykes, or embankments for the purpose. The safety of the people could hardly have been in contemplation of the government, or steps in the right direction might have been taken to bring about this desirable end.\n\n7. Gutters are urgently needed at Half Die. The streets in that part of the town are literally overflowed with water, on the subsidence of which a very sickening smell is produced by the filth generated by fecal matters, whose decomposition is accelerated by stagnant waters. The construction of sewers would drain off those offensive matters, and render the atmosphere pure and wholesome.\n\n8. Dry earth closets are in great demand in this settlement. The expense of erecting these is trifling when compared with the beneficial results that would flow from them. Strangers visiting these shores very often find themselves obliged to attend to the calls of nature, in places where a sense of decency should deter them from using. The reason for this is to be found in the want of public closets. Regret is often expressed at the unhealthiness of Bathurst, which is to a great extent enhanced by the filthy habits of Mandingoes, and other aboriginal tribes who come to Bathurst for trading purposes. The erection of these closets, in various parts of the town, would lessen the unhealthiness produced by the stench emanating from the excrements and nuisances of the tribes alluded to. *Your Excellency's memorialists humbly solicit that an ordinance be passed declaring it unlawful for Jolahs, Sereres, and others to walk the streets stark naked.*\n\n9. In connection with the matter lastly herein above alluded to, may be mentioned the desirability of appointing a sanitary inspector or water police, whose duty should be to prevent the sick that are brought from the rivers, and foreign places, being thrown on the wharves to take care of themselves, or die.

We wondered what that was, and were told that it was a substitute for a lighthouse, and a miserable one it was. Our vessel suddenly came to anchor, to our great surprise, as we had intended to have a jolly good turn out on shore, and on inquiry we were told that the pilots would not conduct vessels to their safe anchorage in this intricate river at night. We grumbled and stamped our feet, but were obliged to succumb to the will of the pilate, and remained. Before break of day, however, steam was again up, and we were introduced, through deep channel by uncertain turnings amongst the sandbanks on the mouth of the river, to the anchorage opposite Bathurst.\n\nIt was in the rainy season of August, 1856, that I thus first visited St. Mary's. The night before there had been heavy rain. The appearance of the front buildings was indeed picturesque, white houses beautifully laid out, peeping through a row of bushy trees, unlike Sierra Leone, where the backs of the houses fronting the sea are in a demi-semi state of dilapidation, a standing disgrace to the colony. The frontage houses in the Gambia are in perfect harmony with each other, substantially built, and in very good condition. Through the kindness of our polite captain, I had an easy row in one of the ship's boats to the shore. I was a perfect stranger to the place, and my companions and myself intended to have a regular déjeuner in the hotel. We stood for a long time in the front street, which was in excellent condition, and I was surprised to find lamps hanging by ropes on trees all along the streets. On inquiry we found that there was no hotel, and no place of accommodation; and therefore, after a brief consultation with my companions, we agreed to make a regular inspection of the town. The condition of the back streets produced a rather unfavourable impression, those especially in the soldiers' and the Mohammedan town were in a state of swamp and dirt; there was very little drainage, the streets were covered with water knee-deep, and, as I was told by our guide, visiting from one house to the other was most difficult in some parts; in fact, he repeated the antiquated story that at times some of the people were obliged to visit by canoe; but this statement, in my second visit of 1864, I heard indignantly denied by natives of the Gambia, and from their countenances read that it was the production of an over-heated imagination."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Island of M'Carthy, about 150 miles up the river, is occupied as an advanced post for the protection of trade in its neighbourhood; its establishment usually consists of a commandant, who acts as magistrate, and is generally the military officer in command, of two assistant-surgeons and about thirty men.

I made another trip in July, 1864, during a season which all ground-nut traders called good, as the rains were plentiful, and there was every prospect of a good crop. I was surprised to see large and well-regulated drains made or making in almost every part where I went, walled on either side with stone or bricks—running from one side of the town to the other, and emptying into the sea. A great many were in an imperfect state, some of which were interrupted by the approach of the rainy season.\n\nIt was pleasant to see fine squares in the middle of the town, all covered with the green Bahama grass, and some of the drains supplied with railings. It struck me at once that there was a wonderful change in the interior of Bathurst since I last had seen it. There were good bridges in the centres of the streets, where in 1855 I had to walk knee deep in water. There was no more an inundation from the muddy swamp at the back and left of the town, a proper sea embankment having been made by the present Governor, which led to the securing of a large tract of land from the water. This land has been a great source of revenue to the Colonial Government, as it was afterwards divided into lots, and sold at a very advantageous rate, bringing over 600l. to the colonial coffers. The road to the burial-ground, which was in a fearful state of swamp, and in many parts covered over with water, is now converted into a hard road, and forms a pleasurable walk.\n\nAt this visit I rode to the cape. It is a distance of about seven miles. The road from St. Mary's to the ferry was excellent and hard—a good carriage drive. The boat employed in the ferry is an antiquated piece of workmanship, perhaps about fifty or a hundred years old, of an American origin, equally broad in stern and bow, and worked by paddles manned by four men. Sometimes the boat is drifted about 300 yards beyond its landing-place. I have never seen such an ugly piece of mechanism, and it is tiresome to see the poor men labouring to make this huge log move; and although it is said that the colony is in a state of bankruptcy, I hope they will soon be able to replace it with something more modern and workable. The road from the ferry to the cape is partly good and partly bad, the latter portion being rapidly repairing by the civilian prisoners. The material used by the Governor is the shell of the common cockle, mixed with those of other gregarious mollusks.\n\nAll along the road are large Bombax, or monkey bread trees, and I noticed hollows scraped out of a great many of them; and on inquiry I was told that they were so ordered to be done by the Governor, to form rests for the women who carry loads on their heads."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REPORT TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR THE GAMBIA ON DYKES AND DRAINS', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Island of St. Mary's much resembles in formation the parallel ruler employed by navigators when pricking their charts; the right ruler represents the strip of sand on which Wellington-street, Government House, and the two hospitals are built, and the left ruler shows Soldier Town.

The early settlers, observing the set of the tides, found it the best plan, when they relinquished their proposed canal, and followed the natural highway, only to convert the creek into a drain, by importing earth from the mainland, to wall up the creek, confining the water to a narrow deep space, instead of allowing it gently to ebb over a large space. At one time, indeed, I thought the drainage of the island was constructed altogether on a false principle, trying to make water run up hill; but I now see that the system of double drainage is the best that could be adopted, when the artificial formation of part of the island had to be taken in consideration. The racecourse, or left ruler, drains to the Pontine Marsh, and to the river round by Arrafal's Creek and the right parallelogram of sandbank drains to the sea by cutting through the bank on which stands Wellington-street, and making an artificial level protected by sluice-gates; for if all the rain and sea water were allowed to flow to the Pontine Marsh, the accumulation at high tides would be too great, swamping the inhabitants of Perseverance-street and a great part of Soldier Town, and probably the weight would be too much for the present gates at the Box Bar."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of the Report of Col.

Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere. It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year. Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola', 'content': 'The latter tried on many occasions to rise up against metropolitan rule (especially in 1924-5), and subsequently against the dictatorial regime (notably in 1930), but these attempts only indirectly affected the oppressed African population.$^{77}$ Africans had become foreigners in their own country and their only apparent function in the eyes of the Europeans was their productive capacity.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In North Africa, it was only Algeria that had by 1880 been colonized by the French. Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1).

But, on the eve of the imposition of European colonial rule, there was no direct alien control of everyday economic activity on African soil. Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

As early as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the states of Africa such as Benin and the Congo could send embassies and missions to the courts of European kings. Even until as late as the 1890s, as we have seen already, some African states could deal with their European counterparts as equals. The Asantehene, the King of Matabeleland and the Queen of Madagascar sent diplomatic missions to the Queen of England in the 1890s. Colonialism put an end to this and thereby deprived African states of the opportunity of acquiring experience in the conduct of inter› national relations and diplomacy.\nBut the loss of independence and sovereignty meant far more to Africans than this. It meant, above all, the loss of their right to control their own destiny, plan their own development, manage their economy, determine their own strategies and priorities, borrow freely from the outside world at large the latest and most appropriate technology, and generally manage or even mismanage their own affairs and derive inspiration and a sense of fulfilment from their successes, and lessons and experience from their failures. In short, colonialism deprived Africans of one of the most fundamental and inalienable rights of a people, the right of liberty.\nMoreover, as Rodney has shown, the seventy-year period of colonialism in Africa was the very period which witnessed tremendous and decisive developments and changes in both the capitalist and socialist countries. It was that period, for instance, that saw the entry of Europe into the nuclear age and the age of the aeroplane and the motor vehicle. Had Africa been in control of her own destiny, she could have benefited from or even been part of these phenomenal changes. But colonialism completely isolated and insulated her from these changes and kept her in a position of dependency.

But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies. At the same time, the pauperizing exactions made against the colonized became greater with higher taxes, frequent use of cheap and forced labour, in a situation in which farmers were receiving diminishing returns for their raw materials while paying higher prices for imported European manufactures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off.

Just look at this. Admiral Patey is not only Administrator, but is also Collector of Customs, Cashier, Colonial Treasurer, &c., &c. If he were a capable man perhaps this might pass, but I do not believe that he has the slightest idea of checking or examining the public accounts. The young men managing the different branches of the public service pay into his hands therefore just what money they please. It is only to be hoped that they are all incapable of error as well as of any purposed fraud, but taxpayers think there ought to be some efficient check. Mr. Kneller, the Collector of Customs, left by the April packet on sick leave; Admiral Patey of course succeeded to the office; now Admiral Patey is to go to England—doctors say he must or he will die here—and in his absence the Collector of Customs ought to be Acting Administrator; but as he is away, who is to be Administrator in the absence of both these luminaries? Perhaps ""Soapy Sam,"" who has only just landed, has come up to set this matter right.\n\nYou have often before exposed the deplorable state of affairs in our Post-office—but, alas! we have no redress. Our papers are lost as heretofore; in fact, this has become so common, people cease to talk about it; there is nothing for us seemingly but to ""grin and bear;"" but there is a great public wrong in the Post-office being in its present hands. The Postmaster, who has become a pet of Admiral Patey\'s, is also Acting Clerk of Courts (the Clerk of Courts being a fiction), Clerk of the Crown, and is to be Colonial Auditor, &c. Now he has been in business, he has failed, has compounded with his creditors—but not paid them the composition—he is still trading, yet he has charge of the money order department, receives money here, gives orders, may or may not trade with the money, has not given, and cannot give any security. Can you wonder that, as the taxpayers are responsible, and would have to pay should there be any loss or defalcation, there should be some uneasiness and grumbling about it? Your comic paper _Punch_ comes out here, and I get a look at it sometimes. I remember his saying that when a man has proved himself utterly incapable for everything else, he has established his fitness for a Government situation. We have pretty good proof here always, from Governor-General downwards, of the correctness of Mr. Punch\'s view of these matters.

Considering how uncertain the departure of the steamers is from this place, this is very unjust—the post-office ought to afford the greatest facilities possible. And yet, not only is this notice given by Mr. Forsythe, but it is also approved by Governor Glover, and that all these extra fees received are for the postmaster! Now this I may call a false pretence of receiving money in the name of the Government. Mr. Forsythe is a Timneh Creole, redeemed by the sheriff of Freetown when a boy, to whom he owes his education, and has got up to such favour that it is said, whatever he suggests to the Governor is sure to be done.\n\nThese extras are taken from Africans, who are not interested with Mr. Forsythe. I was in the post-office at the closing of the Antenian\'s mail. There were several persons whom I may call his favourites, who were late according to the specified time, but he did not take a pin as extras from them; others who saw this, of course, expected not to pay the extra tax; but he demanded the extras, and told them if it was not paid he would throw their letters to them, and they would then see whether they could post them or not.\n\nI shall be most happy to know from you, Mr. Editor, whether the habit of receiving extra postages is practised in England, and whether this mode is sanctioned by the General Postmaster of London to be adopted here. There are always too many letters now left behind, simply because the parties are late, and could not afford posting them according to Mr. Forsythe\'s new taxing regulation, which is a great hardship when the reply ought to have gone by the same steamer.\n\nIf you love poor Africans as your real friends, please try and help us in this thing.—I am, Sir, yours obediently,\n\nWILL O\' THE WISP.\n\n**NOTE BY THE EDITOR.**—An extra fee is paid in England on late letters, but it is affixed to the letter in stamps, and is not a perquisite of the postmaster, but goes to the Post-office revenue. We are sorry to hear of impediments in posting at African post-offices. As the postmasters have really so little to do, we think it is incumbent on them to keep the letter-bags open for every one until the last moment possible.

Last August the Royal Mail Steamship Company sent a ""time-bill"" to this river, stating that we were to have but one steamer a month, and that would be sent on the 5th, instead of on the 28th. We were willing to acquiesce, if the steamer was regular and gave us some few hours to read and answer our letters. But mark the way we are being served by this Company, which, if I mistake not, is bound by contract to send mails here once a month. Quite unexpectedly, the regular mail steamer called here on the 24th of September, and from that time until the present date we have had no opportunity of forwarding our letters to England. Captain Mercer, with the McGregor Laird, came to the bar on the afternoon of the 8th October, and after leaving the mail bag on board the cutter boat, instead of sending it up the river, steamed away immediately, without waiting for the homeward letters. This has caused much delay and expense here, and great anxiety to our friends in England. One gentleman who has been dangerously ill has been taken to the bar twice in an open boat to meet the steamer, but has had to return disappointed. Another from a distance has been staying here about a week with his boat\'s crew; who will pay for his loss and expense?\n\nEarnestly desiring you very abundant success in your honoured work; I am, yours most sincerely,', 'last_edit_date': '1870-01-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MAILS TO THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '_The Standard_, of December 27, has the following:—\n\n_To the Editor of the Standard._\n\nSir,—As you are always so ready to advocate the cause of the aggrieved, can you or any of your correspondents inform me and my fellow-shippers how and when the mails for the West Coast of Africa go and come, the contract for carrying them by the African Steamship Company having, it appears, expired.

I have known of letters prepaid to Switzerland, and when they arrived there, the postage was demanded again. On complaint, the postmaster gave the reply, that the letters must have been sent on board directly, instead of sending through the office (!!)

Consequently there is no monthly mail packet, and the steamers of the 24th of each month will no longer be under any obligation, as regards the Post-office, to leave on that day, or to call at the same ports as before. If they continue to do so, it will be because it suits the Company's arrangements, or its agreements with the British and African Steam Navigation Company, made during the existence of the contract with the Post-office. One or two deviations from the former practice have already been notified. The Gambia will be henceforth cut off from all direct steam communication with Great Britain; and it seems quite possible that the Cameroons will also be no longer visited. As there is, or is to be, an intercolonial steamer between Bathurst and Sierra Leone, the only practical difference will be, as regards letters, to and from Bathurst, that they will be some time longer _en route_. This, at least, is all the difference that the Post-office authorities will see, even if they care to look at all into a matter so very insignificant to them; while, as regards the people at the Gambia, we rather fancy, by what we have heard from time to time, that the leading mercantile houses there, all of whom have ships of their own, or charter ships out and home, will not weary the Government with prayers for restoration of direct communication. We shall soon hear how the change affects our Native African friends, and shall not fail to make known their views; although, since our successful labours in their behalf to prevent their being handed over, like so many sheep or oxen, to France, we have, with a few exceptions, received no payment from our nominal subscribers at the Gambia. It is not our intention at this moment to prejudge the working of the new system as regards the West Coast generally; but important interests have of late grown up there, to which something like certainty as to the time of arrival and departure of at least one of the monthly steamers, may be of importance. While writing this, on the eighteenth day of the month, the fact is before us that neither the steamer marked as due on the 8th inst., nor the one marked as due on the 14th inst., has yet arrived at Liverpool; contrasting unfavourably with the appointed monthly mail steamers which have rarely been more than a day or two overtime; and on those occasions the delay has been owing to unavoidable circumstances. Of course we must expect free steamers to look entirely after their own interests; and that cargo, rather than a strict adherence to any specified time, will be the object of importance with them. Here we shall let the matter rest for the present. We thought it necessary to give prominence to the fact of the change which has taken place, in this way, that every one on the West Coast may be made aware of it; and the subject will be noticed by us in future from time to time as circumstances may demand."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1872#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are sorry to learn that, although some of the post-office abuses were remedied, the old leaven still works.

1637,"The concentration of government appointments among a few unqualified individuals in colonial Africa led to inefficiencies, dissatisfaction, and corruption.","The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of how the concentration of government appointments among a few unqualified individuals in colonial Africa led to inefficiencies, dissatisfaction, and corruption. The General History of Africa highlights how colonial powers often appointed chiefs and leaders without traditional legitimacy, transforming them into administrative officers rather than genuine leaders. This manipulation eroded the prestige and respect for traditional rulers, sparking revolts and dissatisfaction among the populace. The reliance on intermediary structures, such as 'warrant chiefs,' further exacerbated discontent as these individuals were seen as instruments of control rather than partners. The systematic exclusion of educated Africans from positions of responsibility created an artificial scarcity of qualified administrative personnel, contributing to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction. However, the textbook does not explicitly link these issues to corruption. In contrast, The African Times articles explicitly address corruption, illustrating how multiple government positions were often concentrated in the hands of a single individual, such as Dr. Sherwood, who held numerous roles but was unable to perform all duties effectively, leading to inefficiencies and reliance on underpaid assistants. The exclusion of qualified natives from government positions in favor of a few favored individuals often resulted in corruption and mismanagement, as seen with officials like Admiral Patey, whose incompetence and dishonesty led to unchecked financial practices. The articles also discuss systemic issues, such as the lack of representation and accountability, which exacerbated inefficiencies and corruption. Together, these sources illustrate how the concentration of power among unqualified individuals contributed to widespread administrative failures and public discontent in colonial Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding the concentration of government appointments among a few unqualified individuals leading to inefficiencies, dissatisfaction, and corruption in colonial Africa.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'But not all those classified as belonging to the new elite in colonial Africa owed their membership of that class to education, nor did all those who owed it to education attain a uniform standard. As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""year in Cameroon. 68 The worst situation developed in Middle Africa, in the Congo Free State (later Belgian Congo and then Zaire), French Congo (later French Equatorial Africa) and German Cameroon, in almost exactly the area of the low fertility belt. From about 1890 concessionaires were given the whole produce of the land in vast areas of the Free State, while the system was supplemented by the creation of Leopold's Domaine PrivØ from 1892. Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed. Undoubtedly disease and famine followed the break-up of the village organization of labour and the flight of whole villages.$^{70}$ No one kept adequate population records See J.

Probably the evidence for such declines was based upon exaggerated estimates of pre-partition populations, and from the evidence of vanished populations along the tracks and river banks from which the people had fled. But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that population probably did decline in the region between 1890 and 1910 or even later (the theory that millions went to the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In parts of Africa, especially among such chiefless peoples as the Igbo, Ibibio, Ogoja, Tiv, Idoma, Birom, Angas and Gwari of Nigeria where it was difficult to identify the traditional rulers and associate them with the work of the colonial government, many members of the new elite came from among those who in pre-colonial times would have been classified as commoners. Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Moreover, nowhere and at no level did the facilities provided meet the demand nor were they evenly distributed.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town. In the Gold Coast for example about 80% of the secondary schools were found in Cape Coast. In Uganda, by 1920, there were 328 elementary schools in Buganda and only 34, 24 and practically none in the Western, Eastern and Northern provinces respectively.$^{37}$ Facilities for education were so inadequate and so unevenly distributed, because the colonial powers did not aim at pro› moting education for its own sake or for the sake of the Africans, but rather, to quote one African scholar, 'to produce Africans who would be more productive for the [colonial] system'. 38 Besides its grossly inadequate nature numerically and its uneven dis› tribution, the curricula provided by all these institutions were determined by the colonial rulers and were closely modelled on, if not carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan countries and therefore irrelevant to the needs of the continent. No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

I was lately at the Gambia: the people there are so cowed and so demoralised as not to have a spark of spirit left in them; the poor creatures want some one to fight their battles. At Sierra Leone, Rainy gives the Blackall spawn no rest or quarter, but the Colonial-office seems to uphold them as usual. I do not believe any other Government under the sun would tolerate and uphold its officials in such well-proved delinquencies as those which the British Government choose to overlook or ignore. I wish you and one or two other real friends of Africa would get into the House of Commons, and wage war against the continuance of the official abominations which prevail in these Crown colonies, where there are no representative institutions and no check upon the Executive.\n\nI got away from the Gambia as soon as possible, and am working my way quietly down the coast. The cholera, I regret to say, was at McCarthy's Island, carrying off eight or ten persons a-day; it is to be hoped that it will not get down to Bathurst. With something like a famine among the poor natives, this disease, if it crawls along the banks of the river, will produce frightful ravages. The poor creatures are now forced to eat leaves and roots to keep body and soul together.\n\nNothing will put things straight in these settlements except it be a more liberal system of government. The Augean stable here is too foul; it wants a thorough cleansing. How this is to be done I know not, and cannot see my way to it. As you want to make Africa what it ought to be, perhaps you may be able to solve the problem; I have not time for it.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An Englishman lately returned to England after some years\' residence on the Congo, said with regard to the above interview: While all the cases referred have not come under my personal observation, I regret I am unable to deny the general charges of inefficiency and brutality made against the State officials. The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

So strongly is this feeling expressed that the list of official appointments of Africans, which we insert on another page, is sent to us with the expression of doubt that we shall insert it. This is very unjust to us, and measuring us by a standard that ought not to be applied to us. So far from feeling any disinclination to do so, we are only too happy to insert anything that can place the many good official acts of the actual Administrator-in-Chief prominently beneath the eyes of all men, and we beg to thank our informant for putting us in possession of the means for showing all that has been done in the very important question of the filling the public offices in Africa with Africans.

Our own opinion is that continuous competitive examinations for those who are already in the public employ are unjust; that a man once admitted into an office is entitled to be moved up to the superior grades in the same office, subject to his being reduced again should he show a manifest incompetency. As we understand the letter and complaints we inserted, it was not that a European had been admitted to an office instead of an African, but that he had been admitted without a competitive examination being held for establishing that he was more worthy by his attainments than any of the possible African candidates.

Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The sanitary condition of the town of Cape Coast, and indeed of all the towns upon the seaboard, is deplorable.

As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.\nMore pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims. As a result, closely related and sometimes previously politically united peoples at times found themselves on opposite sides of the agreed boundary lines.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

The Prisoner pleaded ""Not guilty."" He was defended by Mr. James Brew. The substance of the case was simply this: The prisoner was the Chief Landing Waiter of Her Majesty\'s Customs here. On Sunday, the 27th of October, the prisoner sent for his assistant, named Hilton, by a little boy of his. The boy did not see Hilton, but saw the deceased, Jim, who was servant to Hilton, and he delivered his message to the Krooboy that his master, Hagan, wanted Hilton. The Krooboy told him that his master was asleep, and he would not wake him. An altercation took place, in which the deceased Krooboy pushed Hagan\'s boy, and he returned back to his master crying; whereupon the prisoner Hagan at once, in a violent rage, which he always exhibited to the helpless and the weak, sent a big slave servant of his, named Hebbit, to go at once to fetch both Hilton and this poor Krooboy to him immediately, which he did. As soon as they entered his house, Hagan at once commenced, with a good-sized horsewhip, to flog and beat this poor Krooboy on the top of the stairs, and followed up the beating down the stairs whilst the Krooboy was trying to run away from him. In running down the steps his foot slipped, and he fell downstairs, and Hagan still continued to beat him unmercifully, till the boy\'s back and sides were cut open and blood gushing out freely. This outrage was done in the presence of Hilton, the Krooboy\'s master, on that holy day. Hilton asked Hagan, ""What has my boy done to you that you should give him such a beating?"" He replied, ""He assaulted my boy when I sent him to call you."" The Krooboy ran away to his countrymen and friends, and told them what Hegan had done to him, and told them that in falling downstairs he had hurt his ribs. Then he returned to his master\'s house, and told the same tale to Hilton\'s wife; and from that time the boy never ate anything, his appetite being gone. But Hilton was afraid that if he sent the Krooboy to the Colonial Hospital he should involve his superior officer. He therefore endeavoured to hide this matter from the authorities, and did his best to save Hagan, by sending him to fetch his meals to the beach the next morning and the following. On Wednesday he was worse; they tried to get him to eat, but he complained of pains in his side and chest, and yet no medical advice was given him. But on Wednesday evening, finding he was getting worse, Hilton\'s wife gave the boy some native medicine used for asthmatic complaints. About midnight of that day he called out to his master, and while his master held him he died. The next morning, Thursday, they found blood gushing out from his mouth and nose, and some other matter. Instead of Hilton reporting the matter to the District Commissioner, he went to Hagan, the prisoner, to tell him that the Krooboy was dead, meaning that his cruel act had taken effect, and asked what he should do. The result of that interview was, that this Krooboy was privately hurried to the grave; and this would have been the last of it. The true cause of his death would never have been known by any person in this world, had it not been that the other Krooboys, who were indignant and in a great rage, got some kind friends, natives of Sierra Leone, to write a letter for them, reporting the circumstances, to the District Commissioner, who at once caused an inquiry to be made, and ordered the Acting Colonial Surgeon to have the poor boy\'s body exhumed, on Friday, the 1st instant, before a coroner and a jury. On a *post-mortem* examination they found the body in a high state of decomposition, so that Dr. Elliott stated that it was impossible to hold an examination, but he stated on his oath before the Court, that he saw abrasions upon his body, and that the horsewhip produced in court, if severely used on the Krooboy, who was only eighteen years of age, was sufficient to cause the loss of appetite, and the symptoms on his body; and that death would be the result.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters.

The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Our Eleventh Year', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We confess to a feeling of deep sadness in commencing another year of this journal. There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress. Occasionally our path is cheered by some enthusiastic testimony to the good we are effecting; but for the most part we have to complain of a seeming apathetic indifference, which greatly dishonours those who evince it. We are entitled, after eleven years of unrequited labour, to say, that it is a flagrant disgrace to every African who can read and does not subscribe to this paper and pay for it. Men ought to feel ashamed to borrow it of their neighbours when they can themselves procure it by paying the modest sum of five shillings a-year for it. The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times. There are doubtless some of the most intelligent of the educated Africans in every settlement who fully comprehend all this—and to them we say, they do not perform their duty by merely subscribing to and reading our paper; they ought to form themselves everywhere into committees for furthering subscriptions to it.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working."" We are glad to learn that under the provisions of a new Order in Council the administration of justice in similar cases seems likely to be simplified.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ARREST OF AN AFRICAN CHIEF BY THE GERMANS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British & African Steam Navigation Company’s steamer Cameroon arrived in the Mersey on April 28, from the west and south-west coasts of Africa.

The impôt de cueillette, the tax by which wild rubber was harvested in the Congo Free State, was the most criticized of such taxes, but in duration the French prestation, a labour tax required of all males in French West and Equatorial Africa unless remitted by cash payment, was the longest; it was only abolished in 1944. Conversely, the Germans in the Cameroon allowed the capitation tax to be remitted by a labour 'payment'. And in parts of Uganda, the British continued the luwalo, a pre-colonial public-work tax of one month's labour, until 1938, when it was replaced by a money tax. Yet such taxes were the exception to forced labour devices employed by all of the colonial powers.\nConsistently concerned with shortages of manpower for new projects and new employments which colonial rule supported, European administrators imposed their domination before the end of the century by a system of virtual impressment, frequently satisfying private as well as public purposes. It is true that such direct forced labour declined in the early twentieth century, because of the decreasing need for portage as well as the increasing concern with international opinion. But the uses, however modified, remained an integral part of colonial domination until the Second World War. At least this was the case with the French colonial governments which, as in West Africa still employed large numbers of Africans through prestation particularly on railway building until after the Second World War. Moreover, French colonial officials frequently sanctioned labour recruitment for commercial purposes, as on rubber plantations of Equatorial Africa or in the forests of the Ivory Coast.$^{28}$ Abuses at this time were still sufficient in intensity to arouse expressions of public indignation, most well marked in the celebrated commentary of AndrØ Gide in his Voyage au Congo (1927)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal.

In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

However, they bore the cost of the armed interventions necessary for destroying African political independence and for laying the groundwork of the colonial economies. They were indeed unrestrained in their brutality, especially where labour recruitment was made more difficult by sparse population, as in French Congo (now Congo).

At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context.

The legal basis for forced labour which was to continue under varying guises until 1961, was delineated in Article 1: All native inhabitants of the Portuguese overseas are subject to the moral and legal obligations to seek to acquire through work, those things which they lack to subsist and to improve their own social conditions. They have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this obligation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities may force them to comply. 65 And force them they did. Local administrators had complete discretion to determine who was 'idle', and virtually all chefes des posto supplemented their modest salaries through gifts and favours from European planters, merchants, factory owners and farmers in return for African labour. As a result, the rural areas were transformed into large labour reserves. When workers were needed to work on settler estates, to build roads, expand the ports of Luanda, Lourenço Marques and Beira, lay railway lines, serve as domestic servants or for any other private or public tasks, local administrators did not hesitate to use their control and their power to satisfy labour demands.

The limit was reduced to 10% in the middle of the decade because of the drying-up of the labour pool; but in general the official quota was very considerably exceeded.$^{20}$ In the Portuguese colonies, a subtle distinction was established between 'penal labour' reserved for convicts, and the labour - 'a moral and social obligation' - of men between 14 and 60 years of age, for at least six months per year.$^{21}$ The state was 'to have no scruples about obliging and if necessary forcing the Negro savages of Africa to work, that is, to improve themselves through labour in order to improve their means of existence, to civilize themselves'. 22 The plague of recruiters was particularly prevalent in the Congo, where the state delegated its powers of recruiting to companies such as the Bourse du Travail du Katanga (BTK) a private agency recruiting for the mines in the rural zones.

Still others escaped shortly after their arrival at the mines. As early as 1914 desertion had become such a serious problem that the BTK introduced a pass system and a finger-printing bureau to trace 'fugitives'.$^{5}$ ' Despite such coercive tactics, desertion continued to be prevalent.

In 1921, a large number of miners at Luishi, for example, walked off the job and proceeded to Elizabeth ville to complain to government officials of ill-treatment and poor rations. Two years later a similar work stoppage occurred at the Kakontwe mines. 53 The Depression created new economic uncertainties. Jobs disappeared, wages dropped and working conditions deteriorated, as mining interests sought to minimize costs.

I made another trip in July, 1864, during a season which all ground-nut traders called good, as the rains were plentiful, and there was every prospect of a good crop. I was surprised to see large and well-regulated drains made or making in almost every part where I went, walled on either side with stone or bricks—running from one side of the town to the other, and emptying into the sea. A great many were in an imperfect state, some of which were interrupted by the approach of the rainy season.\n\nIt was pleasant to see fine squares in the middle of the town, all covered with the green Bahama grass, and some of the drains supplied with railings. It struck me at once that there was a wonderful change in the interior of Bathurst since I last had seen it. There were good bridges in the centres of the streets, where in 1855 I had to walk knee deep in water. There was no more an inundation from the muddy swamp at the back and left of the town, a proper sea embankment having been made by the present Governor, which led to the securing of a large tract of land from the water. This land has been a great source of revenue to the Colonial Government, as it was afterwards divided into lots, and sold at a very advantageous rate, bringing over 600l. to the colonial coffers. The road to the burial-ground, which was in a fearful state of swamp, and in many parts covered over with water, is now converted into a hard road, and forms a pleasurable walk.\n\nAt this visit I rode to the cape. It is a distance of about seven miles. The road from St. Mary's to the ferry was excellent and hard—a good carriage drive. The boat employed in the ferry is an antiquated piece of workmanship, perhaps about fifty or a hundred years old, of an American origin, equally broad in stern and bow, and worked by paddles manned by four men. Sometimes the boat is drifted about 300 yards beyond its landing-place. I have never seen such an ugly piece of mechanism, and it is tiresome to see the poor men labouring to make this huge log move; and although it is said that the colony is in a state of bankruptcy, I hope they will soon be able to replace it with something more modern and workable. The road from the ferry to the cape is partly good and partly bad, the latter portion being rapidly repairing by the civilian prisoners. The material used by the Governor is the shell of the common cockle, mixed with those of other gregarious mollusks.\n\nAll along the road are large Bombax, or monkey bread trees, and I noticed hollows scraped out of a great many of them; and on inquiry I was told that they were so ordered to be done by the Governor, to form rests for the women who carry loads on their heads.""}, {'id': 1738, 'article_title': 'AN AFRICAN, RE THE CHARGES AGAINST ADMIRAL PATEY.', 'full_section_title': 'AN AFRICAN, RE THE CHARGES AGAINST ADMIRAL PATEY.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1870#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_02_1870', 'content': '""The Ordinance alluded to in that letter was fully exposed and condemned by us at the time—we showed its bitter injustice, and the insincerity and deception of its preamble; and we were not sparing in our exposure and rebuke of those from whose devices (and for the furtherance of whose ends) it emanated.""

For the past few years a system has been introduced to this Settlement of utilizing convict labour in cases where the labour of mechanics and other artisans is absolutely required. The effect of such an anomalous procedure has been to discourage native industry, and to hamper all exertions tending to the development of their capacities.\n\n3. Your Excellency's memorialists would not be understood to question the right of the government to convict labour in so far as it is available without detriment to the prosperity of the community; they would, however, submit that the practice of apportioning public works amongst convicts and policemen to the utter exclusion of artisans of competent skill in the place is not only displeasing, but is calculated to produce bad work in the Settlement, although money is economically expended on their construction.\n**63**\n\n4. As one of the results of this niggardly policy may be instanced the condition of the streets in the rains, when it would be expected that active steps would be taken by the authorities to prevent their being overflowed with water. The drains, already overgrown with weeds, simply through neglect, conduce not a little to the impediments offered to peregrinators, by means of which they are obliged to wade knee-deep in the mud to get to their destinations. Convicts, like any one else without the necessary qualification to perform works of public importance, may be of use in patching up the streets with loose earth to be washed away in the rainy season; whereas if a few more pounds are granted to expend on really competent persons to have the drains properly kept, and the streets macadamized, not only the subsidiary, but the main object of Government would be attained.\n\n5. In former years an impetus was given to the natives, most of whom then fondly believed that encouragement would be continued to them in whatever branch of industry they embarked themselves.

The same practice is found to prevail in all of them, with some exception as regards Lagos, where works of public utility have been allowed a share. There is the same squandering of the public money upon official favourites everywhere, and everywhere an almost total neglect of those matters upon which the progress of towns, and districts, and countries depend. But for the present we will take Bathurst. Look at Bathurst. The imposts on trade and commerce have been, within the last three years, most prejudicially increased because of former lavish extravagance. The revenue must be above 20,000l. a-year. The colonial steamer for protecting and assisting trade up the Gambia, which formerly absorbed some 5,000l. a-year, has disappeared from the estimates and from river navigation, and what is being done with the money? In March last we were called upon to notice that, although the revenue has for many years past fluctuated between 15,000l. and 20,000l. a-year, not even a fire-engine has been provided for the town of Bathurst, so that when a fire breaks out in any of the native habitations, there are none of the means used in civilised countries for arresting its progress; there is a general danger, and much loss and privation is the result. In our June number an intelligent correspondent says that on all sides there is deterioration and no renewal—the sea-wall has been allowed to go out of repair, the roads are neglected and have become almost useless; while the writer of another letter in the same number inquires why such and such houses are hired by the local authorities unnecessarily at a great expense of public money, and only for the advantage and profit of some favoured individuals. It is from beginning to end a system of waste. There is so much a-year to be spent, and the question has been, not how much good may be effected for the Colony with it, but who is to have a share in it? Is it not shameful? Is it any wonder that the people complain? Little or nothing done for education; nothing for the assistance or protection of trade on the river; no bridge built over Oyster Creek, so that there may be always an open road into the healthy districts of British Combo;* not even a fire-engine to save the houses of the poor people from destruction; sea-wall out of repair, and roads neglected. We only give these as a sample of the really vital necessities that are not attended to, while what is amply sufficient for these purposes is uselessly squandered in other directions where it only benefits unjustly a few favoured individuals. Do not let us be misunderstood. We do not accuse the present chief local authority, the present Administrator, of squandering the revenue by any acts of favouritism. The worst we should say of him is that he allows the continuance of abuses scandalously perpetrated by others, such as the rental of the houses mentioned by ""Public Interest"" in our June number. Rather, the complaint made against Admiral Patey is, that having succeeded in getting a large sum into the colonial chest, he is not willing to expend any of it even on those most indispensable works—roads, bridges, and sea-wall.† For a moment there is a fit of official parsimony, and the misapplication consists in shutting that money up in the chest in useless inactivity, which ought to be made the instrument of present and future good to the colony. We venture to call the serious attention of the Administrator, Admiral Patey, to these things. Why should he not make his administration memorable on the Gambia by the correction of old abuses, and the application of some portion of the surplus funds he so happily possesses, on objects that will bring him thanks and blessings from a grateful people. Let him begin by importing that most necessary adjunct of civilisation, a fire-engine; and then form a volunteer fire brigade; teaching the natives how they may most usefully employ themselves in extinguishing a conflagration. We really long for the opportunity of praising Admiral Patey or some other of our West Coast administrators. We have volumes of laudation ready for them if they will only give us proper occasion for using it, for the fact is they have afforded us so little chance of applying any portion of it during the past eight years, that the accumulation on hand is quite embarrassing. We should like to see a healthy emulation among them as to who should establish a claim to the largest portion of it.

The rains have been so plentiful that the crops promise to be heavy and good, and famine is already disappearing. The season up to the present has been unusually healthy; part of this may be attributed to the improved state of the drains and streets, under supervision of the acting Colonial Engineer. N.B.—This is generally the case when the office is in the hands of an acting man. When the permanent man is here, economy, dirt, and disease go hand in hand.\n\nThieves have been as plentiful as the rains. Some time ago they broke open the Customs' stores and took three baskets of colar nuts out, had shipped two baskets in a canoe, and were in the act of shipping the third one when they heard the night patrol passing, got frightened, and fled with their canoe, leaving the third basket on the beach. Now, there was one constable as sentry at this store, and another at the Customs' gate across the street, yet neither of these men heard or saw the thieves. Query: Are they and the police in collusion? The fact is, the Government ought to bring in a sort of vagrant law to check the congregation of loafers and bad characters in Bathurst. Such people, having committed crimes in other parts of the river, flock in here, and any day you will see scores, aye, even hundreds, of native men lounging about under trees, sleeping or conversing. These men never work, have no known business; most of them are known to the inhabitants here as bad characters; they remain here for weeks or months until they can make a haul, when they disappear, and are absent as long as the plunder lasts.\n\nThe French in Senegal have a good way of dealing with these fellows.

Some time ago he requested an old man here to send up the river and get him a small girl as a slave, from Fody Cubbai, whose raids still continue in the Jolah country, promising to pay whatever price would be demanded. In due time the girl came down in charge of two men—the price asked, 40 dols. Our official takes the delivery of the chattel, and tells the men he will pay them in a few days. They waited, but did not get the money. They began to press him, and at last demanded the girl back.

It would be quite impossible for us, under any circumstances, to insert this lengthy petition in our columns, independently of its containing some very strong statements which we could not print without having producible evidence in our hands to justify us in so doing. We will, however, endeavour to state in brief the substance of the petition. The petitioners refer to military services in defence of the colony formerly rendered by them; state how much they were opposed to the sometime-since projected cession of the Gambia to France, which opposition, they affirm, brought on them the ire of Sir Arthur Kennedy; and declare their willingness to act as an armed police and take charge of the barracks (as they formerly did), provided they may have their own countrymen as sergeants and corporals, and not be placed under Sierra Leone men. They then call his Excellency’s attention to the filthy state of Bathurst, owing to the want of a proper town inspector, and an experienced local engineer.

They there allude bitterly to the fact of offices which they are competent to fill being now in the hands of Sierra Leone men, imported into the colony expressly, to be there advanced over their heads, and call for the dismissal of those persons, as well as of others who have served their full term of years, and the appointment of some of their own number to the offices then made vacant. This is followed by allegations of a very serious nature against Captain Cooper, the actual Acting Administrator, and Dr. Spilsbury (an African of Sierra Leone), the Colonial Surgeon.

This indifference and neglect, which we feel justified in designating criminal, not only interferes with the progress of civilization, but subjects the community, both European and native, to renewed outbreaks of those destroying pestilences which have from time to time decimated the town of Bathurst. Year after year the educated native inhabitants, as well as Europeans, have protested against the continued permission by the authorities to the natives from the river villages who flock to Bathurst for trade, to perambulate the town in a state of nudity, and perform all the operations of nature when and where they choose, without the slightest regard to decency, and in defiance of all sanitary regulations which ought to be enforced in any town under British rule and law. We are at a loss to understand why such things should be—why British officials should continue to tolerate them, as if a decree had gone forth that it was not desirable that the blessings of civilization should extend in Africa. Bathurst, and all other towns on the Coast under British government, ought to be brought fully under civilized regulations, and become spots from which civilization should radiate into the neighbouring territories. That they should not be this, is a gross neglect of duty on the part of the authorities, and reflects deep disgrace on Great Britain. It is absurd to suppose that there could be any real difficulty in insisting upon public decency within the town of Bathurst. While the unclothed natives from the river villages are allowed to come into the town in their unclothed condition, and treat the town in every way as if it were the bush or fields in which they reside, they will no doubt continue to do so, and look with ignorant and barbarous contempt upon the inhabitants who are not permitted, and would no longer permit themselves, the offensive freedom from all self-restraint which they, the ""untutored savages,"" enjoy. Is it too much to expect that British authority will now at last interfere on the side of decency and health? The ""untutored savage"" would not forego the substantial benefits he or she derives from his or her visits to Bathurst because compelled to wear a proper cloth and conform to certain sanitary regulations; and, accustomed to these self-restraints within the town of Bathurst, they will thus have entered, however superficially, into the arena of civilization, and become more accessible to the propaganda of civilization among themselves. Important, however, as this change for which we call would really prove to be, it is but secondary when viewed in connection with that continued neglect of the drains, and that continuous horrible condition of the place of sepulture, respecting which the Memorialists protest. Everyone who has watched and recorded the ravages of epidemics on the West Coast of Africa must remember but too well the awful visitations to which Bathurst has been subject. Only last year it was threatened with one of them, and not a few persons perished from its advancing breath, when, happily, a sudden meteorological change drove back the fearful enemy. In some of our letters we find fears expressed that the present season may be rather an unhealthy one on the West Coast, and the mere suspicion that it will be so ought to induce precaution on the part of individuals and authorities. The latter are to a certain extent answerable for the lives of the population over whom they rule; they are fully answerable to the extent of removable causes; and among removable causes, that of pestilential drains, of filthy thoroughfares, and of graveyards in which the decaying dead are exposed to public view, filling the atmosphere with poisonous gases, must certainly be included. By the time this number of our journal reaches Bathurst the fiend of pestilence may—though we fervently pray it will not—may, we say, be upon the town. Should such, unhappily, be the case—should there be a new holocaust of victims offered up on the shrine of official incompetency, indifference, or neglect,—we shall cry loudly for retribution on those who shall have thus trifled with the lives of a community, to protect and defend which is one of the most sacred of the duties with which they are charged.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1880#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'All labour is performed by the domestic slaves of the family, who, as a rule, are kindly treated, and are not often parted with, except under circumstances of necessity.\n\nThere is some reason to suppose that coloured traders and trading agents, when following their avocations at a distance from the settlements, occasionally engage in slave-dealing transactions with the natives; but these operations are conducted beyond British jurisdiction, and as yet it has been found impossible to bring any case home to an offender.\n\nIn point of unhealthiness the climate of the Gambia probably varies little from that of the other settlements. There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained. Unfortunately, the circumstances of the colony forbid the hope that it will for a considerable time to come be in a position to afford this outlay, even for a work of such paramount importance to its interests.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE TORTURE SYSTEM IN CAPE COAST PRISON.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have no doubt there have been and are some honourable men connected with the Cape Coast administration who have deplored what was going on, but who, not being legally responsible, overlooked their moral responsibility, because they could not admit it without interfering with heads of departments or denouncing those with whom they were compelled to live and associate.

A mock attempt to keep away the water by Mr. Bauer, the engineer, whose signal failure your Excellency's memorialists are willing to attribute to the parsimony of the government, which endeavoured to make use of mangrove and empty barrels to stop the sea encroachments, instead of erecting substantial dykes, or embankments for the purpose. The safety of the people could hardly have been in contemplation of the government, or steps in the right direction might have been taken to bring about this desirable end.\n\n7. Gutters are urgently needed at Half Die. The streets in that part of the town are literally overflowed with water, on the subsidence of which a very sickening smell is produced by the filth generated by fecal matters, whose decomposition is accelerated by stagnant waters. The construction of sewers would drain off those offensive matters, and render the atmosphere pure and wholesome.\n\n8. Dry earth closets are in great demand in this settlement. The expense of erecting these is trifling when compared with the beneficial results that would flow from them. Strangers visiting these shores very often find themselves obliged to attend to the calls of nature, in places where a sense of decency should deter them from using. The reason for this is to be found in the want of public closets. Regret is often expressed at the unhealthiness of Bathurst, which is to a great extent enhanced by the filthy habits of Mandingoes, and other aboriginal tribes who come to Bathurst for trading purposes. The erection of these closets, in various parts of the town, would lessen the unhealthiness produced by the stench emanating from the excrements and nuisances of the tribes alluded to. *Your Excellency's memorialists humbly solicit that an ordinance be passed declaring it unlawful for Jolahs, Sereres, and others to walk the streets stark naked.*\n\n9. In connection with the matter lastly herein above alluded to, may be mentioned the desirability of appointing a sanitary inspector or water police, whose duty should be to prevent the sick that are brought from the rivers, and foreign places, being thrown on the wharves to take care of themselves, or die.

A pestilential fever, against the threatened approaches of which no efforts at prevention were made by ignorant, incapable, and criminally erring officials, marched up from the foetid swamp, descended into the habitations of rich and poor, European and native; and death, terror, and dismay reigned supreme over all. The graphic letter on our 2nd page tells a little of the fatal tale. The Chief Magistrate, a young man in the full vigour and strength of life, four Europeans, and three natives, fell victims in one day. Well might the poor stricken people believe that this was only the vanguard of the Yellow Fever which had made its ravages at Senegal; and against the probable coming of which we had warned the besotted officials, who were too intent, each on his own little game, to heed our earnest entreaties to set their house in order. A heavy responsibility for the precious lives that have been taken away, should lie at the door of those whose duty it was to take adequate measures for the preservation of the public health. The large surplus which is the present boast of the Gambia Treasury—to create which the public service has in many ways been starved, and for creating which personal promotion is no doubt expected—is now made loathsome by the putrid corpses of victims whose lives have been sacrificed to it. Cynics and profound moralists equally affirm, that at the present time nothing is worshipped but money. The officials of Gambia and Sierra Leone may be adduced in support of the truth of this stigma. We earnestly hope the results will not be as fatal in the latter place as in the former. But when blundering, incapacity, and selfishness had done their worst, a kind Providence stepped in with its healthy Harmattan wind, and the pestilence gradually abated. We hope the influence of that health-giving wind will be felt at other parts of the Coast. Its absence last year was deeply deplored at Lagos, where small-pox and other fatal diseases then prevailed. But although the pestilence has been killed for a time at Bathurst by the Harmattan, we hope the present safety will not renew the guilty official apathy; and that the lives of the inhabitants will be deemed of more value than a few hundreds of pounds, more or less, in the Treasury. We say advisedly, guilty official apathy. Look at paragraphs in a letter from Bathurst in our last month\'s paper, page 2: ""The streets and drains are very dirty, the effluvia from the latter very bad; the native yards in a filthy state; and though we pay local rates of 400l. a year, and there is a surplus now in the Treasury of 6,000l., yet not a penny can or will be spared for sanitary measures, because Mr. Bauer"" (the Colonial Engineer) ""will not act;"" and yet we are face to face with a most sickly season; fever fast approaching to an epidemic in virulence; deaths are rapid and numerous, natives as well as Europeans. Still nothing is done!"" Our correspondent goes on to say that some months ago, ""We sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary, complaining of the inefficiency of the Engineer Department, asked for a Board of Inquiry, and engaged to substantiate all our charges. Dr. Gouldsbury"" (the Administrator, who is a most intimate friend of Mr. Bauer and his family) ""wrote to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, to the effect that our statements were false; our complaints personal feeling; that Mr. Bauer was a \'most zealous and efficient officer,\' &c. The Colonial Secretary wrote back to us to the effect that, in view of the Governor\'s report, he gave no credence to our statements, and would not grant any inquiry."" In other words, the memorialists of Bathurst had the lie given to them, in the same way that it was also given to those of Sierra Leone; in both cases upon the mere ipse dixit of the erring Governor. Alas! what a commentary on all this is the fearful mortality that has plunged Bathurst into wailing, lamentation, and woe; a mortality distinctly traceable to Engineering and Administrative favouritism and incapacity or heartless indifference.

Local taxes as such cannot bring a Revenue, and when the Administration under the pretext of protecting the large mercantile houses, which are well able to take care of themselves, from being defrauded by their traders, restricts liberty of commerce in the rivers and renders it possible for licenses to be arbitrarily refused to applicants for the same, it deals a fatal blow to the prosperity of the Colony whose resources, as it is well known, are very limited. Section 4 of the Ordinance reads as follows:—\n\n""That it shall be lawful for the Colonial Treasurer or any such Commissioner to refuse to issue a license to any applicant, unless such applicant shall first produce a certificate signed by a member of either the Executive or Legislative Council and by two Justices of the Peace that he is of good character and a fit and proper person to be entrusted with such license.""\n\nThe chief objection to this section is that it is unconstitutional, and interferes arbitrarily with the liberties of a British subject. It also opens a wide field for abuse, and practically places the liberties of the entire trading community in the hands of three unofficial members of the Executive or Legislative Council who are themselves merchants. All men are human, business men not excepted; and would it not be a source of temptation for men wielding such a power to place obstacles in the way of their fellow competitors, the other mercantile firms and small business houses? The section providing for the revocation of licenses is also impolitic.

Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions.

This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'As an eminent economist has pointed out, \'tribal differences might dis› appear easily in the modern world if all tribes were equal economically.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

In both cases there was only limited success, mainly due to the ignorance and presumptuous attitude of 'the experts'. 32 In Kenya and the Rhodesias the production of cash crops increasingly passed into settler hands as the twentieth century advanced. During the first decade of the century African peasant producers in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia competed with white settlers quite effectively in pro› ducing most of the grain which fed the growing numbers of wage earners. Indeed until 1914 African farmers in Kenya contributed more to the cash and export sector than the settlers. This was the period when the settlers were struggling without much success to establish themselves. At this time, too, the impact of the political economy of colonialism was relatively small. Soon the settlers and planters discovered that they could participate effectively in the production of cash crops only if they acted through the respective colonial administrations and systematically reduced the role of African producers to the minimum possible. But settler agriculture, in› efficient as it was, required an ample supply of cheap labour. As one Kenya administrator assessed the situation in 1905, 'native labour is as necessary in the development of the land as are rain and sunshine'. 33 Accordingly a number of steps - mostly imported from South Africa were taken to drive Africans to work for the white man.

The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

These did not exist in pre-colonial Africa where, as J. C. Caldwell has shown, until the colonial era, 'nearly all land transport was by human porterage' (Chapter 18). This basic infrastructure had been completed in Africa by the 1930s and not many new miles of, say, railways have been built since then.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools.

The Government placed the man since under medical supervision; but being reported as quite sane, the law had to take its course, as an example was necessary to check these murders among natives, which are far too frequent, and seldom come to the knowledge of the authorities, through want of native detectives in the police force.\n\nFrom Scarcies River we learn that the Sierra Leone Government having put duties on all goods imported into that river—though it is a native river, and one over which the Home Government disclaimed all control or possession some years ago—they stopped a steamer of C. A. Verninck, merchant, of Marseilles, and made her pay 150£ duty on her cargo; and all the French factories there will have to pay heavy duties. C. A. Verninck declares this illegal, and claims 50,000£ compensation. It is too bad the way Great Britain ignores jurisdiction and its sequence, when she has it by treaty, and at other times seeks to manufacture it brand new when it suits her officials.\n\nThe Colonial Engineer putting in practice his theory of water by deep-boring pumps versus shallow wells, though warned that experiments years ago proved that the deeper you go after ten feet or so, at Bathurst, the worse the water gets, has just put down a pump in the yard of the Court.

Well, here is a nice case: Last month the son of the King of Nyan came down with a few followers to Changally, a port in that country, and ordered the traders, all servants of merchants at Bathurst, to lay down while he rode his horse over them. They refused. He fined them $40 each. They refused to pay. He and his men attacked one of the traders with their cutlasses and nearly cut his arm off; the rest took their guns and prepared to fight. The Prince, a mere boy, then went off to another town to get more men. The traders sent off to Bassi—a port near by—to the representative of one of the merchants. He at once armed all the people there, and sent them overland to Changally, while he went by water. They arrived in time. When the Prince and his scamps returned they surrounded them, told them they were prisoners, that no harm would be done to them, but they would have to remain under guard until the King was communicated with. A messenger was sent by the agent to report to the King. The King sent down and asked forgiveness for his son, and sent men to bring him and his companions up in custody to the head town to punish them. The King was warned to keep...\n\nhis son quiet in future. Now, but for this prompt action, this young fool would have attacked these traders, beaten them, most likely killed some of them, and surely plundered them of all their goods.

The same practice is found to prevail in all of them, with some exception as regards Lagos, where works of public utility have been allowed a share. There is the same squandering of the public money upon official favourites everywhere, and everywhere an almost total neglect of those matters upon which the progress of towns, and districts, and countries depend. But for the present we will take Bathurst. Look at Bathurst. The imposts on trade and commerce have been, within the last three years, most prejudicially increased because of former lavish extravagance. The revenue must be above 20,000l. a-year. The colonial steamer for protecting and assisting trade up the Gambia, which formerly absorbed some 5,000l. a-year, has disappeared from the estimates and from river navigation, and what is being done with the money? In March last we were called upon to notice that, although the revenue has for many years past fluctuated between 15,000l. and 20,000l. a-year, not even a fire-engine has been provided for the town of Bathurst, so that when a fire breaks out in any of the native habitations, there are none of the means used in civilised countries for arresting its progress; there is a general danger, and much loss and privation is the result. In our June number an intelligent correspondent says that on all sides there is deterioration and no renewal—the sea-wall has been allowed to go out of repair, the roads are neglected and have become almost useless; while the writer of another letter in the same number inquires why such and such houses are hired by the local authorities unnecessarily at a great expense of public money, and only for the advantage and profit of some favoured individuals. It is from beginning to end a system of waste. There is so much a-year to be spent, and the question has been, not how much good may be effected for the Colony with it, but who is to have a share in it? Is it not shameful? Is it any wonder that the people complain? Little or nothing done for education; nothing for the assistance or protection of trade on the river; no bridge built over Oyster Creek, so that there may be always an open road into the healthy districts of British Combo;* not even a fire-engine to save the houses of the poor people from destruction; sea-wall out of repair, and roads neglected. We only give these as a sample of the really vital necessities that are not attended to, while what is amply sufficient for these purposes is uselessly squandered in other directions where it only benefits unjustly a few favoured individuals. Do not let us be misunderstood. We do not accuse the present chief local authority, the present Administrator, of squandering the revenue by any acts of favouritism. The worst we should say of him is that he allows the continuance of abuses scandalously perpetrated by others, such as the rental of the houses mentioned by ""Public Interest"" in our June number. Rather, the complaint made against Admiral Patey is, that having succeeded in getting a large sum into the colonial chest, he is not willing to expend any of it even on those most indispensable works—roads, bridges, and sea-wall.† For a moment there is a fit of official parsimony, and the misapplication consists in shutting that money up in the chest in useless inactivity, which ought to be made the instrument of present and future good to the colony. We venture to call the serious attention of the Administrator, Admiral Patey, to these things. Why should he not make his administration memorable on the Gambia by the correction of old abuses, and the application of some portion of the surplus funds he so happily possesses, on objects that will bring him thanks and blessings from a grateful people. Let him begin by importing that most necessary adjunct of civilisation, a fire-engine; and then form a volunteer fire brigade; teaching the natives how they may most usefully employ themselves in extinguishing a conflagration. We really long for the opportunity of praising Admiral Patey or some other of our West Coast administrators. We have volumes of laudation ready for them if they will only give us proper occasion for using it, for the fact is they have afforded us so little chance of applying any portion of it during the past eight years, that the accumulation on hand is quite embarrassing. We should like to see a healthy emulation among them as to who should establish a claim to the largest portion of it.

Men who are educated consider themselves too good for labour as agriculturists, and only a very few condescend to become carpenters or blacksmiths. To be a clerk or a trader is the one idea of the native who can read and write and has some knowledge of the first three rules of arithmetic. Those who remain Pagan, or rather who do not frequent the schools and chapels, and live according to old habits, have few wants, and those easily supplied. Six weeks' work in the year will supply corn ample for all their wants, whilst capaiva, bananas, and such like, once a plantation is established, continue to produce for years, and oil and peppers may be had for the trouble of collecting them. Tobacco grows in the country, but the people are usually too idle to cultivate it, and it constitutes the main portion of what they buy from the traders. The cloth to cover their nakedness, and beads, powder, guns, wire, &c., they can buy with a lucky find of gold, or by gathering the fruit of the oil palm to make oil, and bartering it. As a native can live luxuriously on 3d. a day, even if he has no plantation and no wife to cook for him, and for another 3d. he can get drink and tobacco, whilst his housing costs him nothing, and 1s. or 1s. 3d. a day is his usual wages, a man who works for a month or two months in the year can afford to be idle for the remainder. The Gold Coast could be one of the greatest of producing countries if only there were some people in its boundaries who would work. There is scarcely a yard of garden except what is called for by the actual necessities of the people, and plantations for the purpose of export do not exist. As one gets more among the natives who are free from the influences of the coast one looks for some improvement, but except that slavery still exists, and that therefore some people are forced to show a certain amount of industry, there is none to be found. To this lack of industry must be added another great blot on the condition of the country; that is the apathy of the Government with regard to public works, and specially with regard to the improvement of communications. The revenues are hoarded in the colonial chest, and necessary repairs to public buildings are begrudged, whilst any expenditure on improvements is unknown. The roads or tracks are under the supervision of the district commissioners, usually officers of the Houssa constabulary, and are made and cleared in a spasmodic manner by a species of forced labour, in which the greater portion of the work is done by those who receive least benefit. The improvement and construction of landing places, and the construction of a tramway for the transport of oil to a good place of shipment, have been spoken of for years, but the powers that be consider it is more advisable to have a good balance in the treasury than to spend a sixpence on the most needed improvements; and as for the Colonial Office, the general feeling there is that our African possessions are a nuisance, and that if we could get rid of them it would be a good job.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bishop of Sierra Leone on the Education of the West African', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In his book, ""Sierra Leone after a Hundred Years"" (Seeley & Co.), Bishop Ingham, in reviewing the work which has been accomplished in and around Sierra Leone, observes:—\n\n""It is impossible not to regret that the Church Missionary Society were unable to develop in the schools of the Colony some accurate knowledge of manual trades. The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa.

The system of building in large compounds is connected with the laws and superstitions of the country; a general change and improvement in house building will go hand in hand with changes in Government and religion.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Mission stations developed plantations in many parts of Africa and in addition to growing local foodstuffs and introducing new crops, they helped in the diffusion of commercial crops like cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and sugar cane.\nAbove all, Christianity infused many new ideas. The ideas were not entirely new, and there were points of convergence between what the missionaries preached and what the Africans believed, such as the belief in God and obedience to His will as the final Judge and Creator of men.\nThe missionaries, however, had a negative attitude towards African religion and culture and were determined right from the start to stamp them out. The missionaries preached that the only God was the one whose nature and character had been revealed in the Bible, and that all other gods were mere illusions; that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was the final revelation and the only Saviour of mankind, and that the Church was the sole dispenser of divine grace and that there was no salvation outside the Church.

This sense of insecurity and frus› tration, often heightened by the series of economic crises that occurred, especially in the 1920s and 1930s and after the war, led, especially in the towns, to a high incidence of crime, divorce, delinquency and violence.

The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

Sierra Leone, among other West Coast colonies and settlements, has been held up to public odium in England as being partly dependent on the Imperial Exchequer; and yet we send her out officers who seem to look upon her small revenues as a prey to be devoured, instead of a trust to be vigilantly guarded. No funds can be found for sanitary improvements, so much required; for education, so indispensable. Foul fever-breeding nuisances must remain; the burden of educating the people must be most unjustly thrown upon the Church and the Wesleyan Missionary Societies. And why? Because the revenues raised in the colony are insufficient? No; because they are wasted, misapplied, and plundered. Look, for example, at the post of Inspector-General of Police. In Governor Hill's time the police force of Sierra Leone was an efficient body. We complain of it as being even then too large, and eating up money that ought to have been spent in education and improvements. But things have been worse since. A new Governor seemed to think the police burden might be increased. What are colonists in such a place as West Africa made for, but to be officially devoured? The revenues were evidently increasing, and Governor Blackall had been blessed with a son. Major Robert Blackall accompanied his father to Sierra Leone as Private Secretary. This filial devotion gave him, no doubt, a claim on the colony. Something good must be done for him. The police had no grand titular head, and, presto, Major Robert Blackall became Inspector-General of Police, with a salary of 400l. a-year! Now, nepotism is bad enough in a rich old country like England, where there are fat pastures for the favoured bipeds to graze in, though even here it is so stigmatised, thanks to advanced public intelligence, the power of the press, and the sarcasm of popular authors, that few public men are found daring enough to create new unnecessary offices for family appropriation. But in such a place as Sierra Leone it is pre-eminently bad. That such a functionary was not wanted is, we think, sufficiently proved by what we believe to be the fact, that during the last three years the supposed duties of this fortunate Inspector-General of Police have, with the exception of a few alternate months, been performed by deputy, while the Inspector has forgotten in the pleasant lounges of London and Paris everything connected with his office, except the never-to-be-forgotten quarter-day.""}, {'id': 1589, 'article_title': 'The Native Pastorate at Sierra Leone', 'full_section_title': 'The Native Pastorate at Sierra Leone', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1869#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_06_1869', 'content': 'Episcopal Church alone, we should have thought it to be the duty and privilege of the colony to endow and establish it, thus identifying the future State with the propagation of the Gospel of Christ Jesus our Lord.

They are both Protestant Churches; both hold and teach the essential truths of the Gospel, and love to see the Bible in the hands of every member of their communion, and, indeed, of every human being, as containing all that is necessary to human salvation without dependence on priesthood or human inventions. The work of evangelisation has been carried on by both of them in the colony with equal zeal and success, and both ought to receive aid from the revenues of the colony, if that aid can be given in a form which does not create dependence.

The education given to the rising generation must be combined with religious teaching; and we cannot conceive any way in which the sum of, say, one or two thousand pounds a year could be applied with so great present and future advantage, as in distributing it, whether in the form of capitation grant or in some other equal and impartial way, among the Church and Wesleyan schools. The time has come when the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies ought to be relieved from some part of the burden they have hitherto cheerfully borne in the hope of raising up a people in Sierra Leone to love and serve God. The time has come when the State, the local Executive, ought to take upon itself boldly the chief part, if not the whole, of the expense hitherto borne by those societies in educating the children of the colony; and we hope to see it perform this duty, which we are certain that it would do if the Legislative Council were such a representation of the people as it ought to be. This providing for the religious education of the children is a great and most important question; and we hope it will be solved in a way that will do honour to and promote the permanent welfare of the colony.'}, {'id': 3150, 'article_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'full_section_title': 'THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COLONY OF SIERRA LEONE.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1876#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_07_1876', 'content': 'It is quite impossible for us to dismiss the very important subject of a deficiency of public revenue at Sierra Leone with the brief notice taken of it in our last. The interesting communications that we have lately inserted, made by persons but too deeply concerned in the Educational department of the colony, on which, with that of religious teaching—the Native Pastorate—the earliest discomforts of the position seem to have fallen, in strict accordance with the old official principles of government in the colony, appeal too strongly to our well-known sympathies and convictions to allow of our doing so. We have received so many letters during the last few months, in which the writers give most saddening pictures of the moral state and condition of the colony, which our personal experience of a too prevalent dishonesty only too fully confirms, that we look upon the curtailment of education and of public religious teaching with the most serious alarm for the future of the colony and for the reputation of Sierra Leoneans everywhere down the Coast. We are quite aware that the old enemies of the African people will point to those conditions of individual mind and practice which our correspondents stigmatize, and of which we complain, and say, ""Education and religious teaching, forsooth! behold the fruits of them; we have had too much of them already. Some of the greatest cheats are men who have more than any other a redundancy of Scripture phrases at the tip of their tongue."" But they are grossly mistaken. Bad as such men are, they would without doubt have been much worse under the semi-civilizing rule introduced by the British Government, had not the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies laboured assiduously to counteract by education and religious teaching the demoralizing effects of example, which has had in time past all the weight of authority and of European intelligence to commend it to African imitation. It is not difficult to account for the prevalent dishonesty without making education and familiarity with Scripture texts responsible for its origin. Not to allude further to example, as already mentioned, the presence of Europeans and the influence of European government have created a wide array of new wants, without providing any other means for obtaining the money necessary to their gratification than Government employment and the pursuits of trade. Handicraftsmen and mechanics there are. The necessities of an advancing civilization have induced these. But where is the organized or individual agricultural enterprise, which would confer wealth on the colony, and give wide-spread, ennobling, and remunerative employment? The production of staples for commerce is still, as in the olden time, a pursuit followed only by the uneducated aborigines in the interior. The result has been the creation of a trading class altogether out of proportion with the demand for European products in the interior, and the quantity of produce offering there for sale, and on which the entire commercial movement of the colony necessarily depends. We have long hoped to see some remedy found for this state of things, without which the healthful moral development, as well as the industrial development, of the colony is impossible. These hopes have been disappointed; and this is perhaps not a time to enter fully into a consideration of the causes that have led to that disappointment. We may say this, however, that sooner or later agricultural and other industrial pursuits connected with the soil must be made honourable in the eyes of the community, and the prevailing stigma of degradation (a curse originating in slave employment in the West India Islands, the United States, the Brazils, Cuba, and other countries into which the victims of an atrocious slave-trade were imported) be removed from it. Already we see the dawn of this happy day in Liberia, which has to depend entirely on its own resources; and we sincerely hope that Sierra Leone will follow suit. With this view we earnestly and emphatically deprecate all money grants by Great Britain to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone must be made to depend entirely on its own revenues. If those revenues be insufficient for the public service of the colony as at present organized, the work of retrenchment must be at once commenced. A revenue of 80,000l. to 90,000l. a-year, or even a much smaller revenue, ought to suffice for all the legitimate wants of a settlement the population of which is about 40,000, as well as for those of the Sherbro\'. There cannot be any valid reason for patching up a rotten state of things by grants from the Imperial Treasury. As old and tried friends of West Africa and its people, we protest against any contributions from the Exchequer of Great Britain to bolster up abuses in Sierra Leone, and thus prolong the existence of a state of things which is working the moral and industrial ruin of the settlement and its people. But that retrenchment, on which we feel thus bound to insist, ought never to have touched the School Department or the Native Pastorate. This is indeed beginning at the wrong end.

But if it be so, we can only say that the Governor and his patrons have set up as imitators and followers of the worst of all examples. To tempt first, and afterwards to punish, is said to be the practice of the Arch-enemy of mankind. And here we have first, a demoralising and debasing system pursued year after year by the Sierra Leone Executive, under approval, of course; and then in due time comes forth the edict declaring the citizens to be incapable of discharging properly the duties of jurors. We utterly deny that they are so. To state it thus is to add insult to injury. But if it were so, who is to blame but the Executive, which mentally starves a whole people? We know of no greater cruelty or injustice than thus to impeach men with moral defects and delinquencies which could clearly be traced, if they did really exist, to the evil direction of the accuser. Surely if the object of all criminal law, and the machinery which it employs, be not merely to punish but to deter, Governor Blackall would find in the powerful instrumentality of education a more efficacious and Christian mode of attaining this desired end than that of the costly and immoral action of an exaggerated police force. The prophetic power of Pitt, the philanthropy of Wilberforce, the untiring energy and exertions of a Buxton and a Brougham, have expended themselves upon the social and moral advancement of Africa; and could some of them look from out their honoured graves, they would wonder that after eighty long years the lamp of knowledge should be so scantily supplied in their favoured regions, and brute force alone be in the ascendant. We grant that the latter, the rule of brute force, is the best a Government can adopt if it has determined that a people shall be kept in a low and debased state, or if, having once raised them to the dignity of citizens, it purposes to rob them by piecemeal of all that gives dignity to citizen life, and favours social advancement. Under the drowsy influence of universal ignorance, you may treat men as slaves, and in the fulness of time rob them of the sacred shield of the jury-box; but a wise and honest, above all a Christian Executive would shrink with horror from attempting to debase where it might elevate, or to take away where it is within its power justly to bestow. It is awful to think what must have been the state and condition at this time of Sierra Leone, if the noble Church and the Wesleyan Missionary Societies had not stepped in to the rescue of the people from ignorance and debasement. By and through their noble exertions there is an adequate number of citizens fit in every way for the duties and responsibilities of the jury-box, notwithstanding the disgraceful Government laches in the matter of education. But, as we have before urged, the time has come when this ought to cease. There are ample revenues now at Sierra Leone to enable the Executive to supply education to the people. Since the citizens have no power over the disposal of those revenues, they have but one course to pursue. Let them petition the Colonial-office, petition the British Parliament if necessary, either that some effective voice in the disposal of their money be given to them, or that the police should be reduced, education promoted, the jury-box preserved, the sanitary condition of the colony improved—in a word, that the proceeds of their duties and taxes should be spent for their social and commercial advancement as becomes a free people, and not in the exorbitant employment of brutalising influences, on worthless favourites, and unproductive follies.

The old leaven is evidently very strong in the lump of Sierra Leone officialism. It will be a difficult task to eradicate it; and it never will be eradicated in any other way than by a very clear and decided enunciation of a firm and enlightened policy of progress on the part of the superior authority in London. The general aspect of affairs in Sierra Leone is by no means satisfactory; and it most certainly will never be improved by measures such as we have above alluded to, which can scarcely fail to lead to an increase of moral darkness, where, alas! such darkness has but too much prevailed.

The Local Government believe more in police and gaols than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education. We say “religious education,” because all education for a long time to come must embrace the religious element, since all the teachers capable of imparting instruction have been educated by one or other of our great Missionary Societies. And well for Africa that it must do so; for education merely secular—education without any attempt to impart with it the restraining influences of Christianity—would curse at least as much as it would bless. Among older communities, the control of public opinion, the existence of a higher moral standard, the general outward profession of religion, may—we do not say they will, but they may—prevent mere secular instruction in schools, to the exclusion of the religious element, from producing those pernicious results which would otherwise most certainly accrue. But in West Africa, among people but lately redeemed from barbarism, and surrounded by a heathen population debased by the most loathsome superstitions and most revolting practices, the results of mere secular education could not be other than deplorable. The old leaven, we have said, still works strongly among the members of the Local Government. The account given on our second page affords sufficient evidence of this. We are glad to have been furnished by it with this opportunity of bringing so important a matter under the notice of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, whom we know to be especially desirous of extending the ameliorating influences of education among the people of West Africa. We must confess that the contents of the letter to which we have above alluded surprised as much as they have pained us. We had carefully watched the action of the Home Government in the mission of Mr. Laurie and his successor, whose loss seems to be so very justly deplored; and as another Inspector of Schools had been appointed, and there was an annual vote for his services and for the payment of grants-in-aid, it was not possible for us to suppose that a matter in which the Home Government had manifested so deep an interest could be so cruelly neglected. It was beyond our mental reach to imagine a regularly-salaried Inspector of Schools, and no inspection. That such an anomaly should have been permitted is disgraceful to the Local Government, and, we feel convinced, will bring down upon them that rebuke from the Earl of Carnarvon which their conduct deserves. The defrauded schoolmasters, for such indeed they are, have our warmest sympathy; and we thank them for having enabled us to bring the history of their wrongs, and the wrongs of their pupils (for these must necessarily suffer if the schoolmasters are not properly paid) under the notice of the authority which has power to redress their grievances.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1876#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Bishop of Sierra Leone on the Education of the West African', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In his book, ""Sierra Leone after a Hundred Years"" (Seeley & Co.), Bishop Ingham, in reviewing the work which has been accomplished in and around Sierra Leone, observes:—\n\n""It is impossible not to regret that the Church Missionary Society were unable to develop in the schools of the Colony some accurate knowledge of manual trades. The results in aptitude for interior missionary work, in energy, perseverance, and common sense, would have been enormous. ... The other plan (abstract teaching, divorced from material business) has been abundantly tried, and what is the result? Not only does the constant hammering at the brain, of which this raw (negro) youth must now become a victim, produce an unbalanced development, but the precocious memory that will characterise him is a deceptive gauge of progress made, and, like much precociousness elsewhere, the results are disappointing in after life. For this reason, a successfully-passed examination on paper is not the test in Africa that it is in England. ... Can we be surprised that the very last thing he (the negro young man) thinks of is the development of his country or making his father\'s village better than he found it—and thus his want of accuracy, want of perseverance and skill, and all that goes to make a man master of any situation, remain uncorrected, and put him altogether out of the running. We are convinced that there is a more excellent way, and we regret it has not more generally approved itself to those who have done such good work in other respects in this part of Africa. Other bodies, and notably the Roman Catholics, seem to be far ahead of us in this respect. How far they fail in developing the minds and consciences of the Africans we will not here discuss; but their systems of technical training are thoroughly worthy of imitation.""\n\nThe Bishop goes on to explain that the work that has been accomplished is by no means to be deprecated—indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to imagine how low Sierra Leone must have fallen, mentally and morally, were it not for the mission work carried on in face of such grave difficulties, and upon a soil necessarily so unpromising, since the first occupation of the Colony 107 years ago.

Now, what do the people of Sierra Leone mean by self-government? I believe I express the mind of my countrymen when I say that by self-government we simply desire some of those invaluable rights enjoyed by almost every community of British subjects—that is to say, to have the honour of saying nay or yes to those laws or rules of action by which our whole conduct as a people is guided, and most especially to have the privilege of managing, to some extent at least, our pecuniary affairs. In fact, Sir, the power of self-government for which we crave is but a shade better than what is termed in this country ""local,"" or ""parochial."" It is very far from our minds to diminish the power of the Council. Let them exercise their present authority to the fullest extent, and check any incursion we may dare to make into the laws through having power put into our hands. Nevertheless, Sir, we would pray and supplicate that Her Majesty\'s Government be pleased to grant and confer upon us an almost uncontrolled management of our ""local"" affairs. Without questioning for one moment the kind feelings of the honourable gentlemen of the Council of Sierra Leone, I contend that, from the very nature of their appointments, being liable to be removed from one place to another, it is impossible for them to take the same interest in the colony as the native inhabitants. It naturally becomes a matter of very little importance to them whether any material improvement takes place in the colony or not; having to leave it in a comparatively short time. The painful consequence of this is, that we see many important schemes which might be for the well-being of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are left undone. Mr. Editor, need I remind you of the intelligence which is brought to us by almost every mail, of the havoc the various kinds of fever are making amongst the different classes of the inhabitants of the colony? Is it, Sir, I ask, that these gentlemen are not aware of the principal cause of all this mischief? Do they not know that all this evil arises from the total absence of drainage and general sanitary improvements in the colony? It is not possible to conceive this. In fact, I should consider it an insult to every individual concerned to charge them with ignorance with respect to this matter. And yet, Sir, we see these most material improvements untouched. And why so? The answer is what I have intimated: It is not natural to man to labour for the sole benefit and enjoyment of others. And who will deny that if some of the native gentlemen, who know that the probable lengthening or shortening of their days hangs upon the existence or non-existence of these improvements, had the power of carrying them out, they would use their utmost efforts to do so? I am sure, Sir, your readers will not understand me to be overlooking the overruling power of God. These remarks hold good for many other drawbacks in the colony.

But what has been the result of the scheme towards which the Legislative Council has made an annual vote of 900l.? The Government, following the Revised Code, which establishes the principle of paying for results, makes an allowance of 6d. each—writing, reading, and arithmetic; whereby the schools became entitled, as the results of two examinations held by Mr. Popplestone the first year, to a sum a little above 400l. And here it may be observed, _en passant_, that in that gentleman the settlement has lost one in every way qualified for his work, and whose memory will long be cherished by all who have had anything to do with him. He regarded his charge as one of great responsibility, and was not ashamed to avow that ""the fear of God and belief in a risen Saviour must form the basis of instruction; that knowledge is only good in so far as people are by it made more useful to their fellow-creatures and holier and better before the Almighty."" The colony has been most unfortunate in the loss of Europeans who have really had the interest of Africa at heart. On his almost sudden and untimely death, there being no Inspector of Schools, it became with some persons problematical whether the grant that had become due would be given or not; and an application was made to the then Administrator-in-Chief, a gentleman of great legal acumen, who decided that, inasmuch as the fault did not rest with the managers, ""the grant"" could not in justice be withheld, and it was accordingly given. The wisdom and justice of such a decision appears from the facts (a) that the amount had been voted; (b) that an Inspector, not in love with his work, might find a thousand excuses for not going round to examine the schools; the Government, feeling itself bound to pay by an ordinance of its own framing, would be compelled, _however unwilling_ to do so, to put a pressure on an Inspector, who perhaps, whilst disposed to enjoy the emoluments of his office, might shrink from the onus of a tour round the settlement, though entitled to a travelling expense of something between 30l. and 50l. for a trip.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1876#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Immorality in Sierra Leone', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—Allow me only a small space in your valuable columns on the subject of the immorality in Sierra Leone.

The letters appeared at a time, Sir, when a misunderstanding existed between the European missionaries and the native pastors, and it would convey an erroneous impression in the minds of people far and near that the native clergy wish to get rid of the European missionaries.

Such men will, we are sure, secure the confidence and respect of the native clergy. The native Church and the colony are not so far advanced in education and intelligence as to be independent of foreign aid.

With regard to the misunderstanding to which ""Sierra Leonist"" alludes, I am happy to say that the Bishop has written, and there has been an amicable adjustment.—Yours truly,', 'last_edit_date': '1868-08-13', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have received a copy of the report on the census of Sierra Leone and its dependencies. The duty of superintending the taking of the census in this Colony falls, it would appear, upon the Colonial Secretary, who seems to have done the work with much care and thoroughness. The total population is put down at 60,546, and of these only 134 are classed as ""Whites."" With the one exception of Belgium, every European nation, not to speak of the United States and the West Indies, is represented, the English, however, being in a large majority. The African nationalities which go to make up the native population are equally varied. Notwithstanding the fact that there are 140 ministers of religion in the Colony, and double that number of lay preachers, close upon 25 per cent. of the inhabitants are classed as ""Pagans,"" and 5,000 of the balance as Mahomedans. Of the total population 23 per cent. are put down as traders and hawkers. Mr. Griffith asks, ""What good can come of a country where one-fourth of the people are dependent for their livelihood upon what they sell to the remaining three quarters?"" and he urges that ""some measures should be adopted to force these people to discontinue an occupation so manifestly prejudicial to their own advancement as well as to the country.""\n\ngenerally, and oblige them to engage in labours of production."" Whatever may be thought of this somewhat startling suggestion, it is evident from the return before us that Sierra Leone is dependent for whatever prosperity it may enjoy to the transient traders and strangers who bring in the articles which the surrounding country furnishes—gold, rubber, beeswax, gum, copal, &c. The native inhabitants are too indolent to labour continuously, and Sierra Leone has little to offer the European but fever.—*Echo.*', 'last_edit_date': '1881-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1881#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sierra Leone and Its People', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""I had looked forward to my trip to Sierra Leone with much interest, because I was anxious to see this interesting colony, and judge for myself the character of negro civilization. I was not disappointed in my anticipation of an entertaining and instructive visit; but I must confess that I was surprised to find that Sierra Leone possesses the claim it does to natural beauty. I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone. The colony is garrisoned by half a West India Regiment, and a considerable naval force is maintained on the coast to protect British interests."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1888#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True
