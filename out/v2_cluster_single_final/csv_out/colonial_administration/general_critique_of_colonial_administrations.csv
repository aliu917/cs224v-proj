40,"European colonial influence in Africa was marked by the recognition and manipulation of local political structures, cultural imposition through ceremonial acts, and the involvement of European royalty and officials to legitimize and reinforce colonial rule.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of European colonial influence in Africa, marked by the recognition and manipulation of local political structures, cultural imposition, and the involvement of European royalty and officials. The General History of Africa highlights the use of indirect rule by colonial powers, such as the British and French, who integrated indigenous institutions into their administrations by relying on local chiefs and traditional authorities. This manipulation of local political structures is a key aspect of colonial governance. The textbook also discusses cultural imposition through the spread of Christianity and Western education, often involving ceremonial acts and new cultural practices. However, it does not explicitly mention the ceremonial involvement of European royalty and officials, focusing instead on administrative and cultural impacts. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the ceremonial aspects, noting events like the Industrial Exhibition attended by European officials and the presence of European royalty at significant gatherings, which served to legitimize colonial rule. The articles also highlight the manipulation of local customs, such as the annual Fetish ""Custom"" in Elmina, where colonial officials engaged with local traditions to maintain control. Additionally, the articles provide a critical perspective on the negative impacts of European influence, such as the demoralizing effects of the drink trade and inadequate education, adding complexity to the narrative. Together, these sources support the claim by illustrating both the ceremonial and political dimensions of colonial influence, while also acknowledging the criticisms and complexities involved.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim regarding European colonial influence in Africa. It highlights the recognition and manipulation of local political structures through the use of indirect rule, where colonial powers relied on local chiefs and traditional authorities to administer their territories. This approach is evident in the British and French colonial strategies, which involved integrating indigenous institutions into the colonial administration. The textbook also discusses the cultural imposition by European powers, particularly through the spread of Christianity and Western education, which often involved ceremonial acts and the introduction of new cultural practices. However, the text does not explicitly mention the involvement of European royalty and officials in ceremonial acts to legitimize colonial rule, which is a notable difference from the claim. Instead, it focuses more on the administrative and bureaucratic aspects of colonial governance and the cultural impacts on African societies. Overall, while the textbook supports the claim regarding the manipulation of local political structures and cultural imposition, it lacks specific references to the ceremonial involvement of European royalty and officials.","The African Times news articles provide several details that align with the claim regarding European colonial influence in Africa. Firstly, the articles mention ceremonial acts and the involvement of European officials, such as the opening of the Industrial Exhibition with pomp and ceremony, attended by the Governor and other principal persons, which reflects cultural imposition and the use of ceremonies to reinforce colonial rule. Additionally, the presence of European royalty and officials is noted in events like the farewell dinner for Lieut.-Governor Griffith and the arrival of His Honour Mr. Justice Stubbins, which underscores the role of European figures in legitimizing colonial authority. Furthermore, the articles highlight the manipulation of local political structures, as seen in the annual Fetish ""Custom"" in Elmina, where the Acting-Governor's involvement is criticized for supporting local superstitions, indicating an awareness and engagement with local customs to maintain control. However, the articles also reveal a critical perspective on the negative impacts of European influence, such as the demoralizing effects of the drink trade and the failure to provide adequate education, which contrasts with the claim's focus on ceremonial and political manipulation.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.723, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place. However, policy ran a long gamut, from reluctant acceptance and forced adaptation of such structures as in Portuguese Angola and German East Africa, to considered efforts at institutional preservation as in British Northern Nigeria or French Morocco. Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways.

They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history.

Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""On the other hand, in the cultural and social field, the impact of colonial› ism was relatively neither profound nor permanent. Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

At first one feels bewildered amid the display of spears and daggers, axes, bows and arrows, shields, implements and utensils of brass and iron, fetishes, drums, tom-toms, stringed and other musical instruments, ornaments of gold, copper, brass, and others too numerous to mention; but he must be sure to study the historical series of maps which shows the progress of our knowledge of Africa, from the earliest period down to the present day.\n\nTwo of the maps are of special interest at the present time. One is a Portuguese map of the seventeenth century, in which the ""Empire of Monomotapa"" is represented as extending across the continent. The fact is the Portuguese of that period only knew the Lower Zambesi, and this they stretched out westwards to near the west coast, and the supposed empire was stretched out with it.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Old Calabar', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—It may be questioned whether we, in this remote part of Africa, are not excluded altogether from enjoying any European influence calculated to better our condition. To distant people, we form one of the most intelligent and civilized portions of Africa, who, although not under a European Government, are enjoying as much of their influence as if we were born civilized. But to have a proper knowledge of the cotton tree, it is necessary to approach it more closely, when it will be discovered that it is full of thorns. This is the only way I can contrast what our country is with what it is considered to be. Our country is, undoubtedly, a great port for the palm-oil trade; and it appears to me that the only influence existing is that of raking and draining it of every speck of oil that could be got—and nothing more. Sordid avarice and insatiable gain is their only and chief aim. We own that we are poor, ignorant, heathen people, and, perhaps, vile savages too, as we are often styled; but we cannot feel more happy than when we have Europeans among us, whose goodness we feel proud to copy and imitate. I do not think that the days of contraband, when man formed the chief article of trade among us, were worse than ours—the period when lawful commerce takes the lead, and the Christian religion regulates its progress. Trade, from the way it is carried on, has a rather debasing effect on us; religion, from the stingy manner it is introduced and its principles engrafted, tends to steep us in a twofold ignorance, almost as dark as that in which it found us; so that the only improvement resulting from the advantage both of commerce and religion among us, at present, is a low cunning and a doggish reverence. People whose ears are accustomed to hear the fair carol of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in our country through European influence and missionary efforts, might be constrained to denounce my observations as a slander: but if they know the truly meaning of multum in parvo, and how it is unscrupulously practised by their agents abroad, I need not labour to convince them. I do not ignore the fact that faithful workers have from time to time been sent to our country, and that, through them, we should have been better; but the thing is this, those already in the field informed them, ""When you go to Rome, do what Rome does."" The merchant, whose only ambition is to hoard up all he could rake from the negro\'s hide, grins with pleasure and satisfaction at his wretchedness, contrives new methods of aggravating humanity, and uses all his subtle skill in advocating, if possible, the total extinction of the vague, glimmering twilight that shines around us; and the missionary, as a rule, teaches the black man hardly anything beyond the Bible, transcribed in his own tongue. In one of their conferences, held at Gaboon, the missionaries have decided not to give us and our children any intellectual training. We keenly feel the result of such selfishness, not only for ourselves, but for our children and children\'s children. How painful it is to think that there is not a single youth in our country who is capable of being more than a menial servant in any of the European establishments here! Why is it so different at Bonny, at New Calabar, at Brass, and throughout the Niger territory? It is thirty-six years ago now since a mission was planted in our midst; yet we do not present a brighter aspect than that of a dilapidated and neglected plantation. There is nothing of civilizing industry introduced into the country whereby to profit our youths; whereas in the Niger Mission—which is working exclusively by native agency, headed by its Bishop, and a grand train of clerical and lay assistants—industrial training is incorporated with the work. To every mission-station in the Niger is appended a first-class boarding-school, the pupils of which are fit to teach the teachers whom the Mission here laboured so arduously to produce. The Niger is able to furnish herself with a good staff of able and competent artisans, interpreters, clerks, and teachers; and is getting up a theological institution to train their own men.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

There are thousands of native Africans who are in all respects the equals of the most cultured Europeans; and the average West African is not deficient in those qualities the need of which would prevent his governing himself; but subject to the shocking influences which are all around, is it to be wondered at that he sinks to a lower level than his entirely uncivilised neighbour in the far interior?', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country. All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home. With every trading colony of any size—that is to say, where there are more than three or four trading houses—there is a medical officer, jointly paid by the various firms.\n\nPerhaps in no body of Englishmen abroad has such an improvement taken place as in the class of men who now conduct the trade with the natives in West Africa. In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

There are two most effectual bars to such an event—our climate, and the present elevated tone of society, which would at once raise up an outcry against tyranny and oppression.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

They are eminently practical men. The English have founded another station in the Ukereone, a third in the Uganda, and a fourth at Ujiji. The power of the Arabs in these parts is decreasing daily.

The tribe in becoming Mohammedan is bound to keep its villages in a healthy condition, bound to accept a sanitary code, including abstention from strong drink; officials are appointed, trades are formed, every man must work, so that the most useful industries and delightful arts spring up.

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""This broad sketch of indirect rule in Northern Nigeria can be aligned with another which, like Lugard's, met most success in regions overlaid with Muslim political institutions. Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'.

Only in Morocco did the French seriously consider it, and there primarily because of the attention given to indigenous affairs by the ResidentGeneral, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who, in the initial years of the protec› torate, ruled with few restrictions from the metropolitan government. Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard. The French contrôleur civil was to perform in an advisory not a supervisory capacity with respect to the cadi, a Muslim official fulfilling magisterial functions in accordance with the shari'a. A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority. While the administrators in Italian Somaliland came closest to the British in their relationship to the local chiefs, even among these two groups Lugard's dicta were necessarily modified by the exigencies of colonial rule and the personalities of the"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North Africa and the Sahara', 'section_title': 'Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance', 'content': ""Within the framework of a society which had become de facto leaderless, the colonial army could easily take advantage of a divided opposition. Fully to appreciate how this worked, we must remember that the sultan's administration was often indirect, being delegated to local chiefs, Islamic clerics or shaykhs. When the sultan was unable to lead the resistance himself, every individual thought of safeguarding his own privileges, or 'climbing on the bandwagon' as one specialist in native affairs put it. 42 France had no difficulty in obtaining help to conquer Tuât from the Sherif of Wazzän (who could take up ziyâra (collections) among his followers in Algeria only with the permission of the French governor), at Shinkït from Shaykhs Sïdiya and Sa'd Büh, in the Tafilälet from the leader of the NÆsiriyya zäwiya, and lastly in the Rïf from the chief of the Darkäwa. In Tripolitania, the Italians won over to their side the Ibädites of the Djabal Nafusa, who were opposed to the Sunnï majority in the country. Where a great chief had built up a principality, the colonial authorities waited for a succession dispute to arise and then offered their support to each of the claimants in turn; this is what happened with the Trarza between 1901 and 1904 and among the Zayyän between 1917 and 1919. But the impact of this 'native policy' must not be exaggerated. Whenever a chief favoured the French, he immediately lost his prestige and was no longer of any use: so much so that in the end the authorities no longer sought public submissions.\nThe tendency of leaders of zarväyä and the great chiefs to compromise and play a double game thus resulted not so much from ethnic divisions and rivalries as from the disappearance of the supreme political power, whose successive defeats exposed its military weakness.\nHistory has handed down to us the names of some thirty chiefs who led the resistance against the French, Spaniards and Italians during the period 1900-35, not counting Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karïm and 'Abd al-Malik.$^{43}$ The others can be divided into two quite distinct groups regardless of their success or failure."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'A great majority of African rulers, then, did opt for the defence of their sovereignty and independence. It is in the strategies and the tactics that they adopted to achieve this universal objective that they differed. Most African rulers chose the strategy of confrontation, using either diplomatic or military weapons or both. As will be seen below, Samori Ture, and Kabarega of Bunyoro resorted to both weapons while Prempeh I and Mwanga of Buganda relied on diplomacy. Others such as Tofa of Porto Novo (in what is now Benin) chose the strategy of alliance or co-operation, not of collaboration.\nThis question of strategy should be highlighted here because it has been 12.

We are opposed to the use of this term collaboration not only because it is inaccurate but also because it is derogatory and Eurocentric. As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation. But as we have seen, the Africans were all faced with the question of surrendering, retaining or regaining their sovereignty. Those who threw in their lot with the Europeans therefore had their own objective, and it is therefore totally wrong to call them collaborators.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': ""Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894. When he ascended the throne in 1894, he seemed to be suspicious of Europeans, mostly missionaries at that time, so he sought to restrict his people's interactions with them. Those among the Baganda who had embraced the Christian faith and who would not obey his orders were put to death as traitors.$^{29}$ Today, Christians regard them as martyrs. Mwanga was, however, violently resisting attempts by British agents to take over his country even though disguised as mission› aries. But his diplomatic ability also became apparent in the way he handled various, often warring religious sects. At one time, he would play the two Christian sects, Catholics and Protestants, against Muslims when he thought the latter were becoming too powerful and therefore threatening his control of the country. At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler. Later, however, in 1889, Mwanga managed to regain his throne only to be exiled to Kisimayu, as already indicated, in 1899, where he died in 1903."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': ""Other African polities sought to overcome their limited military capacity by organizing broad-based multi-ethnic, anti-colonial alliances.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The great desideratum for him is power. Not arbitrary or despotic power, but that which must be consistent with sound judgment, justice, and wisdom, as well as conducive to the advancement of his country and people in Christianity and civilization.\n\nThe question, therefore, arises, How is he to be possessed of this power? Is it probable, is it reasonable to expect, that such stubborn, self-willed chiefs as those over whom he reigns would ever invest him, voluntarily, with it, or even permit him to assume it over them by dint of personal effort? I fear it is neither probable nor reasonable. It seems evident, therefore, that the king will have to fall back upon the British Government, which, in the days of Lord Brougham, most benevolently extended to his late father, King Dappa, when rebelliously deposed from his throne, its warm protection and support.\n\nSir, I am entirely at one with you on this subject. I think, with you, that the king should be given by the British Government, through Her Majesty\'s Consul for the Bights of Benin and Biafra, ""a steady and uniform support.""\n\nBut it must be through a friendly consul, who would be anxious to ""strengthen King George\'s hands so as to give him prestige and favour in the eyes of chiefs and people""—one whose energy and energetic service would be worthy of his position, and whose fairness and experience in native affairs would be unquestionable. A man like the late Vice-Consul—who in 1871 adjusted the complicated disputes among the different native tribes on the Oil Rivers with such diplomatic tact and firm equity, as have justly rendered him much respected and loved by both Europeans and natives—if appointed, would not fail to be received with universal satisfaction.\n\nThe king, should he be effectively backed by such a consul, would, it is to be hoped, bring about such organic reforms in his country as should give a coup de grâce to its degrading, superstitious, and barbarous customs, and as should preclude the possibility of the commission, with impunity, of all those fiendish deeds and revolting atrocities, the accounts of which are so frequently detailed in public journals.—Believe me, Sir, sincerely yours,', 'last_edit_date': '1873-06-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '* Possibly, although the writer of this letter did not know of it, Honduras has been also charged for Mr. Pine.

As must be well known to our readers, this colony was established about a hundred years ago, with the twofold purpose of providing a home, under British protection, for liberated slaves, and at the same time affording a starting-place from which the interior tribes might be reached, and gradually brought under the influence of civilization and Christianity. The improved condition of popular opinion upon the question of the Slave Trade has done away with the need contemplated in the first intention of its founders; but the second and more important part which was to be performed by the founding of this settlement, still remains, at least to a great extent, unfulfilled. In another column will be found some interesting particulars of the present depressed condition of Sierra Leone—a result brought about by the want of purpose manifested by those in charge—and showing the urgent need there is for opening up trade routes between the coast and the interior tribes, who, there is good reason to believe, will be only to ready to enter into commercial relations with the British and native traders on the coast. The Colonial Government—acting, there is reason to believe, on instructions received from the Home authorities—have not been so energetic in this direction as could be looked for, considering the importance of the interests committed to them. It is absolutely necessary for the future well-being and usefulness of the colony that means be taken by which the lawless and uncivilized tribes who surround the settlement should be brought to feel that their mutual jealousies and tribal disputes shall be no longer permitted, by blocking the trade routes through their regions, to interfere with the commerce that would otherwise be carried on between the settlement and the races beyond them. Sir Samuel Rowe's recent action seems to indicate that he is determined to break through precedent where necessary for the well-being of the people under his charge; and though it would appear that he has not met with all the success that was to be hoped for, at least he has shown these lawless tribes that we can and will interfere where necessary for the protection of our interests, and the benefit of the more civilized peoples further away. Some of these races, separated from our colony by this zone of lawlessness, have given evidence more than once of a desire for commerce with our people. Only a short time before the reappointment of Sir Samuel Rowe as Governor, messengers arrived at Freetown from the powerful Chief, named Shahmadoo, of Beri, a place 800 or 900 miles in the interior, beyond Footah. We hear that this Shahmadoo had a large army with him, and had already advanced some distance towards the coast, having expressed his determination, if necessary, to fight the whole way along, and, indeed, that he had already arrived to within a hundred miles of Freetown. He was very desirous that some European officer should be deputed by the authorities to accompany the messengers back with him. His request, however, was not complied with, which is to be regretted, as he professed that his only object was to open up communications between the settlement and his own people, who appear to be a tribe of the Western Soudan. Their country has not been visited by Europeans during the last thirty years, and we are told that they have large stores of gold, ivory, and other commodities, which might be exchanged with profit in Sierra Leone. Taking the account of these people for what it is worth, this, at least, seems to be clear, that there are in the interior races much more highly civilized than those nearer the coast, who will be quite ready directly the opportunity is given them of engaging in commerce with our West Coast settlements, and thus relieving them of the great depression under which they have lately been languishing."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIERRA LEONE; AND SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS FUTURE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'These are observations which have forced themselves upon me during many years residence in the colony; I should not regret to see them publicly known even at the risk of being contradicted, if I can only hope to have attracted the attention of the promoters of the very important matter of ""African civilisation.""—I remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully,\n\nT.

Fitzgerald, Esq.,  \nSecretary of the African-Aid Society, &c., &c.\n\n---\n\n**TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.**\n\nCape Coast, July 12, 1865.\n\nSir,—In your May number you have some very good remarks on the necessity of the British authorities out here checking the powers of the native chiefs. The truth is that so much confusion has been created here by the very unhappy administration of a governor who has lately been removed, and is now (happily for the country) in England, that it is difficult to understand the precise position these native chiefs occupy in our community, and what powers they may lawfully exercise. It is supposed that they are bound to render obedience to the Queen\'s officers, and not to oppress their subjects. But during Governor Pine\'s administration some of these chiefs did oppress their subjects, and very grievously too. One chief especially, named Quahmina Ahooma, of a place called Ajimacboo, plundered, seized, imprisoned, and oppressed any one he pleased, and all this with the knowledge, consent, and approval of his Excellency. This Ahooma is the chief who was permitted to put a man to death, without trial, in 1863, on the mere suspicion of having killed some one who had disappeared.\n\nThe present acting chief justice saw clearly the evil of encouraging these native chiefs in their oppressions, and on more than one occasion did good service to the country by administering severe checks to them; but Governor Pine always interposed on behalf of the chiefs, provided the latter had the sagacity to secure the goodwill of his Excellency\'s pirata interpreter. You may imagine that these native chiefs are extremely averse to the system of permitting any of their subjects to employ advocates to plead their cause.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-07-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Industrial Development and Civilisation of Western Africa—How to Effect it Rapidly', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present time is most auspicious for such a movement on the part of the real friends of Africa. America is at peace, England desires retrenchment and economy;—could they be combined in this enterprise, their friendly relations would be assured, and, by judicious action on the part of the commissioners, the commerce of Africa would be greatly enhanced—probably doubled—in two or three years. The large national vessels now on the Coast could be withdrawn—useless for all purposes of civilisation and commerce, they would give place to small ""blockade-runners,"" which, under the control of the commissioners, would be made to subserve the purposes of both. These, actively and usefully employed for the benefit of the negro and the requirements of Africa, would effectually inspire peace to her heterogeneous masses, and assure the negro that he was in the hands of his real friends. The commissioners should all be practical men—believers in the manhood of the negro, and in his capacity for unlimited improvement.\n**29**\n\nThe mere fact of the union of England and America in this great and beneficent work—of their having unitedly appointed commissioners to treat with all the tribes and nations of the continent—would of itself work a real and beneficial improvement upon the African mind, give efficiency and permanence to treaties, prevent wars among themselves, and secure respect and obedience to all just measures.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""This meeting views with satisfaction the attention paid by her Majesty\'s Government to British interests in Africa, and trusts that the results of their policy may be beneficial alike to the natives and to the legitimate enterprise of British subjects in that continent.""\n\nAfter an animated discussion, in which various gentlemen interested took part, the resolution was carried unanimously.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Occupation of Benin', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Cable advices were received at the beginning of the death of Lieut.

He had observed the manner in which the High Court had been conducted, and he had noticed that although there were differences of opinion they were all one. There had been unity, and notwithstanding the elaborate discussion, which was sometimes very warm, in the midst of councillors there was safety, and anyone could say ""Yea"" or ""Nay.""

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce. The British Congo Company (Limited), the prospectus of which our readers will find in another column, which may be aptly described as the practical outcome of the Conference's decision, is now announced, with a capital of £500,000, divided into shares of £5 each.

Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN INTERVIEW WITH MR.

The reliance on British officials like Rear-Admiral Charles G. E. Patey and Commander John Hawley Glover further indicates a preference for British personnel over local agency. Together, these sources suggest that while there were attempts to incorporate local structures, colonial governance often struggled with effectively integrating local agency and expertise, reflecting a complex and varied approach across different regions and colonial powers.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that colonial governance in Africa often relied on local agency and expertise.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.757, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The best resume of his policy is found in a set of instructions he issued to his officers in 1906, in which he argues for 'a single Government in which the Native Chiefs have well-defined duties and an acknowledged status equally with the British officials'.$^{10}$ The basis of what was to become the system of indirect rule was therefore one of co-operation, not sub› ordination, with the British Resident acting primarily in an advisory, not an executive capacity, and with the African 'chief - in this instance, the Fulani emir - continuing in a traditional role which was now carefully guided, not rigidly fixed by the imposed colonial administration. In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness. The colonial governments made varied use, as R. F. Betts has shown above (Chapter 13) of traditional institutions and leadership elites to facilitate their control of the subject peoples. Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

At the pinnacle of the administrative system stood the governor or residentgeneral who, while ultimately responsible to his national government, frequently enjoyed the powers of a sovereign.\nThe institutional framework within which he acted varied considerably in size and complexity, but he was usually assisted in the inter-war period by some form of consultative council or commercial interests. The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'.

A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure', 'content': ""In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government.

Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere. It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples. In the case of the Aro, it was the widespread influence of a set of oracles, managed through a network of Aro colonies and local 'secret societies', that provided a judicial and economic basis of integration over a wide section of Igboland.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 115, 'article_title': 'NATAL.', 'full_section_title': 'NATAL.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': 'A report was current in the colony that Sir Benjamin Pine, formerly Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, and now Governor of St. Kitts (West Indies), is likely to be appointed successor to Lieutenant-Governor Scott.

Having several outlying dependencies, and much internal water communication, she will also need the aid of a vessel of light draft of water, capable of running up the smaller creeks.\n\nThe Gambia has only her river, for the navigation of which sufficient provision is already made by a steamer supplied by the Imperial Government, and supported partly by the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REPRESENTATIVE FOR AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'London, November, 1867.\n\nSir,—To induce a more substantial interest in the government of Western Africa by the Colonial-office; to bring more effectually and unhesitatingly their wants and requirements, as well as their grievances, before the notice of the proper authorities; to effect a thorough and proper government of the poor inhabitants of that unfortunate Coast, and to establish a feeling of interest for them and relating to their affairs in the mind of some of the higher classes of our population, requires a responsible person to be nominated and paid for by the inhabitants of the Coast as their official agent in this country.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.62, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country. All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home.

In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

That man had his own private interest, backed up by Government authority, and he went on pushing his contracts in the name of the Government till he went too far, and, perhaps, trod upon the toes of the English traders. Then representations were made by our traders, communications passed between the foreign Government and our own Foreign Office, and the matter was settled by the foreign Government simply saying that the man had exceeded his instructions. It was necessary, in order to stop that class of agents from going beyond their instructions, to set the English Government to work. The Government of England represented the people, and unless the people formed on opinion, and represented it to the Government, it did not seem to be the duty of the authorities to act. This was a matter in which the large interests of the African section of the chamber were particularly concerned, and they were the people of this country in this particular case. They wished to speak with one mouth through the chamber to the Foreign Office, so that they might request the Government to put a stop to those malpractices. A similar case arose some two or three years ago in the neighbourhood of Lagos, where the French were doing the same thing as they were now doing at Sierra Leone. They tried to get behind the Colony of Lagos, and made a treaty with the King of Abeokuta in order to cut off the stream of trade that came down from the interior to Lagos, and to turn it down to the French territories so that it might be exported from French ports. The chamber sent a deputation to Lord Knutsford, and his lordship had to go to the Foreign Office in order to communicate with the French Government. The result of the negotiations was that the treaty was abandoned, the French Government stating that it was a mistake, the efforts of the French local authorities were rendered futile, and the English were now carrying out their trade very satisfactorily. They addressed the Foreign Office this time on the advice of Lord Knutsford, who had stated at the last deputation that it was necessary to communicate with the French Government through the Foreign Office. He would, however, communicate with the Colonial Office and ask them to send a representative with the deputation to support their claims.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': ""Much as the colonial and the general international environment were broadly the same, the actual expression of African nationalism and politics, phenomena neatly summed up by the Swahili word siasa, varied from place to place, even in territories under the same imperial master. The explanation for this lies partly in the fact that colonial territories were acquired in different ways, at different points in time, and therefore had different experiences of colonialism, lasting for varied lengths of time. Factors which conditioned the form and intensity of action by nationalists (wanasiasa) in the colonies included the type of leadership, the variations in the spread and intensity of European influences in the form of ideas and institutions; the number and significance of the settler (white) population; and, lastly, the colonial ideologies and practices.\nIn nearly all cases, the nationalist movements and the attendant colonial politics were led and dominated by the new western-educated elites who were the best equipped to understand the European political culture and therefore to react effectively to the colonial regimes on the terms enunciated by the latter. Sometimes, they co-operated actively with members of the 'traditional' leadership elites, even if there were tensions in their relations. Such co-operation features in territories like the Gold Coast with the Aborigines Rights Protection Society, in Southern Nigeria, Morocco, and among the Gikuyu of Kenya. In some cases, leadership remained within the ranks of the 'traditional' elites as in Libya and Morocco. In most cases, however, since those who represented or were recruited to represent traditional leadership elites were preferred by colonial regimes as instru› ments of control, the tendency was for the expression of nationalism to involve treating the traditional elites as accomplices and for them to be attacked as such."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

In the Gold Coast and in Egbaland (Nigeria) they had worked closely with the traditional elite in an effort to build a new society and ward off European rule.

The new elites had wrongly hoped that Europe was out to modernize Africa and would use members of their group as the instruments for achieving that goal. But under colonial rule it was European bureaucrats who assumed the role which the new elites had cut out for themselves. And instead of taking the new elites into partnership, the administration tended to prefer the traditional rulers whom they relegated to the area of local government. This was particularly so in British-ruled Africa where a determined effort was made to preserve the old ruling families and to some extent in Belgian-ruled Africa after 1906. Even in the French territories where most of the great paramountcies were destroyed, the old ruling families at times survived in attenuated forms to be used at the village and district levels.

The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""All these guiding principles were made clear, explicitly or implicitly, to the colonial administrators.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

We cannot understand why such a man as Mr. Ross, to whom, with his brother, Cape Coast is indebted for its Church, and who gained as fully the love and affection of the people as Mr. Ussher did their hatred and contempt, should have been so long unemployed on the West Coast, and such men as Colonel Bravo, who has dared to nominate a Mr. Walcott to be Chief Magistrate at the Gambia, and Mr. Ussher, whose particular deeds we need not here chronicle, preferred before him, and petted and supported in all their official and unofficial misdeeds. The fact no doubt is explicable in the practice of Government departments; but having the interests of the West African people deeply at heart, we may at least be permitted to deplore its existence.'}, {'id': 4457, 'article_title': 'Missionary Troubles at Old Calabar', 'full_section_title': 'Missionary Troubles at Old Calabar', 'last_edit_date': '03-24-1882', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1882#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_06_1882', 'content': 'Sir,—I begin with Church affairs, where I ended my November letter to you. The deputation sent out here by the Mission Board to investigate the causes of misunderstanding in the Mission, arrived here on December 1, and worked hard until the 24th, when they intimated their decision to the parties concerned, the substance of which is as follows: ""That two of the native teachers be censured for being too friendly to Mr. Ross; that Mr. Anderson be admonished for helping Orök to write letters home against Mr. Ross, and for having written indiscreet letters to a female agent; and that Mr. Ross return to Scotland,"" &c. At this decision the congregation and Mr. Ross\'s numerous friends were indignant, and asked, ""Why, what evil has he done? Let us hear it!"" That very day the whole session—five teachers and all the church members (a few slaves, ignorant alike of civil and religious liberty, excepted), and Mr. Ross—resigned all connection with the Mission, and reorganized themselves at once into a congregation, and met next day (Sunday) for worship in Prince Eyamba\'s yard. Next day the Henshaw Town chiefs joined the disruption party. This unexpected step, though pre-warned of it, was very mortifying to both deputies and missionaries having an empty church to preach in. One of the former was very ill after he saw the result of their work, and it hastened, if it did not cause, his death on the voyage homewards (for he died near Grand Canary). There is a coloured missionary from Jamaica, with slight knowledge of medicine, in Creek Town, and the deputies acceded to his wish by sending him to Duke Town to help the other missionaries to entice the people back to the deserted church. He has now been over three months at his work, and has not succeeded in bringing a single individual back to the church. The people prefer rather to pay for Mr. Ross\'s teaching and medicines than to have his for nothing. Before the deputies quitted the African shores, Mr. Ross and his congregation were worshipping in the new church built for them by one of their elders, Prince Eyamba. In addition to this noble work, the Prince heartily gave his own new house to Mr. Ross. The Henshaw Town chiefs are building a handsome church for Mr. Ross and his congregation, to which they intend to remove, and use the present church for a schoolhouse. Mr. Ross is a man of an indomitable spirit, great energy, and perseverance, and, being liberated from the annoyance which he has been unjustly subjected for our sakes for the last five years (qualities which we natives admire), we expect soon the new Mission will equal, if not surpass, the old. Already he has two stations in Calabar, and one inland; and he is just now making arrangements to settle two evangelists next month in virgin soil, where he has obtained mission land from the chiefs, as the first missionary they ever saw; and I am sure, Mr. Editor, as a benefactor of my race, you will wish him God-speed! One thing irritated us natives very much in connection with the visit of the deputies—that they never visited a single Christian in Duke Town, Mission Hill, nor Henshaw Town, and would not hear our complaints against some of the missionaries, and treated our several petitions sent home in favour of Mr. Ross with contempt. They visited Orök, notwithstanding his brothel in the creek and at plantation for married European traders. But we Africans as we are, let the deputies and missionaries know that we can think and act for ourselves, and that we are not so easily trampled upon as they suppose. Mr. Ross informs me that he has written and sent home the whole palaver for publication. There is a lull just now in town affairs. We cannot have a king made unless the three families that compose Duke Town agree. The first family, for numerical strength, is the Eyamba; the second, the Archibong; and the third, the Duke.—Yours, &c.,'}, {'id': 4821, 'article_title': 'LAGOS NEWS', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS NEWS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1884#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_04_1884', 'content': '**Farewell Dinner to Lieut.-Governor Griffith, C.M.G.**—Mr. G.

Sir Brandford Griffith was promoted from the Auditor-Generalship of Barbadoes to the Administratorship of Lagos in 1879, with a dormant commission to assume the reins of the general government of the Colony in case of need, and which he did on two occasions: the duties of which he so creditably discharged, that his Sovereign was advised to confirm him in the appointment. It was at first doubted by his detractors (whose name then was legion) as to whether he possessed the high qualifications necessary to administer a Government on whose shoals and sandbanks a few of his predecessors had foundered. But subsequent events, as I hope to endeavour to prove, show that he was not only equal to the occasion, but that he was possessed of administrative qualities of no mean order.\n\nWhen the colony was threatened with a second Ashanti invasion, his diplomatic skill, coupled with the prompt precautions he adopted, nipped it in the bud, and peace once more reigned supreme, where all around would have been bloodshed, ruin, and misery. That was a masterpiece of diplomacy.\n\nThe colonial statute book embodies in its pages volumes of wholesome legislation enacted during his wise administration. The administration of justice had its area enlarged by the introduction of legal men stationed at the various centres, and whose services have been so much appreciated by the general public.\n\nWhen a certain class of irresponsible persons in the Colony attempted to sow seeds of discord between the rulers and the ruled—when credulous and uneducated chiefs and people were duped by promises of a restoration of the infamous domestic slave trade and a total disbandment of the constabulary force, did not their machinations vanish like the morning mist when encountered by the astute and diplomatic Sir Brandford, and did he not effectually silence the tongue of the slanderer and the demagogue?\n\nIt is quite fresh in the memory of many as to the masterly way he unravelled the intricate threads with which gigantic smuggling operations were woven, and how the perpetrators thereof met each with his desert.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/06_07_1891#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. W.

""Vide et Crede"" has, as if by a providential inadvertency, touched on one of the many wounds which have festered and suppurated and have at last settled down into an angry visible sore. I allude to the conflicting, contradictory, senseless action of the Government at Cape Coast at all seasons and under all circumstances. ""Vide et Crede"" states, for example, that Colonel Conran declared the fact, by means of a proclamation, that ""British rule did not exceed 15 miles in the interior."" Colonel Conran, having spoken in this authoritative language, takes his leave of the seat of Government under an inauspicious ovation. As soon as his back is turned, Mr. Usher, who sits in his place, sends a Lieut. Hamilton ""80 or 90 miles into the bush"" to settle some ""petty squabble."" Surely, both of these Administrators cannot be accused of uniformity in their ideas of government. So, again, I remember the day when Mr. Andrews strove, in the heated amiability of his heart and soul, to bring the long line of the Kings of Cape Coast to an end, in order that he might consolidate the functions of the British law within the circuit of the town at least; and I remember the day also when Mr. Pine, moving in an eccentric orbit, fired a salute of twenty-one guns in glorification of the crowning of the very Aggery whose kingship Colonel Conran has flouted with so much martial scorn and has bespattered with so much official mire. Either Mr. Andrews and Colonel Conran were right, or Mr. Pine was right. If Mr. Pine was correct in his royal views and exultation, Aggery is king, and irresponsible in his kingdom to the white man; and if Mr. Andrews and Colonel Conran are no less exact in their estimation of the utility of abolishing the monarchical forms of Cape Coast, Aggery is rightly an exile, because responsible to the local Government for the expression of an offensive, independent opinion, and for the pursuit of an offensive, independent act.\n\nThe chiefs themselves have often complained to me of the difficulty under which they laboured in mastering the wishes of the Government; for, as they have justly remarked, one Governor will say one thing to-day, and another Governor will say another thing precisely the reverse to-morrow.

There has been “a scare,” which is now attributed to the want of local knowledge on the part of the Lieutenant-Governor; but that scare has swept away a surplus of 70,000l., which the colony could but ill spare, and might well have landed this country in an expenditure of many millions. Mr. Griffith can scarcely be blamed for relying upon local representations, for he knows little of the country. Entering the Civil Service when already in his prime, he was appointed Auditor-General of Barbadoes, and remained in that position for sixteen years. There is no reason to doubt that he would have remained in it, or at all events in the island, until the time for retirement came, had not Lord Carnarvon sent out Mr. Pope Hennessy to force Confederation upon the Barbadians. The attempt failed. The island was brought to the brink of civil war, and then the Governor was recalled. Mr. Griffith was one of some four officials who worked with a zeal which sadly lacked discretion to bring about the desired change. The rest were rewarded in different ways, and Mr. Griffith could not be overlooked, so he was made Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast and Administrator of Lagos in 1879, until which time he had had no official experience of a single colony save that of Barbadoes. Is it strange, then, that he should have lost his head in such a place as Cape Coast Castle, when assured by those around him that the King of Ashanti was on the march to Elmina? It is unfair to the mother country, and most unjust to the Colonies to appoint men to administer their affairs who, whatever their merits as individuals or their capacity for different employment, lack the qualifications necessary for the posts to which they are nominated.\n\nThere is great truth and justice in these remarks. Our clever little contemporary, the *Lagos Times*, which devotes itself to local interests, has been loud and persistent in its complaints of the mismanagement of its relation with the interior by Governor Griffiths and his deputy, Captain Maloney, out of sheer ignorance by those officials of the important matters with which they were called upon to deal. If the absurd Ashanti “scare” be instrumental in bringing about this much-needed change of system in making appointments in West Africa, the money and the inconvenience that “scare” has cost the Colonial Treasury and individuals will not have been altogether thrown away. We again repeat that we think the appointment of Sir Samuel Rowe a very good one, and it is a great relief to us to know that he had arrived at Cape Coast on the 4th March to depose from the *chief* authority those weak-kneed officials who have committed such egregious blunders.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1881#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. W.

Mr. Cardwell was a strenuous opponent of the proposition to withdraw the civilising influences of British rule from any of those possessions, except, perhaps, the unfortunate M\'Carthy\'s Island, which has not the advantage of being on the sea coast. We saw, it is true, but too many evidences of the continuance of that red-tapeism which has been the bane of our Colonial-office in its relation with our colonies, but we encouraged in ourselves the belief that with the advent of Mr. Cardwell as Colonial Secretary a new era of official vigilance and activity had really dawned upon West Africa. There were evidences of something resembling the ardour of a new attachment, a desire to master all the difficulties of the position with a seeming view to an impartial and independent application of effective and effectual remedies. But that attachment—for we really believe it existed—had to pass through the proverbial ordeal, ""the course of true love never did run smooth;"" jealous eyes were watching the new-born affection, and plotting the destruction of the hopes it had inspired. The effects of these interpositions soon became visible. The corrupt influences—for all influences are corrupt that have any other end in view than the public advantage—the corrupt influences that had motived bad appointments to the Coast service gathered around their pets: these alone were in the right, and every one who complained of them was in the wrong; these were the salt of the whole Colonial service, and therefore undoubtedly the excellent of the earth; wan and meagre returned Falstaffs who had slain no end of men in buckram while away from England excited pity by their shaken and attenuated frames—as frequently the result of vicious indulgence as of baneful climate; and the Red Tape of the permanent Colonial-office pigeon-holes winding themselves around the Minister checked, controlled, and seem finally to have paralyzed him for that good we had so fondly and so foolishly expected from him. How else are we to account for what has taken and is taking place? In what other way are we to account for the non-despatch of the new code of instructions, whatever they may be, to the Coast until six months after the report of the Parliamentary Committee?—in what other way—to the neglect of all official inquiry into the state and management of the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia—the re-appointment, in direct opposition to the established rules of the service, for a new term of years, of a notoriously incompetent Governor, made still more incompetent by being manifestly under the controlling power of pernicious local influences?—the state of official abandonment in which the Administrative department of the Protectorate Government of the Gold Coast have been allowed to remain? We know of nothing more unfair than the position in which Colonel Conran has been left at Cape Coast. From the moment of his arrival there Colonel Conran set vigorously about those material improvements which ought long since to have accompanied civilised rule, and the neglect of which has been a deep disgrace to the British Government in the Protectorate. We never knew of a West Coast Governor who merited so large a measure of official co-operation and support by the Colonial-office; yet nothing has been done to second his efforts and lighten his burden. Himself only Acting Governor (eating means on half-pay, while some absentee is receiving the other half, and is nominally the occupant of the office, whose duties he may be discharging), he has been surrounded, and for aught we know to the contrary, continues to be surrounded by acting subordinate and judicial officials. The Supreme Court, or Judicial Assessors\' Court, has been allowed to remain for fifteen months under an Acting Chief Justice; during the whole of that period there have been only Acting Colonial Secretaries; for many, many months there has been no chaplain to officiate in the pretty church erected through the praiseworthy zeal and persistency of the brothers Ross. The Colonial surgeon, Dr. Oaks, the only doctor there, is acting; there is an Acting Queen\'s Advocate (a military man), Acting Receiver-General, Collector of Customs, and Post-master, Acting Stipendiary Magistrate, and Inspector of Prisoners, and no Coroner. We repeat, it has been most unfair to have thrown the responsibility of all those appointments upon Colonel Conran, who for the most part, could only employ the meagre military element at his disposal to fill the vacant posts, and has been thus deprived of that support and assistance he was so eminently entitled to. It was resolved by the Parliamentary Committee that our rule in the Protected Territories was not to be abandoned; but a more complete official abandonment has never been perpetrated anywhere. Our letters from the coast with regard to the Chief Justiceship merit especial attention. The pure, and speedy, and enlightened administration of justice among the natives—justice which they cannot obtain in their own native courts—has been the keystone of our influence and power on the Coast; and we do not hesitate to say that it is a grievous neglect of duty on the part of the Colonial-office to have allowed this great civilising agent to lose the prestige by which it was heretofore surrounded, and which was so powerful a support of the Executive Government. The new code of instructions, whatever they may be, has been sent out to the Coast. A Governor-General has gone forth and has made a hasty tour of inspection, or rather of official visits to the colonies and settlements within his jurisdiction; and although we do not and cannot admit that there has been any real valid excuse for the official abandonment we have exposed, we may express the hope that all fancied excuses will now be at an end, and the public service everywhere on the Coast be restored to a state of full efficiency.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'what might be done next year.

These are the sources for the study of, and the periodization for, the history of colonialism in Africa. As far as sources are concerned, the authors and research students enjoy some advantages as well as disadvantages over those of the other volumes. To take the latter first, this volume and Volume VIII cover periods in which, unlike those of the other volumes, part of the archival materials is still inaccessible to scholars. Indeed, some archival material in several metropolitan countries such as that in France for the period up to 1930 was opened to scholars only after some of these chapters had already been completed. Moreover, with the partition and the entry of so many different European powers into Africa, the problem of language that faces research students becomes a difficult one.\nTo compensate for this, more journals and periodicals become available and published parliamentary papers, debates, commissions of inquiries, papers of private companies and associations, and published annual reports become more numerous than in the periods before; all of these are available. Above all, some of the actors in the colonial drama themselves are still alive and can be and have been interviewed. Others, both African and European, have also begun to publish their memoirs and autobiographies or to recall them in novels, plays and learned treatises. In all these respects, the authors of this volume enjoy some advantages over most of the authors of the other volumes.\nFinally, it appears far more research has been and is still being done on the subject of colonialism and far more has been published and is still being published on it than on any other theme in African history. Indeed, within the last ten years, a five-volume history of colonialism in Africa edited by L. H. Gann and Peter Duignan and published by the Cambridge University Press has appeared.

For the first time the whites had a decisive advantage in weapons, and for the first time the railway, the cable and the steamship enabled them to offer some answer to the problem of communication within Africa and between Africa and Europe. It was resistible because of the size of Africa; because of the strengths of its peoples; and because in the event Europe did not deploy very many men or very much technology. True, the whites made up for their shortage of men by recruiting African auxiliaries. But they were not diabolically clever manipulators of divided and outmatched blacks. The Europeans were merely running through the repertoire of old imperial devices. In detail they often knew much less about a situation than African rulers did. The implementation of the strategy of advance was very haphazard and clumsy.

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans.

In North Africa, it was only Algeria that had by 1880 been colonized by the French. Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1).

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation.

Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland. Therefore, distance from the coast was one of the determinants of how early the colonial economy could be set in motion.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860. Everywhere there was movement of labour either to concentrate it in places where it was needed or because some African peoples were regarded as better or more willing workers either because of their longer contact with a commercial economy or because of age-old features of their specific cultures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

To the members of this school such as H. H. Johnston, Sir Alan Burns and, more recently, Margery Perham, Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan,$^{10}$ Africans in fact welcomed the establishment of colonial rule since not only did it save them from anarchy and internecine warfare but it also brought them some concrete benefits. Thus Margery Perham: most of the tribes quickly accepted European rule as part of an irresist› ible order, one which brought many benefits, above all peace, and exciting novelties, railways and roads, lamps, bicycles, ploughs, new foods and crops, and all that could be acquired and experienced in town and city. For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled. ' ' Such ideas are also reflected in the use of such Eurocentric terms as 'pacification', Pax Britannica and Pax Gallica used to describe what amounted to the conquest and occupation of Africa between 1890 and 1914. Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue. Where the European population failed to comprise a critical mass, the Africans had to build a society from a diverse collectivity of individuals who had little more in common than their skin colour and their servility. The adoption of their customs and behaviour by the non-African sector indicated the measure of their success.\nAfricans did not always conform to the society into which they were thrust. For centuries marronage, or the flight from the slave system, existed as an integral aspect of slavery.$^{53}$ In Brazil, the north-east witnessed the establishment of the quilombo of Palmares which lasted almost a century and which was eliminated only with the largest military force ever mounted in the Americas by the Portuguese and Brazilians. Maroon towns existed for equally long periods in Esmeraldas in Ecuador and in parts of the Blue Mountains and the Cockpit Country of Jamaica. Marronage manifested not only the wish to be free, it was an eloquent and visible condemnation of the system of slavery by Africans.\nBy the time African slavery was eliminated in the Americas, the position of the African sector had worsened dramatically from what it had been a century before. The political and economic reconstruction that followed the Civil War in the USA accompanied a movement of legal discrimination and social and economic exclusion of the non-white sector, characterized by segregated institutions, lynchings, and overtly racist societies and organ› izations, which combined until the middle of the twentieth century.$^{54}$ The general conditions experienced by black Americans then compared with those prevailing today in a more extreme way in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

Soon after that the Chief sent some men who pretended to conduct the Bishop to a place from whence he could see the lake. The Bishop most eagerly followed these men, with only one follower. Shortly after, one of the Bishop's men, to his horror and surprise, saw the Bishop and his follower being conducted into the village with their hands tied with ropes, and went to inform his companions of it. There was no more order after that. The Bishop's goods were all ordered to be taken to the Chief's home. Some of the cooking materials were scrambled by the natives. The men, terror-stricken, did not know what to do. The Bishop was asked to wait for an answer from the great Chief. For eight days the Bishop was in confinement, while his men were allowed to go about the place. On the eighth day the messenger returned, and on the same night there was a great deal of drumming and shouting among the natives. When our men asked what was the cause of the shouting among the villagers, they were told that the great Chief had given orders that the Mzungu should proceed on to Uganda to see the great Chief. On the following day all the Bishop's men were disarmed in the morning, after which they were caught and tied two by two together, and confined in different huts. At 5.30 p.m., the Bishop and the men were taken to a bush far away from the village, those who led the Bishop leading the way.

The captain refused to receive the oil, stating that the chairman in this river refused to allow him to receive any oil from us in the town, even from the natives. Since then, I have never been allowed to ship my oil to Liverpool. I did not know what to do; I had written to the agents of the Company, but received no reply. I cannot write to the Consul anything respecting it, as I believe the Consul is all for the Europeans in this river, because the Consul once asked King Jaja why he did not send away every Sierra Leone and Lagos man from his town. The King answered him, how can he drive human beings like himself from his country, since they had done nothing wrong? To this the Consul had nothing to say, only stating that he will not protect us as British subjects. Is this right on the part of Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, to insist on an African king turning out an African born man from his country? Dear Mr. Editor, I will only for the present ask you to notice these great evils in your paper, and try your very best to enable us to ship our palm oil from this river from time to time.

Not many years had elapsed from the time of their arrival before they had succeeded in establishing mission stations both on the island and on the continent, one at Bimbia, about 1844, and another up the Cameroons river about 1846. Three years after the arrival of the first missionaries in Fernando Po, the small missionary band, having by that time increased to about four or five, was considerably augmented and strengthened. On February 16, 1844, a band of missionaries and teachers from Jamaica arrived at Clarence Core in the Chilmark. This noble band, including women and children, consisted of about forty-three persons, the greater number of whom were either black or coloured persons. These were all dispersed and located as was seen necessary. Printing-presses were had out, translations were begun, and the presses set to work. A missionary iron schooner, commanded by a missionary captain, was sent out and placed at the disposal of the missionaries to facilitate evangelical operations, by enabling them to visit the different places that lie along the coast, and thus maintain an unbroken line of communication between the island and the continent. Schools were established, churches formed, and the stations, Clarence especially (which was then the head-quarters), and Bimbia, flourished most wonderfully, and hopes of a very bright future were cherished, but these hopes were, as it were, nipped in the bud. Not that there was a lack of zeal and energy on the part of the workers, for each one, both white and black, did his part most willingly and faithfully. But death, discord, and necessity gradually weakened that strong band, until at the last it was shattered into fragments. Africa is a fatal place for whites. Several of the white missionaries died; one or two of them, owing to discord, felt it necessary to return home and labour somewhere else. As to the blacks, the most numerous body, a few died in Africa, whilst necessity compelled the rest to return to Jamaica. These are reminiscences of the past.

Two years' labour brought him money enough for this purpose, and in March, 1875, he left Kimberley with ten oxen, intending to explore the Zambesi River from the Victoria Falls to its source, and then to push northward, and, if possible, to reach Darfur.

Repeated attacks of fever prevented him from carrying out his ambitious programme, but he was able to explore thoroughly the little-known Merutse kingdom by the help of its sovereign, King Lepopo, whose friendship he gained.

He could not doctor other people, for he was seriously ill himself with the fever he had brought back from the interior. For months he was confined to his tent.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The text discusses the role of colonial intermediaries, such as 'warrant chiefs,' and the tensions between traditional and new elites, illustrating the complexity of colonial administration. It critiques the Eurocentric portrayal of African resistance as irrational, framing it instead as a legitimate struggle for liberation, and focuses predominantly on resistance and criticism, with little mention of admiration for colonial governance. In contrast, The African Times articles present a rich tapestry of observations that both support and refute the claim, showcasing both admiration and criticism. For instance, they describe a grand and respectful reception for the Governor by the people of Anamaboe, highlighting admiration and loyalty towards colonial representatives. Conversely, they reveal significant criticism and dissatisfaction, such as complaints about the administration of justice in Cape Coast and the mismanagement of the Colonial Hospital in the Gambia. The articles also discuss the challenges faced by colonial authorities, such as balancing trade interests with local customs and maintaining order and sanitation in towns like Cape Coast.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Much has been written about the African response to foreign penetration and eventual rule towards the end of the last century and the beginning of the present.

This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions. There were those who took to armed confrontation with the intruders - active resistance. Then there were those who, though they did not take to arms, refused to co› operate with the intruders.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ... As with the slave trade in earlier times, there were gainers as well as losers, and both were to be found within the confines of every colonial territory. ls Ronald E.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The generality of resistance', 'content': ""In 1965 the Soviet historian, A.

The number of young men and women dressed in European style astonished even the old residents. There was a very large sprinkling of young females expensively got up in native attire.

The King and three of his principal chiefs were invited, as also several gentlemen from Cape Coast and Anamaboe. The officers of the Anamaboe Volunteer Rifles were also present in full uniform. The viands and wines were of the most _recherché_ description.

J. Ghartey; the boys and girls of the Wesleyan Mission School, preceded by the Rev. Timothy Laing, native minister. On arriving at the site, his Excellency was met by the King and chiefs with their staff, who had formed a most brilliant procession from another quarter of the town. A silver trowel was presented to his Excellency by Commandant Thomson, and after the usual observances, not forgetting the new coins, his Excellency proceeded to lay the foundation-stone; which done, he delivered a brief but most appropriate speech. The school-children then sang ""God save the Queen,"" and their performance so delighted the Governor, that he caused them to repeat the anthem, at the conclusion of which three cheers were given, and the procession returned in the same order that it had arrived. The weather was most propitious during the whole of the time. During the day many chiefs from different parts of the country in the commandantship of Anamaboe came into town with their retainers and fired salutes and reviewed their men, in honour of the Governor. The proceedings of this day were brought to a fitting conclusion by a _grand \'relish,\'_ or, as you would term it, a _déjeuner à la fourchette,_ in the fort, and the performance of the numerous guests on the occasion bore ample testimony to the fact that they did not come there for mere pastime.

If I have so to speak in explanation of my not feeling at liberty to second the first resolution in its entirety, as had been, I believe, intended, and in no way in justification of any act of my own, I must, at the same time, say I am heartily in accord with the object and aim of this body, as regards its noble and untiring efforts for the protection of Africans, either against themselves or against others.\n\nI can, perhaps, console myself, too, that I have not yet, so far as I know, got within reach of the lash of the criticism of this Society.

But they all relate to past abuses, upon which we have sufficiently enlarged, until we obtain the evidence of new facts to prove, either that the publicity we have given to complaints has been ineffective for producing reform and amendment, which are the only objects we have in view, or have instigated to those desired changes which will give a guarantee, or at least a hope, of future good government and administration, such as the natives and inhabitants of the colony have a right to enjoy. We cannot too fully or too often impress upon our native correspondents that we have no personal animosities whatever as regards the inculpated authorities; that our self-imposed mission is to do good for Africa and the African people; and that if we can succeed in this, we obtain the sole object of our desires. While, therefore, we require constant information as to the acts of the authorities and their bearing upon the public welfare, we recommend most earnestly the cultivation of a good feeling between authorities and people as being most pregnant with benefits for the latter. Of course this can never exist where there is a constantly expressed evident contempt and hatred of the African, and we therefore earnestly implore those who are in positions of trust and influence to show on every occasion that kindness and consideration which everywhere win regard, and in no part of the world more surely than in Africa. In this they will only be doing their duty. The African colonies and settlements are not kept up by this country with an object of pecuniary advantage, but to assist in the protection and advancement of the so long oppressed and wasted African people; and British authorities who are not friendly to the African people are acting disgracefully in opposition to the spirit of the Government under which they hold their appointments.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental. A brutal Colonial Governor among savages is the worst possible enemy of the State he represents, and he does more to sap its authority than all the witch doctors put together.

Instead of the 150 prisoners of the official report, there were, according to my informant, only twelve or fifteen. Weary, wounded, half-starving, covered with bruises and sores, these few—mostly old women, greybeards, and children—were landed from the ship and beaten and shoved in fetters to the prison.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

In the first place, thanks to the activities of European explorers and missionaries, Europeans were by 1880 far more knowledgeable about Africa and its interior - its physical appearance, terrain, economy and other resources and the strength and weakness of its states and societies - than Africans were about Europe.\nSecondly, owing to the revolutionary changes in medical technology and in particular the discovery of the prophylactic use of quinine against malaria, Europeans became far less fearful of Africa than they had been before the middle of the nineteenth century. 57 Thirdly, as a result of the uneven nature of the trade between Europe and Africa up to the 1870s, and even after, as well as the increasing pace of the industrial revolution, the material and financial resources available to Europe were overwhelming in comparison with those of Africa.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium. Major Christian missionary bodies such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of the Church of England and the Lyons-based SociØtØ des Missions Africaines (SMA) of the Roman Catholic Church each employed a mix of European nationals. Father Boghero, who led the SMA in an effort to re› introduce Roman Catholic Christianity to West Africa in the nineteenth century, was an Italian. The pioneer SMA Fathers in most parts of the area which became Nigeria were French, just as it was such British missionaries as Thomas Birch Freeman of the Methodists and Samuel Ajayi Crowther of the CMS who pioneered the work of Christian missions in what was to become French Dahomey (present-day People's Republic of Benin).$^{33}$ British, French, German and Portuguese traders set up businesses adjacent to one another and, as the case of Badagry clearly demonstrated, there were residential quarters for diverse European nationals in the major ports all along the coast of the Bight of Benin.\nTraders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease. Indeed, for Europe, the timing of the conquest could not have been better; for Africa it could not have been worse."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited. Both Germany and, especially, Britain were able to wield all the influence they wanted, and no statesmen in their right senses would have freely elected to incur the costs, and court the unforeseen contingencies of formal annexation when they could derive the same advantages from informal control. 'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

As we have seen above, the fundamental issue at stake between the 1880s and the 1900s as far as the African rulers were concerned, was that of sove› reignty, and on this, it was quite clear that nobody was prepared to compromise. Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

The treaty cedes to Rogozinski, for the sum of £55, the territory of Bota from the western frontier of Victoria to Cape Dange, the king and his people being allowed certain rights of settlement, but being bound to have no dealings with any outsiders. Bota lies in Ambas Bay, at the foot of Mount Cameroon; and Rogozinski intended, if this affair were successful, to buy the more inland territory of Boando. He does not propose to erect a factory, but to leave the trade to Frenchmen, and to attract colonists. He is acting on his own behalf, and is known as strongly anti-German. On August 28th last Rogozinski and the King and Chiefs of Bota concluded with Captain Arthur Furlonger, acting on behalf of Consul Hewett, a treaty accepting British protection, and binding themselves not to treat with other Powers without English sanction, the treaty to take effect from the moment of signing.'}]","[{'document_title': ""HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION."", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""**Herr Rogozinski**, who for the last three years has been engaged in exploring the vicinity of the Cameroons mountains, with the view of discovering a river in the interior which eventually empties itself into the Congo, has just returned to England. He was formerly a Lieutenant in the Russian Navy, and early in 1883 sailed from France in his own vessel, the *Lucy et Marguerite*, for the West Coast of Africa. Arriving at the coast, he met the Swiss expedition, and with them arranged to take simultaneous observations, one party being on the Cameroons Peak and the other in the bay. While with the latter party, Herr Rogozinski's canoe got capsized, and Dr. Retzer, of the Swiss expedition, was drowned. Some very valuable scientific instruments were also lost by the accident. In the July he started for the river Libre, where he met with much opposition from the natives of Mokonyeh, who would not allow the explorers to pass. Another tribe from Beffarenganya, who brought trade from the interior to a town nearer the coast, were more friendly, and wanted the explorers to visit their country. They brought 600 men, and a battle took place between them and the Mokonyeh people. The latter were victorious, as their following numbered 1,500; and Rogozinski had again to betake himself to the coast. About this time his companion, M. Tomczek, discovered the Rio del Rey. They had been six months in the interior, and early in 1884 they returned to the coast. M. Rogozinski was now master of the native language, and travelled everywhere with the utmost freedom. Indeed, so much respect did the natives show him that they put him on a level with their great chief or king. His power extended for miles inland, and on the coast from Ambas Bay to the Rio del Rey. The natives proclaimed him Chief of Bota; and while about to arrange for the exploration of the interior, M. Rogozinski heard of the German designs on the Cameroons. The annexation of the Cameroons river was soon after an accomplished fact. Subsequently H.M.S. Forward and Consul Hewitt arrived at Ambas Bay, and requested M. Rogozinski to put his territory of Bota under the British protection. This he did, and further went in the Forward and made treaties for England from Ambas Bay to the Rio del Rey. This was a work of several days, and just as the treaty was being signed in the last town, two German war vessels came into the bay. Their object was to annex the territory which had then been handed over to England, and the officers of the war vessel could not hide their chagrin when they saw they had been forestalled. After this the Germans endeavoured to get behind the territory of the English, apparently with the view of cutting off communication from the interior. The natives became alarmed at this, and Consul White, of Old Calabar, visited Ambas Bay, and asked Rogozinski to go into the interior and make treaties with the natives, at the same time appointing him as British Vice-Consul. Herr Rogozinski made treaties with the interior chiefs, and eventually came upon the Germans. Subsequently the arrest of Rogozinski was ordered if found in German territory, and soon afterwards M. Yanekonski, his companion, was arrested by the Germans in mistake for him, until a note from the shore from Rogozinski himself soon put matters right. While Herr Rogozinski was up the country making treaties, the Germans landed at one place—a mile in extent—and this they annexed, being the only place between Ambas Bay and Rio del Rey which was not taken over by England. A few months ago he received a Blue-book from England which showed him that Count Herbert Bismarck had visited London, and that the country which Rogozinski had got under British protection had been given to Germany in exchange for some little territory near the Gold Coast Colony. When this startling news reached M. Rogozinski he left, as according to the order issued he was liable to arrest. He did not receive any intimation from the British authorities of their intention, nor yet a word of thanks for his efforts on their behalf.

Herr Rohlfs commences his article with a notice of the annexation by Queensland of the island of New Guinea, thus adding something like 800,000 square kilometres—or a territory one-third larger than Germany—to the British rule. This does not at all alarm him, for he candidly admits that Germany does not care much about colonizing, and he is glad to see so beautiful an island come into the possession of England. The writer then proceeds to give a sketch of De Brazza and Stanley on the Congo. The former seeking to plant the French flag in Central Africa, the latter undertaking the benevolent rôle of founding an international association, under the auspices of the King of the Belgians. De Brazza, he quickly dismisses with the remark that he considers his undertaking a forlorn hope. He is unable to convince himself that France has sufficient superfluous strength to allow of her planting colonies, and in this particular instance he foresees that the manner in which Stanley\'s expedition has been founded and is supported, will give him almost unlimited resources in men and money. Germany must wish success to the King of the Belgians for his undertaking is international and all can benefit by his benevolent action. Herr Rohlfs next reviews the conduct of Portugal and gives a lively sketch of this nation rousing herself from her long lethargy and putting forward claims that have been buried in the mists of three centuries of inaction. He pertinently remarks that during these long ages Portugal never had any possessions in the actual interior, and on the coast she attended very little to the development of any trade but that of stealing and selling men. Now, however, she puts forward a claim that would virtually give her the control of the whole country watered by the magnificent stream of the Congo, a river which she never discovered further than its mouth, but which Stanley has lately given to the world. Herr Rohlfs is surprised at the supineness of our Foreign Office which was nearly inclined to listen to the demands of Portugal—for what reason he cannot imagine, unless it were jealousy of France—(eifersüchtig auf Frankreich). He then gives a graphic sketch of the opposition to this proposed treaty which was raised throughout England by Chambers of Commerce and other bodies, and gives prominent position to the steps taken by the ""influential Anti-Slavery Society"" to instruct and inform public opinion on this great question. He also reviews at some length the various short pamphlets circulated in reply to the pretensions advocated so strongly by the Lisbon Geographical Society, and then proceeds to inquire what is the position that Germany should assume with regard to the internationalization of the Congo. He admits that Germany has hitherto been passive, but in eloquent terms he now calls upon her to be so no longer. Quoting the words of an English pamphlet, that ""if Germany will join England, then France, Italy, and Portugal must follow, and the Congo will be saved,"" he adds that this is devoutly to be wished, and concludes his forcible articles with the words, ""Freedom to the navigation of the Congo under the protection of international laws, this must be our watchword!', 'last_edit_date': '1883-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1883#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GERHARD ROHLFS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A correspondent of the *Basler Nachrichten*, who dates from Cairo, November the 5th, states that when he was in Massowa he heard a strange report about the famous African explorer, Privy Councillor Dr. Gerhard Rohlfs.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs.

F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain.

There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION."", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""## HERR ROGOZINSKI'S WEST AFRICAN EXPEDITION."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN EXPLORATION', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Berlin, Oct. 20.—Major von Mechow will shortly start by sailing vessel from Rotterdam to succeed Dr. Lohde, who is in ill health, in the military command of the scientific expedition which left Europe in June, 1873, under the leadership of Dr. Gussfeldt, for the exploration of Central Africa.

This at least may be inferred from an account of the experiences of Henri Rochefort, junior, the eldest son of the editor of the Intransigeant. Young Rochefort (who is only twenty-two years of age), after twelve months\' military experience under the French flag in Algeria, obtained permission at the beginning of the current year to accompany the De Brazza Expedition. Of the forty other members of the expedition who left France, only ten are still with their leader; two are dead, and the rest are scattered over the country, entirely broken down in health. Rochefort was attacked with fever as soon as he reached the Congo, and has never since been quite free from it. M. de Brazza appointed him the head of the station at Loango, leaving seventeen Senegalese riflemen under his charge. At first all went well; but the Portuguese are said to have excited the negroes against the mission, and in the end Rochefort and his party had to sustain ""a terrible attack."" Victory remained with the French commander, but the lives of five of his men were sacrificed. The only other special achievement by Rochefort, apparently, was the rescue of thirty of the wives and as many of the slaves of a defunct native chief. These unfortunates had been condemned to undergo the trial by poison which is one of the rites practised on the death of a native, and which invariably results fatally. Rochefort and his men charged the tribe with the bayonet, but, strange to say, the intended victims, and particularly the women, were absolutely furious with their rescuers. Referring to the hardships endured by the expedition, the Figaro says, the truth is that De Brazza left home without money. The Franco-Italian explorer, it appears, laughs at obstacles, and is so absorbed with ""the spirit of conquest"" that he thinks neither of meat, drink, nor clothing. The fact that young Rochefort has returned in a state of extreme prostration, coupled with the ominous rumours concerning De Brazza himself which have lately obtained currency, suggests that the narrative from which we have been quoting is not an over-drawn picture of the experiences of the expedition as a whole.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The colonial system itself also became consolidated during the period, and the authoritarianism and racialism of the system became even more evident. It was during this period that the alliance between the African traditional rulers and the colonial masters was strengthened and various ordinances were introduced which greatly increased the powers of these rulers and virtually eliminated the new educated elite and professional groups from participation in the administration of their own countries.\nWhat made this factor all the more explosive was the fact that the period saw a substantial increase in the size of this educated elite and the professional group, following the spread of western education locally and the education of more and more people overseas. In the rural areas also, the spread of the cultivation of cash crops such as cocoa and groundnuts led to the emergence of an increasing number of young men and women who became even richer than the traditional rulers and therefore resented not only the non-traditional and authoritarian powers conferred on their chiefs but their elimination from the new state councils of the so-called native authorities.

Trade in foodstuffs was to be centralized in certain towns, a detailed list of market prices and trade fees was to be drawn up, the export of fish and game from Kwahu was prohibited and rules governing marriages, family responsibilities in debt cases, funerals, adultery by chiefs, etc., were laid down. As J. Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period. Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

As with Major Blackall, so with Colonel D'Arcy, we have no quarrel save on public grounds; but whatever may be the amiability of character of the late Governor of the Gambia, a man who could allow himself to fall so entirely under the rule of others as to induce him to permit the continuance, year after year, under his very eyes, and with his perfect cognizance, of such disgraceful practices as existed, and as we were reluctantly compelled to expose the existence of in the hospital at Bathurst, cannot be fit for the post of Governor-General of the West Coast. We see no evidence anywhere in his published dispatches of that grasp of mind which the duties of such a post require, and in which his predecessor, Major Blackall, has been so lamentably deficient. In one thing, however, Colonel D'Arcy differs greatly from Major Blackall. He is not a real hater of the African race, as Blackall is; and although he stretched his authority in a very unjustifiable way to screen Staff-Assistant-Surgeon Elliott and Dr. Oakes in the matter of their disgraceful attack on Mr. Finden, and at one time jeopardised the public peace and security by his threats of proclaiming martial law at Bathurst, when the only conspiracy against which the measure could be directed was in his own weak or speculating brain, we do not believe he would wilfully do them wrong. Again, Colonel D'Arcy did, we conscientiously believe, try to make some sanitary reforms and improvements at Bathurst. Now such reforms are urgently required at Freetown and elsewhere in Sierra Leone, and he might possibly do some good in that direction; he has spoken in favour of public education at Bathurst, he might then see a way to diminish the police charge by four or five thousand a-year, and devote this, under the sanction of the Home authorities, to education and to sanitary reform; and in all this he would prove himself far superior to Major Blackall.

The French population of the Colony had an affection for the Queen, but they had a great dislike to the Bureau Coloniale in London. What really the Colonies wanted was to have the management and control of their own local government. They thought they could transact their own business better than other people—better, even, than the Colonial Office in London. One certain remedy for the discontent that prevailed was to give to the Colonists far more control than was now permitted them over their own affairs.

The Colonial Office, whether rightly or wrongly, was very unpopular in the West Indies and in our West African possessions, and in his opinion one great cause of that unpopularity was to be found in the fact that the department in London was not strong enough to deal with the large and important mass of business that came before it from the Colonies. No doubt they had a highly-trained body of men in the Colonial Office, some of them men of first-class ability; but then the total staff, including the Permanent Secretary, Assistant-Secretaries, and clerks, only numbered forty-eight. One grievance which the Crown Colonies had was in the matter of patronage, for all appointments, except those of over £200 a year, rested with the Colonial Office.

The Tide Surveyor examined the manifest, and, among other items of cargo, saw a large quantity of shingles. These he knew were in great request in the town, as the rainy season was setting in, and the roofs of the houses of many people required repairing. He asked the supercargo, Captain Ryder, his price for the shingles, was told, and then purchased the lot, 55,000, thus being enabled to rule the market, as no one else had shingles in Bathurst. The vessel was duly entered, and the shingles landed by this Customs official, and he resold about 25,000 to the Engineer Department, and disposed of the balance, 30,000, in small lots, at a good profit, to various people in the town, who had to purchase them at any price, as the roofs of their houses leaked. Now, is it a fair thing that officials, whose salaries amount to hundreds per annum, should be free to compete with and injure the shopkeepers of Bathurst?\n\nIt has been a common thing for all kinds of provisions, clothing, also liquors, cigars, &c., to be purchased on board of the mail steamers by officials from the Custom House, brought on shore in the Customs' boat, taken up to the houses of the officials by the Customs' boat's crew, and what was not wanted for the use of the purchasing official, retailed to the people in the town, much under the price such articles could be sold at in the shops at a profit. Business here is very dull; the shops are just turning over the capital, and perhaps paying expenses, the shopkeepers making just a bare living. Is it right that such living should be further reduced by the private trade of officials?\n\nThe best remedy would be for the Colonial Office to send out instructions to the Administrator here to make all present and future officials subscribe to a declaration, setting forth that they are not, or will not be engaged in any trade, calling, or occupation, outside the sphere of their official duty, and that they do not, and will not, hire or engage anyone to carry on any such trade, calling or occupation on their sole or for joint behalf.\n\nWhat with officials of the Courts practising as attorneys, Customs and other officials trading, things here are in a far from satisfactory state.—I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,"", 'last_edit_date': '1881-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ACCRA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have complaints from Accra that one who at least calls himself a European, and who is designated to us as an ""Overseer,"" is not pursuing that course of propriety and upright performance of duty which would reflect credit on the Government by whom he has been appointed.

They then tried to force an entrance into the house of a Mrs. Smith, who is stated to be a respectable elderly person. Not being able to force the gate, they scaled the wall (12 feet high), broke open the back and front doors of the house, and, having thus entered, shouted their wild ""hurrahs.""

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

Nine times out of ten the whole thing is a sham; Mr. So-and-so, who happens to possess some influence among the natives, undertakes the business at the instance of the individual whose praise the testimonial or address is to proclaim, and fear, or interest, or good nature does the rest. We do not mean to say that the testimonial to Admiral Patey\'s merits addressed to Earl Granville by Mr. Reffles, which appears in this paper, thus originated, or was thus obtained or given; we believe, on the contrary, that it has been motived by real feeling—feeling not so much in favour of Admiral Patey as in anger against the persons who are therein denounced as enemies of the African people. The Ordinance alluded to in that letter was fully exposed and condemned by us at the time; we showed its bitter injustice, and the insincerity and deception of its preamble; and were not sparing in our exposure and rebuke of those from whose devices (and for the furtherance of whose ends) it emanated. But we cannot see why this letter should have been written, and sent to us for publication at the present time, except it is to remind us once more of the difficulties in our work proceeding from the Africans themselves. We have never complained of Admiral Patey in his general conduct toward the African people in the colony, although we should have done so had it been earlier reported to us, of his compelling free hired labourers to work on the prison treadmill when there was not a sufficient number of prisoners to work it. Nor can we see why the mere assertion that Admiral Patey is agreeable to Mr. Reffles, who has been some eighteen months away from Bathurst, and his friend, should be so satisfactory to the Colonial-office. There is no denial, no disproof, in the letter of any of the allegations against Admiral Patey, either as regards the occurrences in the gaol of Bathurst, or his conduct in the matter of the outbreak of cholera, during which some 1,500 poor African victims found graves in the Admiral\'s cholera pits. It is no answer to these allegations that Messrs. Brown and Kneller have never been known as true friends of the African people, but have been systematically among their oppressors. Here, at least, was an occasion in which (we care not what their secret motives may have been, but can only hope they were to vindicate the claims of outraged humanity, and, as members of the Legislative Council, to protest against their being held in any degree responsible for the fatal course of conduct which they exposed)—here, at least, we say was an occasion on which these persons did come forward as friends of the African people. And having the true interests of Africa at heart, how did we meet them? We did not hurl the past at them, nor sneeringly ask, ""Is Saul also among the Prophets?"" but in view of the awful misdoings against the African people which they exposed, we held out to them the hand of fellowship, rejoicing to believe that the day was approaching—a day which we have always predicted must come—when European merchants on the Coast would make common cause with the educated Africans for mutual defence and protection against the aberrations of authorities who are practically irresponsible, because the Colonial-office gives them its private ear, and determinedly upholds its favourites; as in the flagrant case of Mr. Ussher, who, month after month, insults the people of the Gold Coast and Cape Coast, by announcing his immediate return to reassume his authority over them. The impunity of Government officials on the Coast has arisen in a great measure from the Europeans and educated and other natives forming two distinct camps. But this must soon cease. The interests of the educated natives and of the European mercantile residents are substantially the same; the educated natives are now too large and too rapidly-increasing a class—increasing both in numbers and wealth, to be oppressed and domineered over by the Europeans by aid of any corrupt alliance between the latter and the Government officials, and we have been looking therefore with earnest interest at the deepening symptoms of a union for the effectual curbing of administrative and legal tyranny, and securing good, honest, enlightened, and economical government. And we recommend this to the serious consideration of our African friends at the Gambia. We have nothing to do, nor have they anything to do, with the question whether those who have exposed the fatal administrative acts and errors of Admiral Patey have been actuated by some other unacknowledged motives, and not alone by those of justice and humanity, as they allege. What they have done has been done for Africans, and not in opposition to some effort of Admiral Patey for the benefit of Africans. If Mr. Reffles and his friend could have put their finger upon some attempted administrative acts of Admiral Patey for the great benefit of the Africans at the Gambia, could have shown that these had raised the ire of the European merchants, and that the charges brought against Admiral Patey by the latter originated only in this, and had no other object than to prevent the Africans from receiving such great benefits, then they would have made out a prima facie case which would necessarily have thrown a grave suspicion upon those who are now called Admiral Patey\'s enemies. But they have not shown this, and until they do show it, or until the alleged facts which tell so heavily against Admiral Patey are disproved, we must continue to assert that Admiral Patey ought to be removed from his post of Administrator of the Gambia. We know that in consequence of the accusations and complaints, beneficial changes have been made by Admiral Patey; but these have nothing to do with the previous charges and complaints, save partially to establish their truth. Those accusations still stand out grimly before us with their ghastly array of alleged facts, hitherto only denied but not at all disproved; and it rests with Admiral Patey entirely to disprove them (which we do not see how he can do) before he or anyone else; European or African, is entitled to ask that he may be continued in the office he holds.*', 'last_edit_date': '1869-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1869#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I met in St. Louis an English-born Freetown negress who told me that, having a dispute about property in Freetown, she had gone to law there.

I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The General History of Africa does not specifically address James Town or Governor Pine's administration in that context, but it does mention a poll tax instituted by Pine in 1852, which faced strong resistance due to the misallocation of revenue—most of which went to pay civil servants rather than being used for schools and roads. This led to the tax's abandonment in 1864, reflecting broader dissatisfaction with decisions misaligned with local interests. However, the textbook does not explicitly discuss corruption or mismanagement in James Town. In contrast, The African Times provides detailed accounts supporting the claim, highlighting issues such as the accumulation of offices by a single individual, the influence of commercial agents over government appointments, and discontent among the Eastern Districts due to perceived abuses of power. Governor Pine is criticized for his handling of the Ashantee war and decisions like the imposition of fines under the Rum and Spirit Licence Ordinance, which seemed misaligned with local interests. The articles also note dissatisfaction with frequent changes in governors, leading to inconsistent policies and a lack of trust in the government's ability to implement reforms. Additionally, there is a broader dissatisfaction with the colonial administration's failure to address local needs and the perception that the British government was in a false position on the Gold Coast.

The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation.

In Uganda, by 1920, there were 328 elementary schools in Buganda and only 34, 24 and practically none in the Western, Eastern and Northern provinces respectively.$^{37}$ Facilities for education were so inadequate and so unevenly distributed, because the colonial powers did not aim at pro› moting education for its own sake or for the sake of the Africans, but rather, to quote one African scholar, 'to produce Africans who would be more productive for the [colonial] system'. 38 Besides its grossly inadequate nature numerically and its uneven dis› tribution, the curricula provided by all these institutions were determined by the colonial rulers and were closely modelled on, if not carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan countries and therefore irrelevant to the needs of the continent. No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""Let me illustrate this theme from the results of the limited research that has been conducted so far in Ghana.$^{17}$ The inter-war period was characterized in the Gold Coast, as in the other British colonies in West Africa, by the establishment and consolidation of the system of indirect rule in the rural areas through the introduction of a number of ordinances and acts - the Native Jurisdiction Amendment Ordinance of 1910, the Guggisberg Constitution of 1925, the Native Administration Ordinance of 1927 and the Native Administration Revenue Bill of 1931. All these measures which gave the traditional rulers powers to collect revenue and to impose court fines as were unknown before, were, according to Stone, 'an attempt to make the chiefs a living part of the machinery of (colonial) government'. Economically, the era saw the alternation of periods of boom with those of recession and inflation - the latter in 1915-17, 1929-30 and the second half of the 1930s. It also saw the spread of the cocoa industry into the rural areas especially of Akuapem and Akyem Abuakwa which led to the emergence of an increasing number of rich young farmers and long-distance traders. Socially, the period also saw the spread of elementary education into the rural areas and while some of the products of these schools drifted into the urban centres, others stayed behind and took to either farming or petty trading. With all these changes in their socio› economic status, these rural people began to demand a corresponding change in their political status and especially representation on the state and provincial councils, a demand which the ordinances mentioned above made steadily impossible. The principal objectives of the rural folk, then, were to acquire representation on these councils and, above all, to curb the increasing powers of their traditional rulers and the district commis› sioners and abolition or reduction of some of the fines and taxes being imposed by them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools. Having lost the traditionality of their positions and roles in the eyes of their people, they were treated in most cases like mere instruments of control by the colonial masters and not as real partners.

It is interesting to note that the action of the asafo was precipi› tated by the decision of the Akyem Abuakwa State Council to approve the Native Administration Revenue measure proposed by the Colonial administration which was to give the council power to impose a levy on its subjects. As Simensen has shown, the list of charges preferred against the Omanhene show 'an increased awareness of the commoners that many of their troubles arose from the fact that the chiefs were being integrated into the administrative structure of the Colonial Government, and thereby removed from popular control'.$^{20}$ Thus the action of the asafo was directed as much against the colonial administration as it was against the traditional rulers. It is significant that it was only the timely intervention of the colonial rulers that saved Ofori Atta himself, though he conceded some of the demands by, for instance, admitting three members of the Akyem Abuakwa Scholars Union to the State Council in 1933.\nThe other method that the rural folk adopted was the use of cocoa hold› ups. Thus in 1921-2, 1930-1 and again in 1937-8, the cocoa farmers, led by John Kwame Ayew and Winifried Tete-Ansa, both educated men, refused to sell their cocoa until better prices were paid.$^{21}$ The 1937-8 hold-up, which had the support of some of the traditional rulers including the paramount chief of Akyem Abuakwa, Nana Sir Ofori Atta, was particularly widespread, and has been described by Hopkins as 'the last and most significant demonstration of rural discontent before World War II'.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion.

When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him.

By a note to the last-mentioned letter, our readers will see that Governor Pine has immediately consented to hold a Court of Inquiry into these charges. We do not intend to anticipate the result by any further observations. Although if all the statements in letter No. 1 be true, there would seem to have been some negligence or oversight on Governor Pine\'s part, and we should, therefore, were we in a similar position, have preferred to invite or request Commodore Wilmot to hold the said court, we have nevertheless every reason to believe that, under Governor Pine, the inquiry will be impartially conducted. The official report will be laid before our readers in due course. Our position is clear in the matter. So soon as the charges reached us, we placed them in the hands of Her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for the Colonies, refraining from all publication of them, until we should receive from other quarters such a confirmation of the general charge as would justify our inserting them in our columns.

We have before alluded to the composition of the Legislative Council—a Council composed of four commercial agents of one London firm. In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office.

I can only say, as Mr. Fechter says in the play of ""The Duke\'s Motto,"" ""I am here.""\n\nI must thank ""Cape Coast""—and I do so heartily—for his estimation of my skill in unwinding tangled skeins of official thread, but I am sadly afraid that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has at his call more men of high mental attainments and of singular administrative acuteness than my good friend in Africa dreams of; and I am as sadly afraid that the day is far off indeed when I shall be invoked to mend the ways of a Government which is, without exception, the most difficult in the gift of the Crown. Were I as wise as the serpent and as long-suffering as Job, the Government of the Gold Coast would still exhaust my experience, and would overtax my patience too.\n\nI have been provoked to the expression of an opinion. I think, then, that the tangible faults of the Government of the Gold Coast are these:—\n\n1. The changes of the governors are too frequent. The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nKotobarbie, near Accra, May 21, 1867.\n\nDear Sir,—I wrote you lately informing you of the Governor-General\'s call at Accra, _en route_ to Lagos on his annual official visit.

Those whose passage money by the mail steamers must be defrayed out of their private resources are remarkably free from this strange disease.\n\nThe Governor-in-chief being, therefore, unable to come on shore, a deputation of European and native merchants, headed by Nicol Irvine, Esq., J.P., waited on him on board his yacht.

Allow me, therefore, Mr. Editor, place for a few words? Is Governor Pine a man whose principles are opposed to peace? Is he much in fault? Has his administration deserved the insinuations, the sneers, and the blame heaped upon it? Could any official that we have yet known, do better than he has done in this Ashantee trial? We say, No. In our humble opinion, he is not to blame in anything with regard to this state of affairs, any more than it was in the power of any human being to overrule the course of things, or undo the wrong acts and avert the necessary consequences of past irregular Administrations? Do they who thus inconsiderately impugn the present Administration, bear in mind how very short a time this functionary had been on the Gold Coast and assumed the reins of government, before the invasion of our territories by the Ashantees took place? Is it not generally known on this Coast that the late sudden incursion had for its ostensible as well as real object the capture of Agiman, chief of eastern Akim? Now, let us quote General Owosookokoh\'s own words, in answer to the Governor\'s message as regards his cousin\'s (or father\'s) real object in ordering him to attack the Protectorate: ""My father,"" says the Ashantee general, ""has been insulted by Agiman, and for this reason he sent me down to take him to Coomassie."" Here we find no mention was made, not even an allusion to ""Gwanin,"" whose protection by the Governor some regard in a light so unfavourable. Then let us see how this *coup de main* of the lynx-eyed Quako Duah, King of the Ashantees, had been rendered easy by former maladministration (with which Governor Pine could never have anything to do except to be unjustly taxed for the results). A case comparatively trifling in the origin, and which, had it been timely looked into, would have saved much trouble and bloodshed, was shamefully mismanaged; and consequently terminated in a civil war between this Agiman and his nephew King Attah, of the Akims. After this bloody display of animosity, a disunion of course took place between these chiefs of Akim, which event was allowed to pass almost unnoticed in the proper quarters until very lately, when our present Governor, becoming aware of this gross neglect of his predecessor, and of the state of things at Akim, sent commissioners to arrange the dispute, which endangered the peace and safety of the whole Protectorate. We need scarcely add that had this want of unity between Agiman and Attah been prevented in time, the Ashantees would not have dared to make any such pretensions, much less to strike a blow, seeing that they understand very well the strength of the whole Akim in unity. The cowardly circumstances connected with the inroads of the Ashantees in 1853, and the sequel, clears off any doubt on this matter. They detained Captain Brownell in their camp. Essiamowah Quantah, their general, who dared not come nearer than Fosoway (fifty-two miles from the Coast), was afraid to let go so important a security as Captain Brownell\'s person until he saw his own army safely back at the other side of the Praah. And why was this general afraid to make a bold front when he found he could not coolly secure the object of his expedition, as did General Owosookokoh with impunity in the late campaign? Simply, because united Akim, on the side of the Protectorate, rendered his position rather too dangerous to attempt anything like that. But we say such a thing has been attempted latterly, and with success, too, by another Ashantee general, in the very heart of the country, within only a few hours\' journey from the Coast; and how? Simply, because Akim was dissevered, Agiman of eastern Akim at variance with his head, and thus the culpable negligence of a former Governor afforded Owosookokoh the chance of striking us and withdrawing in safety. How, then, is Governor Pine to blame in this matter? Why is this war ludicrously styled Pine\'s war? Governor Pine, unlike many of his predecessors, is faithful to his trust. Like David of old, he is a kind shepherd, that would on no account whatever leave the sheep at the mercy of the bear. Was it not his duty to snatch devoted Agiman and the rest of the protectorate from the paw of the Ashantee lion? As the representative of the protector of this protectorate, would it not have been considered rather a disgrace if he had denied Gwanin the protection he sued for? Is he, then, to be abused and depreciated in the estimation of the public just because he could not do everything—overrule the course of events and exceed the limits assigned to man? For our part, we do not believe in any such *superhumanum*. We only know this much of Governor Pine, that if his counsels, proposals, and plans were encouraged and carried out, this country would be strong against its usual enemies in time of war and improve in time of peace. This expression of our opinion dates so late as the 13th August, 1864. We do not, therefore, think it prematurely expressed: whereas we have yet to learn definitely in what Governor Pine has been to blame—his conduct in the Ashantee affair considered. Until this is demonstrated, our opinion remains unshaken by the sneers of disaffected men. Governor Pine has won most hearts in the community by his own merits. Most of the kings and chiefs of the Gold Coast like and love him. Merchants, respectable men and women of sound principles, love him—very unimportant few do otherwise, the majority of whom are of his skin, who perhaps do so abuse and misrepresent his administration out of the merest grudge.

A few months ago the process-server of the Court embezzled, I think, 40l., and bolted out of the colony; the Government made his surety pay the amount. Now the man is back in Bathurst, walking about in daylight, and nothing is done to him. Later still, a lawyer, named Roberts, forged a will of a man who had just died. The forgery was committed alongside of the corpse; he got witnesses to witness that will, then got them afterwards to swear to its authenticity. This will would have left the man's widow penniless, but she disputed it. When the case came on in court, one of the witnesses got frightened, and made a clean breast of it. It was then proved that Roberts had drawn and forged the will, and got 7l. for doing so; that the witnesses to the will were all particeps criminis, and had also perjured themselves. Well, in such cases it is usual to give the delinquents into custody on the spot; any judge in England would do so, as the crime was proved in his presence in open court. But in this case the practice is different. Roberts is told he is suspended from practice, and leaves the court, and a warrant for his apprehension is delayed being issued, though applied for, and a couple of days after he escapes from the colony, and no effort is made to follow him.

This gross injustice has been going on for years, ever since the cession of this place to the Crown, and, in consequence, the place does not receive that development which it is capable of. No doubt this wrong could not have gone on for so many years, were the merchants and the inhabitants generally not politically dead or corrupted by obtaining bribes in the shape of contracts which have not been submitted to public tender.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others.

But there was an equally important assumption which seems to have been confused by some colonial administrators and other apologists of colonialism and this is the fact that the British, like other colonizers, went out to the colonies primarily, if not exclusively, to enrich themselves and promote their own interests. The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations. And since such relations are predominantly economic, colonial practice was conditioned by economic laws. 1"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony and Natal before 1870', 'content': ""Two issues dominated the Cape parliament, the demand for the partition of the Colony and the conflicts between the executive and the legislative authorities.

For the constitution to work, it depended on the personality of the particular governor and the economic situation of the colony.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose. Examples of these two developments are found among the Igbo of Nigeria, the Gikuyu of Kenya and the Langi of northern Uganda. ! 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.588, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity.

Both sayings imply that nobody should be concerned with what happens to government property. This mentality was the direct product of the remote and esoteric nature of the colonial administration and the elimination of an overwhelming majority of Africans, both educated and uneducated, from the decision-making process. It is important to note that this mentality is still with most Africans even after decades of independence and is part of the explanation for the reckless way in which government property is handled in many independent African countries."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The Young Associations', 'content': ""Something of their attitudes may be garnished from the list of grievances the KCA leadership presented to the governor when the latter visited Muranga in 1925.

The petition also dealt with the local problems that the colonial administration created for the people, such as the compulsory rebuilding of sanitary huts to prevent plague and the banning of the growing of cotton and coffee by Africans. Finally, it put forward programmes for improvement, asking the administration to expand the training facilities for hospital orderlies, for the building of a high school, and for the setting up of a school for girls. These requests made little impression on the colonial authorities.\nBut official scorn did not deter these leaders.

Wolseley was instructed to gain control of African affairs for the Crown and to delay responsible government for the whites in preparation for a South African federation.$^{34}$ Since peaceful approaches would be pursued, Carnarvon became conciliatory to the Boers by dangling a settlement of the diamond fields disputes. In 1875 he proposed a conference of the colonies and republics where minor issues such as a common African policy and territorial misunderstandings would be discussed as a prelude to the main issue of confederation.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 269, 'article_title': 'LAGOS GOVERNMENT AND THE PROTECTORATE OF OKEADON AND ADDO', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS GOVERNMENT AND THE PROTECTORATE OF OKEADON AND ADDO', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-6', 'issue_date': '23_12_1863', 'content': 'We have received (_vide_ Notice), too late for publication this month, an able and interesting elucidation of the policy of the Lagos Government, in assuming the above-mentioned protectorates.

We cannot allow these assertions to pass uncontradicted; otherwise the authorities in Downing-street and the English people would think that they are true, as silence in such a crisis would seem to show consent. Captain Glover has been used to scribble laudable reports of his own acts, and draw excellent maps of Lagos and the interior, including the so-called new road (where Mr. Goldsworthy was nearly killed by the Igbo-benim bush people, and whence several of the carriers had to run away back to Lagos), to suit his own purpose of warfare and the destruction of nations, and not for lawful trade, as proved by the intercepted letters at Abeokuta from the chief Kakaranfo, of Ibadan, to Captain Glover and his counsellors, Isaac (the ex-head Olokps of Lagos), Lemoron, Magaji, Shitta, Abamba, Abay-ade, and the Mahomedan young men, for the destruction of Abeokuta and Ijebu), which were published in the _African Times_ of June 24th, 1872. Now, Mr. Editor, mark what followed. The principal chief of Ibadan at the time disapproved of this wicked plot, and refused to carry out these evil designs. This chief\'s name is ""Ajobo."" The ""Gloverite"" Ibadans conspired to assassinate him. Getting a hint of it, he fled to the kingdom of Jebu, and is still living at Ipara under the protection of the King of Jebu.

Captain Glover has been fooling the Colonial-office, in Downing-street, with all sorts of reports, to make sure of his promotion, as he said and believes the more people talk against him the better he will be esteemed by the Secretary of State and other superior authorities. Captain Glover is so mean in his dealings with the lowest class of natives as to make them believe that he has only to deal with the Queen, and that no other power can question what he is doing. He sets nation against nation, country against country—divides friends against one another, and, to crown all, he holds the destiny of Lagos and the interior in his hands. Acting on the powers reserved to him in the prohibition of export of arms and ordnance, he sent lots of ammunition to all the ex-chiefs and princes of Porto Novo, to fight against their lawful King, and to cause civil war there; he dealt out guns, powder, shot, swords, knives, and other implements of war, to all the surrounding tribes, Western and Northern, to fight against the Egbas; and the natives in the Eastern part to fight against the Jebus at Ikno-du; and last, not least, he shipped ammunition by night to the Ibadan by a round-about route. We say, Mr. Editor, all this is done at the expense of the settlement, contrary to the true interests of the settlement; and can it be strange that we are all in danger of being ruined? The consequence is that all the surrounding countries refuse to treat with him, because of his deceitful and treacherous acts; and the Egbas have closed their road for as long as Glover is in Lagos. Captain Glover now said he had opened a new road in the Eastern district to go to Ibadan. He invited the merchants; we went, and saw nothing. We reported this to him; he got annoyed, and determined to open a bush road, by force of arms, to get fame! He is trying to be Governor-in-Chief. He wants to be knighted, and to be Sir John Glover. Alas! false reports to the Colonial-office will no doubt get this for him. We believe in it. Again, when the Government seized some cases of gin from the French vessel Co-operation in 1867, the Secretary of State ordered the seizure money to be returned to Regis Ainè, at Lagos. The amounts were paid thus: the Collector refunded his share, and the Treasury refunded that of the Colony; Captain Glover, as Administrator, never refunded his share of 340l.; he made the Colony pay it; and in the name of honesty we solemnly protest against this. Captain Glover has not paid or refunded that 340l. from 1867 to this month of April, 1872. Alas! Captain Glover, if no human being is capable of checking you, have you forgotten that the Creator sees you, and you shall have to give an account? We tax-payers cannot afford to allow the Colony to pay this 340l. for you, and the Secretary of State ought to order you to pay it immediately. We say, moreover, that you ought to refund all the expenses you incur in supplying unnecessary ammunitions, &c., to the natives to excite them to rebel against their countrymen and sovereign. We tell you in plain terms your policy tends to our ruin. You may fool the authorities, and know how to play the game to get promotion, as you say, but we say it is not right. It is said that when any public officers are abused, then the Colonial-office is sure to promote them; and so you are certain you will be promoted.

Some time in September 1871, this Nebuchadnezzar took it into his head to do wonders, and among other things to aggrandize these Settlements by requiring the country of Porto Novo to be annexed to Lagos. In order to realize this object, his Attorney-General prepared a petition to suit the purpose in view, accusing the King of Porto Novo, &c., and praying that his Excellency would take (of course by force, willing or not willing,) the country, because the King is unable to manage his country, and because the King himself is unmanageable. This petition was sent round to the natives of Lagos, with private commands, threatenings, and promises, that they must sign the petition. They obey, against their conscience; and a whole lot of (his) marks were put in to names of all sorts of characters.* Badagry and the districts of Porto Novo, &c., were next operated on by threats and promises, and all sorts of names were put down—viz., of the Bush people, and ex-chiefs living in the farms and villages. Poor people! they are told one thing, and behold another is meant by the document. After the petitions thus signed were sent on to the Administrator, he commenced expeditions up and down Badagry, getting all sorts of false news against the King of Porto Novo. The complaints thus said to have been made to the Administrator he caused to be printed and posted up in Lagos, as also notice that he will take charge of Porto Novo waters. His Excellency then sent up the steamer Eyo with Mr. Magistrate Goldsworthy on board, who, acting as commodore and senior officer, took charge, and hoisted his pendant on board. The steamer left Lagos on the 7th December filled with houssas, or raw Mahommedan levies. Since then she has remained off Porto Novo, cruising about there, and striking terror into the poor natives who have not forgotten the destruction and bloodshed caused by Consul Forte and Commodore Edmonstone. The petition to annex Porto Novo is not, Mr. Editor, a voluntary act, but a direct Executive command, in order to get fame. Our Administrator is getting too big in Lagos; in fact he wanted all countries to come down and worship him and kiss his foot. The people are not such fools now as they were aforetime; owing to his policy of unnecessary intervention he caused our neighbourhood to distrust all peaceful traders and missionaries. He ignores the interests of the merchants, through whose operations the revenue of the settlement is obtained. It is always easy for him to say, ""Who are they? they are nobody."" But, thank Heaven, the African Times is in existence, and we shall thus be able to expose all pernicious doings. Does England annex Greece because the Greek brigands massacred the English travellers last year? Does any country or nation attempt to annex England or Paris, &c., because burglary is committed in the house of one of its subjects in London, &c.? We say, for shame, Capt. Glover! Why should there be this constant bullying the poor Africans, and striking terror into them? Is this the policy of England? If any king does wrong he ought to be told of it, and asked to repair the damage, and by fair representation he will do it; otherwise public opinion would soon be brought to bear upon him.

It is, perhaps, ungrateful in us to write thus of one who has lately paid us a very high compliment. We felt it to be our duty, during the month of December last, to bring Captain Glover and the course he was then pursuing at Lagos, to the great disturbance of the public mind, under the special notice of Earl Kimberley. The correspondence appears in our January number. In reply to our representation relative to the ""prohibition of the export of arms ordinance,"" his lordship informed us that the said ordinance was passed by the Lagos Council in pursuance of his lordship\'s instructions. Copies of these letters, it would seem, were sent off to Lagos by the Colonial-office, and Captain Glover did us the honour to print them and placard them in Lagos (at the public expense, of course), and even to send copies of them to some of our best known friends, thus anticipating the publication of them in the African Times (cide letter, p. 119). It would have been difficult for the Administrator of Lagos to have given a more convincing proof of the importance, in his estimation, of our intervention in Lagos affairs. We for a long time abstained from any such intervention, except to praise Captain Glover for certain sanitary and other measures calculated to improve Lagos. We knew but too well, from occasional indications, that the old disease was still in the Administrator\'s mind, and that the long enjoyment of uncontrolled power in Lagos was making him imperious and arbitrary. It was only, however, when the said disease came once more to a head, and even some of his most devoted admirers were filled with alarm and apprehension, that we felt it to be an imperative duty on our part to interfere; and that interference, we believe, will not be without fruit—aye, and good fruit too. Captain Glover\'s policy, or rather impolicy, dangerous and full of the elements of destruction, will not bear the official and public scrutiny to which we are subjecting it. The strong light of truth which we direct upon it will show it in all its criminal error; for such administrative errors are criminal. There cannot be any such secrecy in the political relations of Lagos with the adjoining countries—a commercial emporium, with its sale and supply markets—that a grave complication, justifying such measures as we have referred to the consideration of Earl Kimberley should exist without the merchants and traders of Lagos knowing all about it. So far as our information extends—and its sources are many and reliable—no merchant or trader at Lagos whose opinion is worth a moment\'s regard, can find any complication to justify them. If it exists, therefore, it must be that it is the creation of the Governor\'s own mind, or has been created expressly for his mind by the wretched flatterers who surround him, and have fastened themselves by his favour, like birds of prey, upon the revenues of Lagos. The propaganda of trade and civilization from Lagos must be an entirely pacific and conciliatory one, if it is to have any success; and such distribution in hot haste of 1,000 muskets, as is described in the letter above referred to, is neither pacific nor conciliatory; but, on the contrary, an insane, wasteful, and dangerous expenditure of Colonial revenue, that cannot be too strongly condemned. As we know, however, that our counsel has weight with the Egbas, we venture to express the hope that they will shame the intemperate folly of the Administrator of Lagos, by their wisdom and patience. They have only to wait a short time; and, in the natural course of events, a beneficial change will assuredly come—a change that will establish the peaceful relations of Lagos with all the interior countries, and, above all, with Abeokuta, upon a firm and sure foundation.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Culpable Mismanagement at the Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Other departments are also corrupt; but it is useless complaining to the Governor.

Some years ago we do not hesitate to confess that we doubted the wisdom of the Colonial-office regulation limiting the number of years during which a governor or administrator could be allowed to remain in charge of any one particular colony or settlement. Our reason might be found in our disbelief that every man whom it might please the Colonial-office, for any one of the many considerations which influence there, to select for these offices must necessarily be a heaven-born ruler. We thought, therefore, that after a few years experience a man would be better qualified to rule the colony or settlement placed under his charge than he was at the offset. And so he doubtless would be, were not the value of that increased knowledge outweighed by the evils too frequently gaining strength while it is being obtained. Pride and vanity are not unfrequently more opposed than even inexperience to beneficial rule. Captain Glover has shown us that the regulation of the Colonial-office above alluded to is a sound one, by the evils that have attended the setting it aside in his case. He has not gained wisdom by experience; his pride and vanity, which never registered very low in the barometrical tube of human character and passions, have dangerously increased, and prevented him from profiting by the lessons of the past. He seems to think that Lagos was created for him, instead of his being merely nominated to a temporary connexion with it. In no other way can we account for his present conduct. He set out with a desire to annex Porto Novo, to humble Abeokuta, and establish a claim to as much territory as possible on the mainland in the direction of that town. Although the British Government disapproved the intended annexation of Porto Novo, we have seen that of late he has allowed an address to be promoted by his creatures, and signed and presented to him at Lagos, asking him to annex that place; and he has made threatening demonstrations, by his armed steamer, his Houssa troops, and the firing of guns and rockets, against that place. Although his open antagonism with Abeokuta produced so much commercial ruin at Lagos in 1865-7, and without doubt had achieved no good whatever, we have seen him at a later time in the affair ""Tuvi"" venturing in the same direction; subjecting thereby many of the merchants and traders in Lagos to great loss and inconvenience, without any beneficial public object to be thereby attained. And now, again, in the most unjustifiable, because unnecessary, ""prohibition of export of arms ordinance,"" by irritating and insulting messages to the authorities of Abeokuta; and by permitting that same ill-omened ""Tuvi"" to recommence his manœuvres for creating troubles with the Egbas at Iseri, he has proved his unfitness for the post he occupies, because he prefers to listen to the pernicious dictates of his vanity, pride, and hatred, instead of to the voice of the important commercial interests of Lagos. The greatest and most valuable commercial relations of Lagos are with the Egbas, whose chief town is Lagos, and with Port Novo and its neighbourhood; yet has he persistently surrounded himself with the bitterest enemies of the Egbas. It has always been a saying in Lagos that a sure path to his favour and patronage is to show hatred to the Egbas; so fond is he of seeing his own passion and prejudice reflected in those around him.

But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him.

Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon.

In contrast, The African Times provides a more detailed account of Glover's governance, highlighting his popularity and positive impact in Lagos through local improvements and fair treatment of both Europeans and Africans, which supports the claim of effective local governance. However, the articles also critique his external policies, particularly his antagonistic stance towards neighboring states like Abeokuta, which led to commercial disruptions and strained relations, thereby challenging the claim by illustrating how his policies could exacerbate negative impacts of colonial administration. Despite strong local and European support for Glover's return, indicating confidence in his ability to manage local affairs, the articles acknowledge the limitations and failures of broader colonial governance structures. Together, these sources present a complex picture that both supports and contradicts the claim, highlighting the dual nature of Glover's administration and the broader colonial context.","The General History of Africa textbook does not specifically mention Governor Glover or his policies, which is a notable difference from the claim.

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

MacCarthy improved the early villages and built new ones, where new arrivals were adopted and settled down among brothers. Vague European notions of model communities contrasted with African values, ways of life and traditional activities. Land and property in the town appreciated in value, and craft industries and trade opened the way to personal prosperity. Around 1828 enterprising individuals secured the entrØe to the coast's new type of economy. In 1831 the colony was opened to foreign trade. The standard of British governors and the level of British subsidies fell. The Sierra Leoneans were to take charge of their own affairs, subject to remaining within the colonial frame› work. Throughout this teething period Western influence, including that of the missionaries, was crucial.\nThe British upper and ruling classes financed the churches and the smaller denominations, whose personnel had had no training whatsoever in anti-slavery or missionary work. Sierra Leone became their training ground. In addition to spreading Christianity and civilization the missions had to fight the slave trade, especially at Rio Pongos. But local slave-traders suspected these people of spying for the colonial government: they set fire to buildings of the Church Missionary Society who abandoned the field. In the colony itself, where political authority was conscious of its humanitarian mission, the missionaries were not unconscious of politics. MacCarthy put them in charge of the villages of freed slaves. In the civil administration, despite acute personal and doctrinal rivalries, the co-operation of powerful personalities with the government achieved sound long-term results. Schools were opened, and scores of different ethnic groups rubbed shoul› ders in them, through the intermediary of English, from which a national language developed. Though religious syncretism was not achieved, at any rate Christianity, traditional African religions and Islam co-existed at close quarters."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910.

Only in Morocco did the French seriously consider it, and there primarily because of the attention given to indigenous affairs by the ResidentGeneral, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who, in the initial years of the protec› torate, ruled with few restrictions from the metropolitan government. Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard.

A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

There, land was owned and controlled by the rist system, that is, mostly by individual lineages; it was practically inalienable and was therefore unavailable for distribution by the emperor or governor for patronage purposes. The obligations were heavy in the regions in the south and west conquered by Menelik, where the lords and naftanyas (literally 'gunbearers': settlers from the Abyssinian highlands) greatly exploited the people partly through gult rights and obligations. 1 5 The provincial governors performed functions similar to those of the lords but on a larger scale.

Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements.

Whatever might be said of Governor Glover's policy as to the Egbas and Yorubas, certain it is that it will be, I fear, some time before we get his like at any rate in Lagos. One that showed so little prejudice as to colour, that showed and acted with true English spirit, always for fair play, and leaning and taking the part of the ignorant and weak. One that will take so much interest in, or work so hard personally to improve, not only the place, but society, as did Governor Glover; nor yet will we, I fear, easily get an administrator out on this coast who will so well understand how to deal with, or take such patience and trouble to benefit us Africans generally as he did. He did not sit at Government House merely to receive reports and give orders, but he would see into things himself, see orders carried out; and in many instances would work harder than those under him, taking a shovel, or pulling on a rope with the workmen. *Par parenthesis*, we must admit there is one gentleman of Governor Glover's type in the person of His Excellency Governor Rowe, Governor-in-Chief of Sierra Leone; and we like him very well, too, only he is rather too fond of using his fists, boots, and horse-whip in a very undignified manner, and enforcing work on Sundays."", 'last_edit_date': '1877-09-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1877#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Policy on the Sierra Leone Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As most of our readers are aware, there has been formed in Sierra Leone an association to promote the development of the country, which includes natives of all ranks, with resident Europeans.

This association has also suggested the appointment of native agents in all the treaty districts, whose business it should be to keep the Governor informed of all native movements tending towards war. This would enable him to take effectual action for their suppression, and he should be authorised to use the powers lodged in him for that purpose. Were a plan like this carried out, and not left to the variable notions of successive Governors, many a smouldering fire would be extinguished before it burst into the flames of war.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

They were kindly asked for by Mr. W. M'Arthur, M.P., on the 20th February last (as recorded in our paper), and granted immediately by Mr. Hugusson. These returns reach us at too late a date to permit of full remarks upon them. We are very glad, however, that we sought for and obtained them, as, although they are not all we could desire, they do give much valuable information—valuable, because dependable as far as it goes. We hope to get the returns to end of 1871 during the present Session. Increasing in importance and revenue as some of the British West Coast Settlements now are, and governed, as all of them are, without any real participation of any portion of the people in legislative matters, it is most necessary we should have these accounts every year; and we have no doubt that in course of time we shall get more explanatory details than are at present given. In another part of this paper we publish the annual Revenue and Expenditure of each of the settlements from 1866 to 1870 inclusive, and have appended observations of our own, showing some important particulars necessary to be borne in mind for arriving at the amount of real ordinary revenue. These returns show how rapidly the two more southern settlements—the Gold Coast and Lagos—are advancing, in comparison with Sierra Leone. Our impression is that with the One Shilling Spirit Duty, now that our revenue system extends over the old Dutch possessions, the Gold Coast revenue, for the present year, will quite reach 45,000l., and for 1873 be at least 60,000l. Lagos has nearly doubled since 1866, and is now above 40,000l., while very little perceptible increase has taken place at Sierra Leone, notwithstanding the increase of trade at the Sherbro. We purpose returning to this subject next month. Meanwhile, however, we cannot avoid giving praise where praise is due. It has been, and is, our duty to denounce, in the strongest terms, the erroneous and wicked policy pursued by the Governor of Lagos in his relations with the neighbouring native States. It is impossible to use words of condemnation too strong for such policy on the part of a Governor of a purely mercantile and trading colony, totally depending on those neighbouring States for an outlet for its imports, and for produce to make returns to Europe—in a word, for its whole trade. But we feel it to be our duty, at the same time, to renew our praises of Administrator Glover in other particulars. He is not un roi fainéant, but an active, energetic man—a man who could have got rid of the pestiferous filth of Cape Coast, Accra, and other Gold Coast towns in a very short time, had he been at Cape Coast instead of at Lagos. The returns laid before Parliament give evidence of this commendable activity of Administrator Glover. They show the carrying on of purification and improvements in all directions. No wonder that Lagos has become, under his auspices, a really healthy settlement for Europeans, as well as for natives. But this only makes it the more to be deplored that he should be at the same time sapping the very commercial life of the place by a crooked and evil exterior policy—a policy which, from our point of view, makes it indispensable that he should be removed to some other sphere of operations, because he has so identified himself with it that none of the neighbouring people can, or will, ever feel any confidence in him. And they are right; for he is a man incapable of change, and having once taken a fatal bias, it would be impossible ever to get him to go straight forward in a right direction."", 'last_edit_date': '1872-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1872#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Good Relations with Ashantee: How to Restore and Maintain them', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following suggestions on this important subject have been made by one long resident on the Gold Coast.

But it would be necessary that the King should also be induced to send us a consul or agent, who ought to be well treated, and made acquainted with the refinements of European life. He should not be an ordinary chief or captain, but one of Ashantee\'s nobles, because there are many there. With this guarantee here, our Administrator could with every safety visit Ashantee, and display, in a dignified and graceful manner, the refined customs of Europe.

The colony he was going to govern was the oldest British Colony on the West Coast of Africa, but it had not made that progress which it should have made considering the time they had had it. It was now about 300 years since the first occupation of the Gold Coast took place, but the Government had neglected the opportunities afforded for its advancement and development. However, largely on account of the action of the merchants in Liverpool and Manchester, and of England generally, a great deal more had been done in the last ten years to call attention to the importance of these colonies. They were now making better progress than ever before, and they relied upon his Excellency to see that this greater progress was continued. In the Colony he was going to administer there had been an excess of taxation over expenditure by some £200,000, which was lying in London unused. They urged that it was the duty of the Government to use it productively. Any excess in receipts should be used to make taxation more equal. He hoped that the new Governor would give his attention to this matter on his arrival on the coast. Another matter was the supply of water to the coast towns; and then there was the question of the railways. For years they had urged upon the Government the necessity for the construction of railways to the hinterland of the Gold Coast. They did not want to hurry the Government on this question, but if there was any progress to be made in this direction it was necessary something should be done to put them on an equality with other countries. It had been said that the first thing was to construct a harbour, for it would be impossible for the Government to land the material necessary for the construction of a railway unless there was a harbour where the goods could be landed. Latterly they had before them the proposed ordinance dealing with Crown concessions of land for mining or other purposes. He thought it was the first duty of the Government to see that such grants were utilised. The Section had sometimes complained or criticised some action, and he begged the Governor to believe any criticism of theirs upon any Governor or Government on the coast was done with the desire to co-operate with that Government or Governor to advance the welfare of the country in which they had all such interest. It was a great position his Excellency was going to fill. Governor Maxwell would have 2,000,000 human beings to care for, and he had the power to make or mar their happiness. It was a position of great responsibility, and it was one, in nine cases out of ten, filled with dignity and honour, and with a full regard for the welfare and the rights of the native population. At present Governor Maxwell was before them as an untried man as far as the West Coast was concerned, but his previous experiences would be of the greatest use to him amongst the natives of the West Coast. He might depend upon their support in everything calculated to advance the interests of the country which he was going to administer. He could only hope that Governor Maxwell would have good health to carry on the government successfully. They had every good wish for his future success.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-03-15', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN GLOVER v.

Some years ago we do not hesitate to confess that we doubted the wisdom of the Colonial-office regulation limiting the number of years during which a governor or administrator could be allowed to remain in charge of any one particular colony or settlement. Our reason might be found in our disbelief that every man whom it might please the Colonial-office, for any one of the many considerations which influence there, to select for these offices must necessarily be a heaven-born ruler. We thought, therefore, that after a few years experience a man would be better qualified to rule the colony or settlement placed under his charge than he was at the offset. And so he doubtless would be, were not the value of that increased knowledge outweighed by the evils too frequently gaining strength while it is being obtained. Pride and vanity are not unfrequently more opposed than even inexperience to beneficial rule. Captain Glover has shown us that the regulation of the Colonial-office above alluded to is a sound one, by the evils that have attended the setting it aside in his case. He has not gained wisdom by experience; his pride and vanity, which never registered very low in the barometrical tube of human character and passions, have dangerously increased, and prevented him from profiting by the lessons of the past. He seems to think that Lagos was created for him, instead of his being merely nominated to a temporary connexion with it. In no other way can we account for his present conduct. He set out with a desire to annex Porto Novo, to humble Abeokuta, and establish a claim to as much territory as possible on the mainland in the direction of that town. Although the British Government disapproved the intended annexation of Porto Novo, we have seen that of late he has allowed an address to be promoted by his creatures, and signed and presented to him at Lagos, asking him to annex that place; and he has made threatening demonstrations, by his armed steamer, his Houssa troops, and the firing of guns and rockets, against that place. Although his open antagonism with Abeokuta produced so much commercial ruin at Lagos in 1865-7, and without doubt had achieved no good whatever, we have seen him at a later time in the affair ""Tuvi"" venturing in the same direction; subjecting thereby many of the merchants and traders in Lagos to great loss and inconvenience, without any beneficial public object to be thereby attained. And now, again, in the most unjustifiable, because unnecessary, ""prohibition of export of arms ordinance,"" by irritating and insulting messages to the authorities of Abeokuta; and by permitting that same ill-omened ""Tuvi"" to recommence his manœuvres for creating troubles with the Egbas at Iseri, he has proved his unfitness for the post he occupies, because he prefers to listen to the pernicious dictates of his vanity, pride, and hatred, instead of to the voice of the important commercial interests of Lagos. The greatest and most valuable commercial relations of Lagos are with the Egbas, whose chief town is Lagos, and with Port Novo and its neighbourhood; yet has he persistently surrounded himself with the bitterest enemies of the Egbas. It has always been a saying in Lagos that a sure path to his favour and patronage is to show hatred to the Egbas; so fond is he of seeing his own passion and prejudice reflected in those around him. This is again becoming a very serious matter. The yearly commerce of Lagos with Europe, and principally with England, counts by hundreds of thousands of pounds; and with all due respect to Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for\n[APRIL 23, 1872.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Governor Maxwell said he considered it a great advantage to meet those who could assist him in dealing with difficult questions, and to acquire some touch with the great centre of commerce with which the distant part of the globe he was to govern traded directly.

In a Dutch Colony in Sumatra he had seen an artesian well sunk in a mangrove swamp near the sea shore which turned an unhealthy district into a place fit for the habitation of Europeans. As far as the railway was concerned the delay might have been caused through the proposition of rival routes. If a railway was feasible, it would not be his fault if it was not very soon in hand. With regard to what the chairman had said about complaints, he would always be glad to receive any suggestions, but he must ask them to bear in mind that their object should be to get at the truth. He would welcome any criticism that had this object in view. The land ordinance was a subject he could not pretend he had mastered, and he could make no specific statement regarding it. It, however, seemed curious that such an ordinance should be required, and he thought something should have been done long ago. It would be a mistake to grant tracts of land to speculators who had no intention of using them, or who were unable to do so. In the colonisation of Australia the Government there laid it down that concessions to settlers by Natives would not be sanctioned by the Government. The circumstances might be different in Africa, where there were princes with a recognised jurisdiction, but it would have been better if it was understood that concessions other than those granted by the Government would not be recognised. With regard to the mining industry he would make it one of his first duties to see how far the Government could go to aid in the development of these resources. But he had seen mines that were very promising, but which turned out to be very unproductive, and it would be necessary to see that these mines were not of this nature before it would be wise to construct a railway at considerable expense to the district in which they were situated. As to the rivalry of other countries, he thought they were agreed that if other countries allowed free trade it did not matter what the port was, but other countries did not grant free trade. Still, other countries had their aspirations, and they had a right to colonise on their own account and develop their own trade. But there were such things as hostile protective tariffs, and his efforts would be directed towards the means of attracting as much trade as possible by developing the roads, &c. With regard to Ashanti, he did not yet know how far it was possible to carry out the establishment of a British Protectorate there, but he was sure that if the Natives knew the advantages they would welcome the change. However, until he arrived at the Gold Coast and discussed these matters on the spot he was unable to say anything positive. He would do his best to make the district a prosperous one. He must be understood as speaking with the fullest reserve in this ignorance of the state of affairs in the Colony, and it would be imprudent at that juncture to discount', 'last_edit_date': '1895-03-15', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE GOLD COAST AT LIVERPOOL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'what might be done next year.

Whatever may be our rivalries, no matter how widely different may be the aspirations, the interests, or even the languages of the competitors, one and all acknowledge the same supreme Ruler. Even with this limitation, there will be more than enough to fill every inch of space at the disposal of the Commissioners.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The textbook highlights the adaptability of colonial administrators, such as Lugard's development of indirect rule in Northern Nigeria, which integrated existing African authorities into the colonial system, demonstrating a level of administrative resilience and leadership. However, it also points out the limitations, such as the lack of uniformity in colonial policies and the cultural imposition that often accompanied colonial rule, with the French noted for their direct use of indigenous authorities. Health challenges, including high mortality rates from tropical diseases, were significant obstacles, with colonial administrations often reacting rather than proactively addressing these issues. The African Times articles add depth by highlighting effective leadership in specific instances, such as Captain John Hawley Glover's sanitary reforms in Lagos, which made it more habitable and set a positive example. Yet, they also criticize the overarching governance structure, particularly the governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa, as inefficient and lacking understanding of local customs.

Overall, the textbook suggests that while there was some degree of administrative resilience and leadership, it was not uniformly effective across all colonial territories, and the cultural and health challenges were significant obstacles that were not always successfully navigated.","The African Times news articles provide a nuanced view of the administrative resilience and leadership among European colonial governors in West Africa, which both supports and refutes the claim. On one hand, the articles highlight the effective leadership of individuals like Captain John Hawley Glover, who is praised for his sanitary reforms in Lagos, making it more habitable and setting an example for other regions. This supports the claim by illustrating how some governors successfully navigated health challenges and influenced governance positively. On the other hand, the articles also criticize the overarching governance structure, particularly the governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa, as a failure that led to inefficiencies and a lack of understanding of local customs. This criticism refutes the claim by suggesting that the administrative system often hindered effective governance and policy-making. Additionally, the articles discuss the inadequate salaries and challenging conditions faced by governors, which could compromise their effectiveness, further complicating the narrative of resilience and effective leadership.

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

At the pinnacle of the administrative system stood the governor or residentgeneral who, while ultimately responsible to his national government, frequently enjoyed the powers of a sovereign.\nThe institutional framework within which he acted varied considerably in size and complexity, but he was usually assisted in the inter-war period by some form of consultative council or commercial interests. The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A basis for the future', 'content': ""Finally, it is pertinent to ask whether these massive changes were largely or even entirely the result of the colonial penetration. Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910.

Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard.

A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

We could not marvel, because, as described to us, it is a place under the tropics—a mere sandbank in the lagoon, opposite the River Ogun, rising very little above the water's edge—was overgrown in the unpeopled part with a rank vegetation, luxuriating and decaying in something very like a morass; and the inhabited portion was reeking with filthy and pestilential odours. And now, mark well, in this place, which had with justice obtained so deadly a reputation, only one European died during the last twelve months, out of about a hundred, while native deaths were also wonderfully diminished in number. This statement was made in a letter which we published last month, and which came to us from a source which justifies us in believing its statements. And to what is this happy change owing? Has Lagos turned out of the tropics, or been elevated by some natural convulsion so as to bring her into a more vigorous atmosphere; or has decaying vegetation ceased to produce pestilential miasma owing to some secative change, and from the same cause other filth become inoffensive? Nothing of the sort, of course. Lagos has had the good fortune to be under the administration of a man who did not like to see his fellow-creatures and countrymen die around him like rotten sheep—a man with energy of character, who was convinced that Lagos could be made habitable, and who steadily and persistently set about making her so. We have differed with Administrator Glover's policy on many occasions as regards the main land, with its energetic, cultivating, and trading people, and had occasionally to find fault with him in other respects, but we have never failed to give him a high meed of praise for his administrative abilities. He has not been a Roi fainéant, like most of the West African administrators, indifferent to the moral and social progress, the material improvement and commercial development of the settlement under his charge; but has honestly and patiently laboured to bring about changes, which, in some instances, grievously offended the native prejudices, but which were indispensable to the obtaining results such as we have been commenting upon. With the exception of Bathurst, Lagos was naturally one of the most unfavourable of spots for successful results to sanitary reforms, and yet see what has been accomplished. We are ashamed for British rule when we hear of continued insalubrity at Cape Coast, Accra, and other places under British authority on the Coast of Guinea. When shall we have administrators there who will form a proper estimate of the value of human life, and seek to preserve it by removing the causes of disease which prove so often fatal to it? Captain John Hawley Glover, R.N., Administrator of Lagos, has been really the first West African sanitary reformer with sound and comprehensive views, and knows how to act with conciliation as well as with persistent energy and firmness. All honour to him. He has made Lagos habitable, and now he is lighting, as well as striving to enlighten her. Street lamps in Lagos! Look at that, ye old slave-traders, who may still be brooding over past atrocities of your unholy traffic. Lamps in Lagos! We anticipate great results on the interior from Lagos example. This has been our cry from the very day that Lagos was annexed and became a British settlement. We said it was her mission to bring a reflection of European and Christian civilisation home to the very borders of the Egba and Yoruba countries. Civilisation is catching; and we now look forward with even more than former confidence to great and widespread results in those countries, which will undoubtedly become the richest, as they are by far the most enterprising, portion of native West Africa.""}, {'id': 1782, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1870#article-2', 'issue_date': '23_04_1870', 'content': 'His Excellency Sir Arthur E.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage. The present system is a great injustice to Sierra Leone, and it is high time that it should be remedied.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all more or less acquainted with the phrase, ""grandmotherly government,"" and know how much annoyance is caused—and that, too, with but little corresponding advantage—when the Legislature takes upon itself to decide upon minor questions of purely social interest, the solution of which is best left to the individual; but the complaint of the inhabitants of the West African Settlements is not that now and then the Legislature meddles with matters best left to individual judgment, but that the people are altogether suffering from ""over-government."" In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Irving, K.C.M.G., at Willis's Rooms, by gentlemen connected with the West Indies, on the occasion of his proceeding to British Guiana as Governor, after having served in that capacity in Trinidad. The Earl of Kimberley presided. In reply to the toast of his health, which was proposed by Mr. Crum Ewing, the Earl of Kimberley remarked that it had been truly said by some of the speakers that evening that perhaps one of the most responsible duties that fell upon a Colonial Secretary was the choice of a Governor whom he could recommend to her Majesty; and from the manner in which they had received Sir Henry Irving that evening, he might fairly say that they had ratified the choice which he (Lord Kimberley) had made. (Cheers.) The choice had been made because Sir Henry Irving had been thoroughly tried, especially in West Indian affairs, and because he was an able and efficient administrator. Therefore he thought he might with confidence augur for him a continuation of his distinguished and successful career in British Guiana. A Colonial Secretary could only have but a general view of the monotonous affairs of colonial matters brought before him obtained by means of that information brought to him by individuals and by despatches; but he had always thought that the West Indies deserved the greatest consideration from the Government of this country. But they had passed through great and severe trials. They had to hear the brunt of a great and philanthropic measure—one which did the utmost credit to this country, but which fell heavily, and necessarily heavily, upon the West Indian proprietor. It was said in some at least of the colonies that they had surmounted those difficulties, and all credit was due to them for having done so, and perhaps the main cause for their success had been the system of immigration labour. He quite agreed with those gentlemen who had spoken of the importance of encouraging that immigration, and of making it an institution and benefit, not only to the proprietors who engaged them, but to the Coolies themselves, who, he believed, enjoyed great prosperity in those colonies. There was one remarkable change which he looked upon as certain, and that was the construction of the Panama Canal, and when that highway was made the whole position of the West Indian Colonies would be changed. They would then be directly on one of the most important highways of the world, and he felt certain that the West Indian Colonies had a very remarkable future before them, and it would be impossible for either himself or any one else to guess what would be the results of the change. If, however, they took the map, no one would fail to see that there must be for those colonies a great future prosperity, and he recommended the subject to all those interested in the colonies. (Cheers.) The result of the project might be distant, but he thought they should all hold out in the belief that the time was coming when their property would be far more valuable since the time of the slave emancipation. The world moved so fast that even distant speculations were not always out of place. The present condition of British Guiana was on the whole satisfactory. Its prosperity would, he trusted, continue. Its administration would be conducted by a very able and efficient Governor. It had among its inhabitants as enterprising men as in any of our other colonies. It would have all the attention that he could give it, and all the attention of the efficient staff of the Colonial Office, and he trusted that its prosperity might long be assured and continue to increase.

The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko. The situation was so serious that troops had to be brought in from the Gold Coast. In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""With the establishment of European administration, chiefs were manipulated as if they were administrative personnel who might be reposted or removed to satisfy colonial needs. Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system.

In Uganda, by 1920, there were 328 elementary schools in Buganda and only 34, 24 and practically none in the Western, Eastern and Northern provinces respectively.$^{37}$ Facilities for education were so inadequate and so unevenly distributed, because the colonial powers did not aim at pro› moting education for its own sake or for the sake of the Africans, but rather, to quote one African scholar, 'to produce Africans who would be more productive for the [colonial] system'. 38 Besides its grossly inadequate nature numerically and its uneven dis› tribution, the curricula provided by all these institutions were determined by the colonial rulers and were closely modelled on, if not carbon copies of, those of the metropolitan countries and therefore irrelevant to the needs of the continent. No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Inter-territorial movements and international movements: the National Congress of British West Africa', 'content': ""They condemned the right assumed by the European powers of exchanging or partitioning countries between them without reference to, or regard for, the wishes of the people, which they declared to be tanta› mount to a species of slavery.

Finally, the Conference resolved itself into a National Congress of British West Africa, and determined to represent its views to London.\nA delegation in which The Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Nigeria were represented, went to London in 1920 to petition His Majesty's Government to grant elective representation to the four colonies (see Plate 25.2).

As Angoulvant, who was appointed Governor of the Ivory Coast in August 1908, put it: What has to be established above all is the indisputable principle of our authority ... On the part of the natives, the acceptance of this principle must be expressed in a deferential welcome and absolute respect for our representatives whoever they may be, in the full payment of taxes at a uniform rate of 2.50 francs, in serious co› operation in the construction of tracks and roads, in the acceptance of paid porterage, in the following of our advice [sic] in regard to labour, in recourse to our justice ... Signs of impatience or disrespect towards our authority, and the deliberate lack of goodwill are to be repressed without delay. 55 In all the newly acquired colonies, the objectives outlined here were pur› sued and the methods were applied. District commissioners and travelling commissioners were appointed, new courts were established, new codes and new laws were introduced, chiefs were confirmed or deposed and new ones appointed, direct and indirect taxation was introduced, and forced labour was demanded for the construction of roads and railways. All these measures naturally generated various reactions.\nDuring this second phase, while there were differences in the objectives in view, the strategy adopted for the attainment of these objectives by West Africans was the same. The main objectives were three: to regain their independence and sovereignty, which implied expelling the colonial rulers altogether; to seek to correct or redress certain specific abuses or oppressive aspects of the colonial system; or to seek accommodation within it. The strategy that was adopted during this phase was neither submission nor alliance but that of resistance and this took many forms: revolts or rebellions, migrations, strikes, boycotts, petitions and delegations and finally ideological protest. The leadership during this period also remained virtually the same as that between 1880 and 1900, that is mainly that of the traditional rulers.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

The reason given for this merits quotation: ... The development of a lingua franca has very little connection with immediate expediency, being essentially concerned with enduring values and hence with a penetration which however gradual shall steadily become co-extensive with the country. Applying this criterion neither Swahili nor Ganda nor any other vernacular has admissible claims. 40 And this advice went on to add that only English should be recognized 'as the inevitable lingua franca of the future, a fact which general and education policy should admit without delay'.

To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 300, 'article_title': 'ACCRA.', 'full_section_title': 'ACCRA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': ""Our correspondent expresses his fear that the report of Major de Rurignes having been stopped on the Coast, and that he would be brought back to Accra, to wait the result of an inquiry into his conduct, was unfounded, nothing there having been heard of the matter.\n\n*See Dr. Robert Clarke's reports, reviewed in our 23rd, 24th, and 27th numbers.*""}, {'id': 878, 'article_title': 'The ""Standard"" on the Resignation of Office by Earl Russell\'s Ministry', 'full_section_title': 'The ""Standard"" on the Resignation of Office by Earl Russell\'s Ministry', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1866#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_07_1866', 'content': 'We have to announce the failure of the well-known house of Russell, Gladstone, and Co., of Downing-street, wholesale rectifiers, Fran-cheese-mongers, and pepper dealers, whose fall will create the greatest sensation throughout the kingdom as well as abroad, the firm having very extensive foreign connexions.\n\nThe business was first established and carried on under the name of Palmerston and Co., and through the able management of the then senior partner, who gave the name to the firm, it rapidly rose in general estimation, and obtained the public confidence to a very high degree.

The Manchester Chamber of Commerce seems to be imbued with this contempt for West African insignificance, if we may judge by the cold shoulder they have turned on Mr. Hutton. China, Japan, our East Indian possessions, and North and South Atlantic Colonies, which receive their tens of millions of pounds sterling of Manchester goods, cast poor West Africa into deep shade. A little feeling of interest for her was aroused there at the time when civil war in the United States of America interfered with a due supply of cotton; and West Africa was looked to as possessing capabilities for producing the coveted staple. But as Rome was not built in a day, so neither could a large cotton cultivation for export be at a wish inaugurated in the West African Settlements; although something was done, and the production of cotton is constantly on the increase. It is now, no doubt, wearisome to be called upon to occupy the precious time of the Chamber of Commerce with the paltry affairs of countries importing a mere million\'s worth of the products of the Manchester looms. Either this, or Mr. Leigh Clare had monopolized the ear of the Chamber for the erring official who has sown ruin broadcast among the traders of Lagos. We hope, however, that Mr. Hutton will persevere, although, as above stated, we cannot endorse all that he writes; or the inference of the *Manchester Courier*, that the ""present Administration"" (Mr. Gladstone\'s) is worse than its Tory predecessors in its treatment of West Africa. Where could a more staunch supporter be found in the House of Commons of African Governmental abuses and official misrule in West Africa than Sir Charles Adderley? And was he not also one of the warmest advocates of the proposed cession of the Gambia to France? Could it be possible for any Secretary of State to throw a broader shield over official profligacy and judicial tyranny than was held by the Duke of Buckingham before the official culprits at Sierra Leone, Cape Coast, and Accra? No; nothing is to be gained for the West African Settlements by efforts to identify their interests with this or that political party in Great Britain. The evil traditions of the Colonial-office descend from Administration to Administration—from Tory to Liberal, and Liberal to Tory. It is these traditions, the evil system of official appointments, and inveterate defence of official incapacity and misdoing, that we have to combat and destroy. These lie at the very root of all the ruinous error, the abuse of power, the profligacy, and official contempt for the Africans, that characterise our rule on the West Coast. Against these we have always waged war, and shall wage war so long as God may continue to us the power to do so; and we hail Mr. Hutton\'s appearance on the scene of combat with unfeigned delight.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-04-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The West African settlements comprise Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Some of the Difficulties in the Way of Extending Trade in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""A great drawback to the commercial prosperity of the West Coast stations is the fact that there is no real working class. Men who are educated consider themselves too good for labour as agriculturists, and only a very few condescend to become carpenters or blacksmiths. To be a clerk or a trader is the one idea of the native who can read and write and has some knowledge of the first three rules of arithmetic. Those who remain Pagan, or rather who do not frequent the schools and chapels, and live according to old habits, have few wants, and those easily supplied. Six weeks' work in the year will supply corn ample for all their wants, whilst capaiva, bananas, and such like, once a plantation is established, continue to produce for years, and oil and peppers may be had for the trouble of collecting them. Tobacco grows in the country, but the people are usually too idle to cultivate it, and it constitutes the main portion of what they buy from the traders. The cloth to cover their nakedness, and beads, powder, guns, wire, &c., they can buy with a lucky find of gold, or by gathering the fruit of the oil palm to make oil, and bartering it. As a native can live luxuriously on 3d. a day, even if he has no plantation and no wife to cook for him, and for another 3d. he can get drink and tobacco, whilst his housing costs him nothing, and 1s. or 1s. 3d. a day is his usual wages, a man who works for a month or two months in the year can afford to be idle for the remainder. The Gold Coast could be one of the greatest of producing countries if only there were some people in its boundaries who would work. There is scarcely a yard of garden except what is called for by the actual necessities of the people, and plantations for the purpose of export do not exist. As one gets more among the natives who are free from the influences of the coast one looks for some improvement, but except that slavery still exists, and that therefore some people are forced to show a certain amount of industry, there is none to be found. To this lack of industry must be added another great blot on the condition of the country; that is the apathy of the Government with regard to public works, and specially with regard to the improvement of communications. The revenues are hoarded in the colonial chest, and necessary repairs to public buildings are begrudged, whilst any expenditure on improvements is unknown. The roads or tracks are under the supervision of the district commissioners, usually officers of the Houssa constabulary, and are made and cleared in a spasmodic manner by a species of forced labour, in which the greater portion of the work is done by those who receive least benefit. The improvement and construction of landing places, and the construction of a tramway for the transport of oil to a good place of shipment, have been spoken of for years, but the powers that be consider it is more advisable to have a good balance in the treasury than to spend a sixpence on the most needed improvements; and as for the Colonial Office, the general feeling there is that our African possessions are a nuisance, and that if we could get rid of them it would be a good job. This does not apply to the heads of departments or the political chiefs of the Office, though doubtless at times they share in the weariness of their subordinates, but to the rank and file of the Office, who only know of British West Africa by its causing them an extra amount of correspondence."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

We fully agreed in the necessity of a totally independent executive administration for what is now the Gold Coast Colony, which could not be effectively governed from Sierra Leone, if there was to be any departure from the old do-nothing-good policy at Cape Coast. If we are to give credit to what has been now all but officially stated, the present administrative vacancy at Sierra Leone is to be filled up by the appointment to that place of the actual Administrator at the Gambia, Mr. Kortright; who is there to have the title of Governor of the West African Settlements; the Gambia being executively united with Sierra Leone and the Sherbro\' under him. But why should these dependencies be united administratively—and executively, as we hope they will be—under such an exceedingly vague and indefinite title? Why should the name of Sierra Leone, which has been fostered into something akin to metropolitan importance, be thus contemptuously set aside; and Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and Sherbro\', figure only in future as a group of West African Settlements? Is it that Her Majesty\'s Government, sensible too late of the irrevocable and irremediable faults in the past, whereby the commercial future of Sierra Leone has been so compromised and restricted, look upon Sierra Leone as doomed to comparative stagnation and insignificance, while the Gold Coast shall be developing in wealth, power, and dominion? It may be so. There is very much of this aspect about the adoption of such a title, as designating a group of unimportant places which the British Government may find it, in the course of a few years, advisable to retire from, to drop, or to dispose of. We strove heartily, some few years since, to rouse the Sierra Leone people to a sense of their actual and prospective position, and to the true and lasting interests of their country. But Sierra Leone has been too much wrapped up in self-conceit. She thought it enough to puff her cigar and twirl her cane in public promenades, and to await with self-sufficient complacency what, according to ancient heathen parlance, the gods might provide. We have strenuously advocated her right to a metropolitan position as regards the administration of justice on the West Coast; but what voice has been heard in or from her in support of the pretensions we have put forward in her behalf? Alas! alas! enervated by Government expenditure, and the concentration of European educational energies within her, she has become politically and industrially decrepit in her very youth; and we feel bound to confess that we are full of apprehensions with regard to her future. We hear of fiscal and other measures of which we cannot approve, and which can scarcely fail of injurious results; but the intelligence reaches us without those details which are indispensable to a right appreciation of them.

But the town itself is fairer to view from a distance than pleasant to inspect closely. Instead of the charm, the refinement, the cleanliness, and prosperity of St. Louis, I found this English settlement a filthy, forlorn, and uncared-for Darkest England in the land of sunny fountains; a town of misery, crime, and wretchedness, under barbaric English misrule. The town is innocent of even the most elementary principles of sanitation, each tenement emptying its filth so that it is absorbed into the wells, or left to decompose and undergo fetid fermentation wherever it may happen to be thrown. I found the servant of the shanty—euphoniously called an hotel—where I was staying, filching my tea, and substituting for it the brown water of these wells, which, when boiled, is the colour of strong black tea, if not quite of the aroma and taste of the ""cup that cheers."" I pointed out to the medical officer how easy it would be to convert the place into as charming a health resort as St. Louis, but he could not see it. Civil engineers and doctors never agreed, he informed me, on sanitary matters! The irregular, grass-grown streets are but half formed, and, being altogether void of trees or shade, are hot and glaring, fit only for the unhappy native wrecked by drink, who, staggering along them as he emerges from one Government-licensed grogshop to another, finally pitches headlong into one of the many holes and man-traps, there to lie and grow sober under a blistering sun.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812. He would hesitate to put limits to the prosperity and importance of the place. Yet nothing has been effected at Lagos which could not have been accomplished in Gambia and Sierra Leone. The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages. In the past the lethargy which kept British West Africa back, and invited European competition, was universal.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The Young Associations', 'content': ""Something of their attitudes may be garnished from the list of grievances the KCA leadership presented to the governor when the latter visited Muranga in 1925. They protested against the Crown Lands Ordinance of 1915 which had made all Africans tenants at will of the Crown. They also requested the release of Harry Thuku, and asked for an appointment of a paramount chief'with judicial powers for trying our cases, one who should be well educated and to be elected by the majority of our people'. The petition also dealt with the local problems that the colonial administration created for the people, such as the compulsory rebuilding of sanitary huts to prevent plague and the banning of the growing of cotton and coffee by Africans. Finally, it put forward programmes for improvement, asking the administration to expand the training facilities for hospital orderlies, for the building of a high school, and for the setting up of a school for girls. These requests made little impression on the colonial authorities.\nBut official scorn did not deter these leaders. By 1927 something of a rapprochement was made with the Kiambu politicians, when Jomo Kenyatta was asked by the Association to take over the post of general secretary, a job which he took up the following year.\nThe fortunes of the KCA improved in the following two years for reasons both local and international. Kenyatta's efforts as party secretary led to a cultural revival. In his efforts to build up grass-roots support for the Association, Kenyatta appealed to the Gikuyu through Mwigwithania, a Gikuyu-language newspaper he founded, to be proud of their cultural heritage. The pages of the monthly Mwigwithania were full of riddles, proverbs and stories which encouraged the readers to think of themselves as Gikuyu. This paper also narrated the day-to-day activities of the KCA in detail, thus bringing it to the attention of the readers.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose. Examples of these two developments are found among the Igbo of Nigeria, the Gikuyu of Kenya and the Langi of northern Uganda. ! 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80', 'content': 'The Muslim reformers (who included at least one of the last, reforming Hausa kings) had a very different blueprint to institute.

Consequently the amir was chosen not for any inherited quality of sacredness but for his personal piety towards Allah. The amir was the first among equals; his companions as a group were to share power under the amir\'s leadership. As a result, the role of palace slave-officials was to be reduced to that of personal servants and the formal office of queen mother or sister was eliminated. The amir was part of the political process, and his office was theoretically open to any suitably pious candidate. A minimal bureaucracy of ministers, judges, inspectors, police and imams was established as prescribed by the blueprint; and the regulations of the sharTa law, following the Mäliki school of interpretation, were to order relations between persons and between groups. The changes were designed to limit and formalize the political processes, to prevent gross manipulation of previously unwritten rules as well as to curtail the growth of palacecentred government. It was intended to do away with the ambiguity of a Muslim wielding ritual authority based on local, traditional religious belief, and replace it with an authority derived solely from Allah, an authority not only acceptable to the Muslim community but also accountable to it. The blueprint\'s detail is most conveniently set out by \'Abdullah dan Fodio in his book to guide the Kano community on their new constitution, Diyd"" alhukkatn.$^{1}$ But as problems arose, Muhammad Bello and subsequent caliphs wrote letters to the various leaders of nascent communities, outlining the crucial elements of the new system and adding some practical details.

From another viewpoint (also implied in the blueprint), it is a history of the development and purposeful integration of the rural economies of the region, and their closer linking with first the Mediterranean and later the Atlantic economies.

By the 1870s, the successors of the founders in Sokoto had achieved a fair measure of success.

We have not seen a copy of these proposed regulations under which, as we are informed, Government officials are to enjoy the right to six months' leave in every two years, on full pay, and with free passage to and from England. But we presume that as these leave regulations are framed solely on the ground of such absence from the Coast being necessary to the preservation of health, and as such necessity cannot exist as regards Africans, the said right of leave, with its valuable accessories of full pay and passage money, is only to be enjoyed by Europeans, and not by native African officials. To give such privilege to the latter would indeed be to introduce a system of leave for Government employees which does not exist in England, nor, so far as we are aware, in any other country in the world; and it does not seem at all likely that such extraordinary liberality in the public service, as the allowance of three months' leave out of every twelve, would first be bestowed on Africans. We therefore take it as granted that only European officials employed on the West Coast are to be the happy recipients of this liberality. Some points of great interest to the people of the African settlements, therefore, immediately present themselves for consideration. We choose to presume—what ought to be, but what, unfortunately, is not the case—that every European taken into Government employ on the West Coast, whether originally by appointment of the Colonial-office, or by appointment in Africa confirmed by the Colonial-office, is so appointed because, or with the full certainty of, his being fit in every respect for the office he is appointed to. Well, this supposed efficient official is to have, periodically, six months' leave; what guarantee is there to be that the person who becomes his _locum tenens_ for those six months shall be equally efficient, so that the public service shall not suffer, and what remuneration is this substitute to receive? The remuneration of course, whatever it may be, must be paid by the colony in addition to the salary of the absent official, and the expenses of his voyage. Here is a direct double interest which the settlements have in this question—_i.e._, the African people in them—viz., as regards _fitness_ for the duties, and as regards _expense_. But this is not all. We will take a case in point for illustration. There are many of the offices of trust the incumbents of which give security. Mr. Kneller, for instance, Collector of Customs and Treasurer at the Gambia, has given what the Government has deemed adequate security as regards the money under his control. Mr. Kneller, as is at present the case (only that in the present case he is interdicted by a hostile Administrator), is absent on his leave, and a Mr. Fowler—a man recently introduced into the Government service on the West Coast—not by appointment of the Colonial-office, but only by confirmation of that office—this Mr. Fowler, _who has given no security_, becomes Mr. Kneller's _locum tenens_; not by any delegation from Mr. Kneller in virtue of which Mr. Fowler's acts would be the acts of Mr. Kneller, and Mr. Kneller would be answerable for Mr. Fowler's defalcations should he prove a defaulter, but by appointment of his patron and friend the Administrator, who does not take any pecuniary responsibility to the colony in making such appointment. And this is a very serious question. Even in this instance of the Gambia, it appears by the financial statement, which we publish in another column, that Mr. Fowler, the non-security giving _locum tenens_ of Mr. Kneller, has several thousand pounds, and valuable securities of the colony, entirely at his own disposal and in his power; while, in the case of a colony such as Sierra Leone, the amount, at any given time, would be very much greater, the revenue of Sierra Leone being nearly four times that of the Gambia. In the present pressing need of the West Coast Settlements for every penny of their revenue for those improvements without which their progress must be disastrously cramped and slow, the loss of some thousands of pounds by any of them, through the defalcations of a non-guaranteed _locum tenens_ of a guaranteed collector or treasurer, would be a very serious thing; and we do say unhesitatingly that it is the duty of the Colonial-office to impose as a condition of the leave of any such responsible officer, that the person who temporarily performs his duties should be equally guaranteed, either by the Administrator who appoints him, or by some other person or persons. But there are other considerations than pecuniary ones involved, and considerations, too, of the very highest importance. Take another case in point—viz., that of the Chief Magistracy of the Gambia. We published last month, and briefly commented upon, a most objectionable Ordinance, enacted by the Gambia Official Legislative Council at a most objectionable time—and we said unhesitatingly that, after full consideration of all the attendant circumstances, it did appear to us as if the intention was to give the fearful powers conferred by that Ordinance to Mr. Fowler (already referred to) or to some other irresponsible creature of the Administrator. Are the lives and properties of the people of Lagos, Cape Coast, Accra, and the Gambia to be from time to time, for six months at a time, during the absence of the Colonial-office-appointed Chief Magistrate, at the absolute mercy of some creature of the Administrator—which, as shown lately in the case of Mr. Lovell, at Cape Coast, is equivalent to the making an absolute tyrant of the Administrator, who may himself at the time be only _acting_—only the _locum tenens_ of a Colonial-office-appointed Administrator. Then, again, look at Sierra Leone, with no court of appeal, save as from the chief or assistant-judge of the Supreme Court, to the same judge or judges as appeal. Imagine Sierra Leone for six months under the sole judicial management of Mr. Huggins; and imagine Mr. Montague or Mr. Walcott acting at the same time as Queen's Advocate by delegation of the absent holder of that office, or by appointment of some other Governor-in-Chief than Sir Arthur E. Kennedy; or imagine, through the action of the same system, the said Mr. Montague or Mr. Walcott, at the same time, one as Queen's Advocate and the other as Chief Police Magistrate, by virtue of such delegation or appointment, Mr. Huggins being also the only judge! Are not these indeed points of very serious interest? And are we not entitled to demand, on behalf of the African people, that they shall be very seriously considered by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and his permanent Colonial-office advisers? We do demand this on their behalf; and here we must stop for the present, as we find the question far too large to be disposed of in this article in the brief limits within which it is necessarily restrained.""}, {'id': 2144, 'article_title': 'A CONTRAST.', 'full_section_title': 'A CONTRAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_02_1872', 'content': ""Now let us turn our eyes to Sierra Leone, and observe despotism assuming her blandest and most seductive form.

Boyle and Lumpken, to the Legislative Council.

The bait took, and the turbulent fish were quietly landed at Government House. The man who was raised from servitude, and such like him, were invited by Sir Arthur Kennedy to meet Chief Justice French and the officers of the garrison to dinner.

To this end it is to be expected that those who are appointed to positions of trust and responsibility should have the qualifications necessary to discharge their duties, so that they may inspire trust and confidence in those over whom they are placed. When any suspicion is harboured as to the competency of a functionary for advancing the condition of the people, distrust will be the consequence. No effort should be spared, therefore, to secure men of superior caste to displace those sinecurists and pluralists who are preying on the vitals of these benighted possessions. Africa requires good and qualified men to place her in the position she ought to occupy in the scale of communities, and her people would deserve very little credit if they did not raise their hue and cry against the introduction of a policy which threatens to imperil their interests. The silence of the Gambians, whose remonstrance might have some weight with and induce the Colonial Office to closely scrutinize the attainments of the gentleman whom it appoints to the Gambia chief magistracy, is a cause for regret, but is no proof of the chief magistrate's qualification to fill the magisterial chair. Not only are the Gambians unable to assert their rights, but, not being acquainted with the arcana of the Colonial Office, they are afraid to make any representation which is opposed to the acts of that office. Even when their existence as British subjects, not to talk of their property, was proposed to be denationalized, the Gambians did not of themselves remonstrate with the Downing-street authorities on the impropriety of being chaffered away to the French, whose manners and institutions are foreign to those they have learned from the English. Petitions, numerously subscribed by the Gambians and others, were got up, it is true, and laid at the foot of the throne, praying for the discontinuance of the negotiations for the proposed transfer of the Gambia; but the Gambians were not the originators. Messrs. Brown and Quin, yourself, and other philanthropic friends led the van in the defensive warfare to set aside the bold decree of Earl Granville.\n\nNot having the courage openly to express their dissatisfaction at the appointment of Mr. Edwin Adolphus, they grumble over their grievance, and console themselves with the thought that the chief magistrate will one day be recalled from his office.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

In this number of our journal we have put on record the demand made by us for compensation to the victims of the late political persecutions at Cape Coast, and the reply of the Secretary of State thereto. This reply is in the stereotyped official form—the application for compensation ought to come through the local authorities—or, in plain English, through those very officials who have committed the acts and inflicted the injuries complained of, and for which compensation is justly sought. We do not hesitate to say that this rule of the Colonial Service, as it is called—but to which ought to have been added, ""as regards Crown colonies""—lies at the very root of the flagrant misdoings of West Coast officials that we have had so often to expose. But for the interference of the African Times this rule gives up the people of the settlements, bound hand and foot, into the power of a few British Government officials; men for the most part, as we have shown by exposure of their acts and deeds, quite unfitted to be the depositories of such power. What should we say about the police authorities in our streets if it were laid down as a rule by the Home-office that a man who has been robbed must demand justice only through the man who has robbed him; or if a magistrate, when appealed to for protection and justice against a policeman who had abused the power with which he had been entrusted, should reply, ""This demand must come through the policeman, such being the rule of the Home-office""? The thing is monstrous. By refusing to listen to a complaint against a Crown colony official for acts of oppression by him committed, save and except through the medium of that same official, the home authorities identify themselves at the very outset with the official complained of. Their reply to the applicant seems to say, ""You had better either submit quietly, or make peace directly with him, for he is a privileged person, whom we can only condemn provided he sees fit to condemn himself."" Can any reasonable man wonder, after this, that British officials in the West Coast Settlements, which rank as Crown settlements or colonies, should, by lying misrepresentations, continually seek to draw tighter and tighter the fetters that bind the people over and among whom they are appointed to exercise Crown authority? that every such British official should strenuously impede the creation of an elective legislature, by the existence of which alone that arbitrary rule of the Colonial Service can be overpassed? The colonies or settlements under this atrocious system (Crown-colonies or settlements) are happily now but very few in number; and this it is which increases the difficulty with which we have to contend; because if there were many of them we might obtain an associated action that would have weight in Parliament. Under these circumstances it would be wrong to flatter ourselves or the people of the West African Settlements with the belief that we can directly overcome that justice-barring rule of the Colonial-office. All we can do is to take care that the complaints and demands thus made through inculpated officials shall not be burked. This involves the necessity of a duplicate—an exact copy of every complaint or demand forwarded to the Secretary of State, through the local administrator or other authority—being sent at the same time to us, together with the documents or evidence upon which the complaint or demand is based, which justify such demand or complaint and establish a claim to redress. This is the course which we now advise Messrs. Fynn, Fynn, and Forson, and the lately imprisoned officials of the Fanti Confederation to pursue. We will back up their complaint when it shall have been ""forwarded through the local administrator, according to the rules of the Colonial Service,"" and will do our best in every way to obtain for them a just and liberal compensation.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reform in the Administration of Justice', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""from time to time to call attention to abuses and oppression, most serious in their nature and degree, as affecting the fortunes, liberties, and even the lives of Her Majesty's subjects. But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Interesting Report of Executive and Judicial Proceedings at Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Time did not permit me to fulfil the promise given in my last of writing by the following mail, to point out what appears to me to be the exact position of the British Government out here; and I am unable to do so presently, for reasons of which you are aware.\n\nThe fantastic tricks played here by our present Acting Administrator would afford amusement, were it not that they contain matter for serious reflection. The thoughtlessness and utter incapability of the man, were never brought more prominently before the public than immediately after the incarceration of the representatives of the Fanti Confederation. In his tantrums he requested the Chiefs of Cape Coast to give 1,000 armed men to proceed with the troops to Mankessim, to bring down Edoo and Anfoo Otoo, and break up the Confederation; and he told them that if they (the Chiefs of Cape Coast) refused to comply with his request, he would proceed to Anamaboe and obtain 1,000 men from the King of that place; and on his refusal he would bombard the town of Anamaboe, and bring the King a prisoner in chains to Cape Coast. Now comes the best part of the fun, for I am of opinion that his Excellency, pitying our want of entertainment, got this up expressly for our amusement. To be brief, he further stated to the Chiefs of Cape Coast, that after bombarding Anamaboe, and bringing the King of the place up in chains, he would march on with the troops to Salt Pond; and order the people of that town to go in advance of them as scouts; and if any one of them (the Salt Pond people) refused to obey orders, he would have him shot there and then; and if any soldier or policeman got wounded or killed, on his return to Cape Coast he would hang the so-called conspirators on the highest hill in Cape Coast—**without trial!** Is this, Mr. Editor, the talk of a sane person, of one who is aware of the heavy responsibilities attached to his high office? When one filling such a high post talks and raves in this manner, it is calculated to arouse the feelings and passions of the parties governed; and to open their eyes as to the real character of the person placed in authority over them. The conduct of the chief of the Executive here causes one to recollect the old adage about ""the beggar on horseback"" and the old gentleman in black. Having risen to his present position out of nothing, he can hardly realise his present rank; his head is actually turned by being placed on this high eminence.

The fact is, that we are trying a new experiment (if it deserves even such a name) in government on the Gold Coast, as a means of carrying out the recommendations of the House of Commons Committee of 1865. Economy the most rigid is the professed order of the day; Christian civilisation is to be promoted free of cost to Christian and civilised England. People whom many among us profess to believe are scarcely better than apes, are to do what none of the proud races of the world did—i.e., elevate and purify themselves; impelled only by the brilliant examples afforded by a few military officers and mercantile agents. We have come, indeed, to as near an abandonment of the protected territories as we could possibly arrive at without quitting them altogether. We pity the Governor, or Administrator, as he is now called, who is placed by the Colonial-office in so brilliant a position. All tongues and pens have praised Colonel Conran for what he has effected at Cape Coast Town, previously poisoned in its atmosphere by every conceivable filthiness; and we believe he has done all that man could do, _consistently with orders from home_, for the wellbeing of the protectorate. But it is evident he is so fettered that it is difficult, if not impossible, for him to maintain the dignity of his responsible office. To this, and to nothing else, we attribute the inconsistencies exposed by our able correspondents. The Administrator could not humble himself and his Government so much as to say to the clamouring merchants and kings at Accra, ""I am altogether powerless to protect you,"" and so he had no alternative but to do a little bombast, and trust to the chapter of accidents. The latter going against him, the former is put to the test and shown to be what it is; and he gets sore with those who ruthlessly (because they have been injured, and despoiled, and are suffering) expose the want of agreement between high words and meagre action, and falls into the error of trying by recrimination to improve his position; that of the Government whose servant he is, and of which he is evidently most anxious to support the prestige.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE TORTURE SYSTEM IN CAPE COAST PRISON.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have no doubt there have been and are some honourable men connected with the Cape Coast administration who have deplored what was going on, but who, not being legally responsible, overlooked their moral responsibility, because they could not admit it without interfering with heads of departments or denouncing those with whom they were compelled to live and associate. It is thus, where there is no organ of public opinion, that evils and abuses grow and abound, until they attain to an offensive turpitude that renders it impossible for them to be longer concealed. And then they come upon the world like the pestilential vapour of some rotten marsh, where the poison has loaded a dead atmosphere, which becomes at last overcharged.

It is so difficult for them to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the accusations thus made. They cannot be expected on every such occasion to send out a commission of inquiry; they must feel great reluctance, and even repugnance, to discredit in any way their employés, whom it is necessary, in the interests of the public service to support as much as possible.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN ADMINISTRATOR IN PERIL — GENERAL EXPOSURE OF ABUSES IN GOVERNMENT, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## COPIES OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS—ELUCIDATION OF CAPE COAST LAW AND JUSTICE.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_05_1869#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and harbours received the attention of the colonial administrations quite early on. Though these facilities helped in the general administration, their main task was to evacuate exports. No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)\nMost of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies. Construction of the first railway in British West Africa took place in Sierra Leone during the 1890s. The first train started operating in the colony area in 1897, and by 1909 the main line, crossing the rich palm oil belt to Pendembu, in the east (365 km) had been completed. A branch line from Bubuyan to Makeni in the north (132 km) was opened in 1915. Soon after the work started in Sierra Leone, other dependencies followed her example with even better results. All major lines were built by 1920.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation.

And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

A recent strike of the police force was caused by an endeavour being made to compel the police to perform fire brigade duty in addition to their ordinary avocation. Recently, on a fire occurring in the Hausa quarters, great difficulty was experienced in getting the engine out of the Custom House building, and in the interval no fewer than thirty-six houses were burned down. It was then decided to remove the fire engine to the public works, where it could be got at any moment. The authorities also considered that the police ought to perform the fire brigade duty, and for this they agreed to give them extra pay in the shape of overtime. The police objected to the overtime, and as the result refused to perform duty. There was no alternative but to get them arrested by the Hausas. After imprisoning the ringleaders, an arrangement was come to by which the police are to act as a reserve fire brigade. Fifteen men are detailed weekly for the duty, to be succeeded the following week by fifteen others. The fact, however, of the police objecting to obey orders gave the authorities the impression that they could not be relied upon, and on this account the desire for the return of the 300 Hausas sent down to the Gold Coast from Lagos was expressed.—The work of constructing the new railway was stopped when the Loanda passed. This was on account of the rains, but there had also been a number of deaths. It is said that the line is costing more than had been anticipated, and that the money voted for the construction was nearly exhausted, although not much more than one-tenth of the work had been completed. Mr. W. Shalford, M.Inst. C.E., consulting engineer to the Colonial Office for West African Railways, states with regard to the railway being constructed at Lagos: (1) The construction has never been stopped, but during the wet season the rate of construction has necessarily been below the average. (2) During the rainy season, also, there has been the usual increase of sickness, but no death has occurred on the railway staff during the last year and a-half. (3) So far from the line costing more than had been anticipated, it is now certain that the work already constructed has been carried out within the estimate. (4) About one-third of the authorised length has been so far completed that locomotives drawing construction trains are running over it."" These facts show that the paragraph referred to is unfounded, and, as the railway is by far the most important work which has yet been undertaken by the colonial Government, it is much to be regretted that a false impression should be made public.'}]","[{'document_title': 'LAGOS AFFAIRS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We cannot say what may be the news now on its way to England from Lagos. We cannot defer the preparations for our paper until the day of its publication, and are therefore under the necessity of commenting on what is known to us at the time we write. We hope, and have reason to believe, that before our present number goes to press, we shall have received the long desired intelligence of the difficulties with Egbas, Jebus, and others being all removed; and of the long desolate markets of Lagos overflowing with produce. We have not any such news at present; but what we have, affords additional proof of the heavy responsibility that rests upon all concerned in the Government of a trading British settlement or colony, when they, through ignorance or malice, pursue a course which is calculated to bring on a commercial paralysis. By inexcusable ignorance on the part of a Secretary of State, and the very wantonness of official evil on the part of an Administrator, the trade and commerce of Lagos was arrested in its course on the 18th of March last. The authorities of the native interior countries from which Lagos draws its commercial supplies, had been goaded by repeated and incessant insults and wrongs, into a condition of mind which led them to refuse all further trading intercourse, until the official author of those insults and wrongs should be removed from the office which gave him power thus to outrage them and their people. At the first glance it would have seemed as if trade would be immediately resumed, from the moment such removal were made, and the obnoxious measures repealed and abolished; and we must confess that, although our knowledge of African thought and action is derived from the varied experience of many years, we fell into the error of believing that such would be the case in this instance. We thought the Egba authorities and the King of Jebu, knowing as they did that the grievances of which they had so much reason to complain were the unhealthy spawn of one diseased official mind alone—that the quarrel really was between them and the late Administrator of Lagos only, and not really between them and Great Britain, would have hastened to show their satisfaction at the removal of their official enemy from his post and power, and have at once set free the fettered hands of commerce. It has not been so. Captain Glover was sent away from Lagos by Mr. Pope Hennessey, on the 15th June—and all obnoxious decrees, irritating and injurious to the Egbas and others, were at the same time repealed; but yet, up to the 6th August at least, the Egbas and Jebus had not removed their interdict on trade. The venom was still rankling in the veins of those who had been stung, and a sense of offended dignity prevented the due consideration of the evils resulting to their own subjects and territories, as well as to Lagos and its traders, from the prohibition to export that produce on which the wealth and progress of both the one and the other depend. Lagos and its native traders and merchants especially have been thus doomed to a prolonged continuance of those evils to which we briefly alluded in our last; and in the paralysis of all available means for paying debts and obligations, the law—British law—has handed the unfortunate fish to the greedy cormorants who are ever ready to seek their unjust gains among the necessities of their fellow-men. British officials spear the fish—British magistrates net them—and British cormorants devour them. We feel it to be our duty, therefore, to repeat the protest we made in our last, against the uninterrupted action of commercial law, through British legal authorities and tribunals, at periods when the British governing power has chosen for its own ends, or in its own ignorance or wickedness, to cut off from the trading masses of the community, those means by which alone they could be enabled to meet their commercial engagements. During the perturbation caused by the late French and German war—during the siege of Paris, and the reign of the Commune, and for some time after, no creditor was allowed to put the machinery of law at work in France, for the enforcement of civil contracts, to despoil and ruin his fellow-citizen. And thus it ought to have been in Lagos during this suspension of trade, which resulted entirely from acts of Government, and not from any acts or errors of individual traders, or from any cause which any one individual of the trading community, or the whole body of them combined, could suspend or control. They did what they could by remonstrance, by petition, by communication to the Home authorities, and through the African Times; and having done this, they are none of them morally, however they may be made legally, responsible for the results against which they petitioned and remonstrated. We do not need any spirit to come from the other world to tell us that these remarks of ours will not produce the effects they ought to produce. The duty of a public writer is not limited by the extent of his power to procure the justice to which he may establish a claim. It is his duty to hold aloft the lamp of truth, and leave the results of his so doing to others. It is at least a consolation to victims, if the light thus diffused, shall enable every observer to see that the wheels which are crushing the poor victims of commercial misgovernment, are official ones; that they have not voluntarily thrown themselves under them with suicidal intent, but have been thrust under them by an erring Secretary of State, and the malicious wantonness of official power in his delegate, to whom the victim was bound to yield unresistingly. The light thus diffused may, and often does, serve also to prevent the recurrence of errors and wickedness of a similar kind, and thus gradually helps on changes which conduce to an enlarged general security against the errors and aberration of constituted authorities.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1872#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Local Press Mis-statements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—I consider it due to the public to draw attention to the incorrect statements that appear in the three first issues of the _West African Herald_, under the present editor.\n\nIn his first issue (I shall take one instance only out of the numbers that appear in each paper) it is stated that the Fantis, although numbering 70,000 against 12,000 Ashantis, had been defeated by the enemy.

As the editor in his very able and moderate leader has stated, it ought to have been perfectly well known to those having the conduct of the public affairs of the colony that a mission thus dispatched would be certain to offend the just susceptibilities of a Native Government that in its relation with Lagos since it became a British colony has always stood upon its dignity and independence, and refused to abate one jot or tittle of its claims to respect.

It is reported that we shall ere long miss the present Administrator for the more lucrative post at the Gold Coast, and should the report be confirmed, the Gambia will have lost one of her best Administrators, who, while courteous to all, is equally strict, in point of business, to all his officers alike, without regard to colour or class. Just now investigations are being carried on in connexion with the Colonial Hospital, where a sick man was taken for treatment, and accordingly reported to the Colonial Surgeon; the poor man died without having been seen by the Colonial Surgeon, though it is reported he had knowledge of the circumstance prior to the man\'s death.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

This is a subject of great importance, especially when it is considered that it must be mainly owing to the exertions of a police, under judicious and well-defined regulations, that crimes can be brought to the notice of the authorities and punished. In the absence of such regulations, the name and office of police are mere mockeries. We deeply regret, then, to state that, literally speaking, there is not a single written rule for the guidance of the Lagos police. Some time in 1869 a few directions were put in writing by the then Superintendent, but it is believed these were mere private memoranda for his own guidance, for they were neither signed by him nor sanctioned by the then Administrator; consequently, the succeeding Superintendents have never been able safely to use them as official. Further, not even when peculiar exigencies in the colony need special rules for their treatment, do the police have these supplied to them. This state of things greatly hinders the efficient working of the police scheme in Lagos, and has many a time put matters in great confusion—e.g., when your October issue appeared with a letter condemning the apathy of the Lagos Government on the question of domestic slavery in Lagos, carried on under the Administrator\'s very nose, general orders were issued from Government House for the police to be on the alert to bring slave-dealers to justice. There being no special rule as to how this was to be done, or on what grounds the police were to apprehend people, or how they were to prosecute them, and nine-tenths of them being illiterate men, great confusion took place. The Administrator himself was at a loss how to manage to get certain arrested parties convicted, without incurring the displeasure of his friend and confidante, Chief (?) Taiwo; and the Acting Stipendiary Magistrate (Mr. C. D. Turton) and the Superintendent of Police were threatened by one Monsieur Callamand with a law-suit if they did not prove against him the charge of slave-dealing, for which he had been summoned to the Police-court. All these things prove the absolute necessity there exists for established rules to guide the police in their action; for, had there been such, his Excellency would have known at once how to have acted in the matter, instead of sending for remanded prisoners from the House of Correction, and assembling them before Chief (?) Taiwo, to tell them they were free. The Superintendent of Police, too, did not know what he was taking a summons against Callamand for; hence he narrowly escaped having a law-suit about his ears. Moreover, this state of things lessens the authority of the police, and renders nearly abortive their exertions to maintain ordinary peace; for when once the people of Lagos think that Taiwo\'s influence with Mr. Dumaresq is sufficient to free them from the hands of the police, there is no knowing what amount of mischief they will do. But for the African Times, we say,—but for your able leader in the November issue on the subject of Lagos slave-dealers, at this time there would be seen about in the streets of Lagos slave-dealers asking those they meet, ""You want buy man?""

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief.

Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one.

The responsibility of a Government is in no way lessened, but rather increased, when they devolve any of their powers to a company, one of whose objects is the obtaining of pecuniary profits; and this is accentuated in the case where those placed under the jurisdiction of such a company are imperfectly civilised, and lacking in means by which those governed have the power of making known and removing the grievances under which they suffer.\n\nAnother responsibility which rests upon the Government which grants a charter to any among its subjects, is that of preventing them from using those privileges in such a manner as to conflict with the rights of their fellow-subjects, or so as to involve the commonwealth in political difficulties with other countries.\n\nThose who accept the charter have a heavy responsibility as well as those that grant it, and in this responsibility every owner partakes. Men may of their own free will, and for many reasons, abstain from exercising their political rights in their own country: in most cases they become possessed of those rights without any exertion on their own part, and if they do exercise them, do not do so for pecuniary profit.

PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Disgraceful Administration', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Past been given to us by persons on whom we ought to be able to rely, when accounting for the failure of legitimate and heavy complaints on matters affecting the health, lives, and fortunes of merchants, traders, and the general public, to produce any effect upon the Home Government, or lead to any correction of abuses, to any remedy for gross and abominable evils. Nor can we in any other way account for such maladministration as appears before us in the accounts we are continually receiving. People in power, of whatever grade in official life, do not generally uphold incompetence and crime because they have any attachment for the incompetent and the criminal, whereas all history proves how they may be sheltered and upheld by the potent influence of female charms working in their behalf. The Gambia and its officials, high and low, are nothing to us except as the Gambia is a part of that Africa which we so ardently long to see brought out of darkness into light. And every British Administration on the Coasts of that Africa ought to be as a clear light shining in a dark place; not as a lurid flame from a smoking mephytic torch. The latest news which has come to us from the Coast is to the effect that the yellow fever is prevalent at St Louis (Senegal), and that the British authorities at the Gambia have imposed a four days\' quarantine on vessels and persons coming from the infected districts. The mention made of this fever in the French Chamber of Representatives establishes the fact of its existence at the Senegal, and that the news received through other channels is not an unfounded rumour. All our old fears for the population at the Gambia, both European and native, are thus again revived, and we are inclined to curse in our heart and all every of the officials, whoever they may be, that are jointly answerable for the sanitary condition of Bathurst being such as holds out an invitation to the worst and most fatal of epidemics. Read what ""Junius"" writes: ""Bathurst is not a bit cleaner than a pig-sty; even the Augean Stable could not have been so offensive as some of its streets;"" while the cemetery is in a state most revolting and dangerous. And this, be it observed, while there is an acknowledged surplus of 20,000l. (or a little more or less) in the public chest of the colony! What we wrote in our last, when commenting on the neglect of the Eucalyptus, we now repeat, that authorities who allow such a state of things to continue while they have means at their disposal for removing the danger, are guilty of the lives of every human being whose death may fairly be traced to such malarious influences. The streets, the drains, the cemetery at Bathurst ought to be put and kept in a proper state. Every criminal, never mind how charming his protectress may be, should be dismissed from the police, and that force (the only public one of which the settlement can now boast) be made an efficient and dependable one, and not a mere official appendage for State occasions and display. If this force were a properly organized and dependable one, it might, one would think, be made to afford some protection to traders up the river, who are now left entirely to the tender mercies of the riverain chiefs and predatory tribes. Bathurst, in itself, produces nothing that could enable a penny of revenue to be obtained there. The whole revenue, as ""Junius"" states, is derived from the trade up the river. Twenty to twenty-five thousand pounds a year is levied by Customs\' duties on that trade; and yet no protection whatever is now given to it, except at the entry port; and, as ""Junius"" affirms (and many others affirm to us), ""every complaint about the treatment by the natives on the river is answered in effect that the complainant should not have gone to the river."" What a model rule for a commercial settlement! These matters, thus briefly touched upon, are so important that we cannot afford any time or space for the iron bridge pillars (!) planted in a quick-sand by some talented official, which serve to upset boats, and can be themselves effectually rooted out by the weight of a couple of poor drowning wretches clinging to them. The sanitary condition of Bathurst, the police of Bathurst, and the total insecurity for the merchant and trader of trade up the river, from which all the public revenue has to be derived, are enough for us just now. We are entitled to demand, in the name of the merchants, traders, and people of Bathurst, that the shameful state of things that has so long prevailed be put an end to, and a new state of things be inaugurated and preserved. Of what avail, we may here ask, will it be to make the spasmodic effort of despatching Lieutenant Dumbleton, Surgeon Browning, and others ""with a large number of handsome presents, which have been specially selected in London for the kings and chiefs of the interior,"" unless something be done for the protection of trade up the Gambia River? Without this, the expedition will really be a Bumbledom affair, merely serving for the employment and glorification of certain officials, and as a mode of disposing of some of the surplus Gambia revenue. We have a well-founded distrust of expeditions to the interior got up in this way, while no adequate effort is being made for the legitimate extension and protection of trade up the river. Up to McCarthy\'s Island the river ought to be safe as an English highway. Beyond that, the Bathurst Administration, if it were worth anything, ought to be yearly extending its absolute protecting influence. But to think of increasing the trade by merely sending costly presents all the way along the route to Timbuctoo, in presence of such an expedition as that sent out by the French Government from the Senegal, of which we have already given account, is, we will not say an absurd delusion, but an official flash in the pan, to blind the eyes of the uninitiated, and infuse the belief that spasmodic imbecility is profound and reliable wisdom. Already the trumpet has been sounded in the English press, and we expect to see wondrous bob-majors rung on the official bells, resounding far and near through a press far too ready to take colonial officials at their own valuation. When we know that the reforms we have pointed out have been effected at the Gambia—that prejudicial favouritism through unworthy female influence is at an end—that the town has been made fit to live in, and that trade is protected up the river,—then perhaps we may be ready to join in the peals of official laudation for the ""costly presents"" sent in the direction of Timbuctoo.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1881#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA AUTHORITIES AND HOSPITAL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have again a mass of correspondence on the subjects of the Gambia authorities and the Colonial Hospital.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress. Occasionally our path is cheered by some enthusiastic testimony to the good we are effecting; but for the most part we have to complain of a seeming apathetic indifference, which greatly dishonours those who evince it. We are entitled, after eleven years of unrequited labour, to say, that it is a flagrant disgrace to every African who can read and does not subscribe to this paper and pay for it. Men ought to feel ashamed to borrow it of their neighbours when they can themselves procure it by paying the modest sum of five shillings a-year for it. The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

1235,The assignment of multiple roles to colonial officials in Africa often led to conflicts of interest and compromised the effectiveness and impartiality of governance.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that the assignment of multiple roles to colonial officials in Africa often led to conflicts of interest and compromised the effectiveness and impartiality of governance. The General History of Africa describes how colonial officials, initially intended to serve as advisers to traditional rulers, frequently became de facto dictators, manipulating traditional leaders to enforce unpopular measures such as forced labor and taxes. This not only led to a loss of prestige for traditional rulers but also incited revolts against them. Furthermore, colonial administrators often assumed roles as surrogate chiefs, blurring lines of authority and governance, while the imposition of European bureaucratic structures distorted and weakened African institutions. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight specific instances, such as Mr. Barry, who simultaneously held positions as the Queen's Advocate, Acting Chief Justice, and Acting Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Thomas Jones, who managed numerous civil appointments while serving as Colonial Surgeon. These dual roles created conflicts of interest, particularly in the administration of justice, where individuals could act as both prosecutor and judge, leading to inefficiency and potential bias. The articles criticize these practices for their negative impact on the local population and the administration's reputation, particularly in the Gold Coast. Together, these sources illustrate how the concentration of power in a few individuals led to governance issues and conflicts of interest, reinforcing the claim that such assignments compromised effective governance.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that the assignment of multiple roles to colonial officials in Africa often led to conflicts of interest and compromised the effectiveness and impartiality of governance.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Examples of these two developments are found among the Igbo of Nigeria, the Gikuyu of Kenya and the Langi of northern Uganda. ! 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place. However, policy ran a long gamut, from reluctant acceptance and forced adaptation of such structures as in Portuguese Angola and German East Africa, to considered efforts at institutional preservation as in British Northern Nigeria or French Morocco. Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures.

'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action.

In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

What, then, can be urged in favour or excuse of an arrangement by which an individual is, in his capacity of Queen’s advocate, the public and official prosecutor, and sits also as judge, in his capacity as acting chief justice, for the trial of the very causes he has, as Queen’s advocate, promoted and undertaken to substantiate? Surely this is a most flagrant impropriety; and we cannot be surprised that observers should challenge the purity and impartiality of justice thus administered or maladministered. But as if this was insufficient, that very time was chosen for promulgating new orders and regulations as regards pleading in the courts at Cape Coast were at the same time promulgated and enforced. Previously, any person might appear as advocate or counsel for a prisoner—any one might conduct or defend a suit in the court. But all this was changed. No one could thus appear without having a licence, for which a sum of five guineas per annum was directed to be first paid; no one but persons approved of by the Chief Justice or Acting Chief Justice could obtain such licence—and such licence could be at any time revoked at the pleasure of the said Chief Justice.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters. The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

Were I as wise as the serpent and as long-suffering as Job, the Government of the Gold Coast would still exhaust my experience, and would overtax my patience too.\n\nI have been provoked to the expression of an opinion. I think, then, that the tangible faults of the Government of the Gold Coast are these:—\n\n1. The changes of the governors are too frequent. The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Sir Arthur Kennedy's Appointments to Public Offices"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It shows an unhealthy state of feeling on the West Coast that no sooner do we find it to be our duty to express our disagreement with some of the official acts and words of Sir Arthur Kennedy as Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, than we receive letters, both from friends and adversaries of Sir Arthur, in which it is taken for granted that, for some reason or other not expressed by us, we have placed ourselves in unreasoning opposition to Sir Arthur in all his acts, and deeds, and words, instead of giving him, as we have so long done, our friendly support. So strongly is this feeling expressed that the list of official appointments of Africans, which we insert on another page, is sent to us with the expression of doubt that we shall insert it. This is very unjust to us, and measuring us by a standard that ought not to be applied to us. So far from feeling any disinclination to do so, we are only too happy to insert anything that can place the many good official acts of the actual Administrator-in-Chief prominently beneath the eyes of all men, and we beg to thank our informant for putting us in possession of the means for showing all that has been done in the very important question of the filling the public offices in Africa with Africans. The list shows that a very steady move in this most right and much desired direction has been made by the present head of the Executive. Having said thus much, we must now be allowed to vindicate our own consistency. We have from time to time praised what has been done in the above-mentioned direction. We praised when and where we thought praise was due; and as we do not know within our own heart what a personal animosity is, we shall never fail to do so. But this does not take from us the right to disapprove when, in our anxiety for the advancement of African interests, we see, or fancy we see, just reason for disapproval. It is complained that we inserted a letter reflecting on the head of the Executive at Sierra Leone for appointing an English mercantile clerk there to a Government office without his being subject to competitive examination. It appears, however, that the facts are as stated; and we must say that we do not think they are fully answered by the statement that some Africans have been moved up a step in public offices without being subject to competitive examination. Our own opinion is that continuous competitive examinations for those who are already in the public employ are unjust; that a man once admitted into an office is entitled to be moved up to the superior grades in the same office, subject to his being reduced again should he show a manifest incompetency. As we understand the letter and complaints we inserted, it was not that a European had been admitted to an office instead of an African, but that he had been admitted without a competitive examination being held for establishing that he was more worthy by his attainments than any of the possible African candidates.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy.

The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy.

Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed.

The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system. These various strategies and measures proved on the whole unsuccessful, and by the end of the period under review, colonialism had become firmly entrenched in the whole of West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'With the effective end of the Atlantic slave trade and the increased demand for gold, palm oil, palm kernels and peanuts from western Africa, sugar cane from Mauritius, RØunion and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as ivory and cloves from East and Central Africa, there was an increased demand for captives not only to produce these goods, but also to transport them by headload or by canoes down to the coast. Plantation slavery emerged, either in the form of slave settlements in the rural areas managed according to customary law on the Guinea coast, or Islamic law in the Muslim areas, or approximating to American-type plantations in the Indian Ocean islands. With the increased use of people of slave origin as warriors and in administrative positions at various courts, it has been estimated that in many parts of Africa slave populations could range between 25 and 50 per cent of the total population.$^{19}$ Although there were examples of slave revolts, and the particular example of the Lozi who threw off their Kololo overlords,$^{20}$ generally the slave populations did not form a distinct class. The bulk performed menial jobs, largely as agricultural labourers. However the substantial groups of warriors and domestic slaves, and the significant few who rose to positions of trust and power as successful warriors, traders or administrators, and the variations in their fortunes and life styles, made combination as a class of slaves very difficult.

Elsewhere, the prevalent ethos was acculturation and integration into the society through individual households. While the degree of integration was clearly limited - as witnessed by the number anxious to be redeemed or, having been emancipated by colonial laws, who were anxious to return to their original homes - it was real enough to suggest that the dynamics of change in most of the African communities was the tension of age and sex within each household, and of status and competition for power between the lineages and kinship groups, rather than between broad classes in society.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 429, 'article_title': 'Administration of Justice—Terrible Revelations', 'full_section_title': 'Administration of Justice—Terrible Revelations', 'last_edit_date': '04-14-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1864#article-15', 'issue_date': '23_08_1864', 'content': ""Sir,—If Africa is to make known her wrongs—and your journal has been put forward to accomplish that end—let me write you something which I will defy the powers of Cape Coast to gainsay.

The coroner's inquest, which took place in July last, reveals a state of things more worthy of the most barbarous ages, than of the civilisation and sanitary advancement of the year 1868. The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying. What attention this displayed upon the part of the physician and jailer of the prison! Chief Magistrate Parker is so fond (in the indulgence of an ignorant and despotic spirit) of crowding prisons, surely he should see that some sort of sanatory provision should be carried on within their dismal\n\nprecincts!

It is full of horrors, but we can truly say that the half is not told, for Mr. Felkin has given us viva voce descriptions of barbarities, which are daily enacted in these blood-stained regions, that are too horrible to record on paper:—\n\n""It must not be supposed that the Arabs do all the fighting, or perform all the atrocities of which the conquered people are the victims. There are various tribes of black men, specially the cannibal Niam-Niams, so graphically described by Dr. Schweinfurth, who are even more fiendlike than the Arabs. Moreover, the slave-hunters\' armies are composed of slaves who are often more ferocious than their captors. When a party of slave-hunters wish to make a raid, they visit some friendly chief, and by presents and promises cajole him to assist them in their terrible work. They then join forces and prepare to attack some neighbouring tribe, whose cattle are to be given to the black and friendly allies, whilst the Arabs carry off the human spoil. Then in the early morning, before the sun has risen, the combined forces steal upon their sleeping and unsuspecting victims. Some of the huts and houses are first fired, and then in the confusion which ensues, the men capable of bearing arms are shot down, and the old of both sexes are butchered with every refinement of cruelty, and all the young men, young women, and children are chained and yoked together to be driven off and sold as slaves. In the long and painful march fresh horrors are of hourly and daily occurrence. Those who fall out of the line, and can no longer drag the heavy and ponderous sheebah, or wooden yoke, are murdered in cold blood or left to perish of hunger. Women, who are nursing, have their babies dashed against a stone before their eyes, as it is known they could not carry their burden for many days. In order to strike terror into a tribe, it is a common practice to seize the headmen, and after burying them up to their necks with their faces towards the fierce African sun, to cut off their eyelids, and leave them to die in torments.

The captives, Messrs. Stern, Rosenthal, and the English Consul, have not only not been set at liberty, but have suffered from great violence. According to information, received from different authorities, the prisoners find themselves placed in the most pitiful condition, as the rainy season has gravely affected their health. The ostensible cause of ill-treatment on the part of the King seems to lie in the discovery which his Majesty made in the journal of Messrs. Stern and Rosenthal as to his maternal descent. Mr. Stern mentions in his confiscated paper that the King\'s mother had been a vendor of kosso, a medicinal fruit that is constantly used by the Abyssinians. Mr. Stern was quite right in his assertion, for it is true that the King\'s mother was a seller of kosso, whereas his father was a relation of Dedjaji Comfoo, the governor of Dembea, who beat back several times the Egyptian troops that came from Senaar. In the beginning of his reign the King (who was then a kind and liberal man, and not a despot, as he has become since the death of Mr. Bell, his adjutant, who kept him in a moral check) often used to say, ""If I do not help the poor people they will complain of me before God, for I myself have been a poor man."" Had Theodoros been a man of Napoleon\'s stamp, he would not have felt ashamed of his descent, nor would he have had recourse to the absurd idea of being descended from King Solomon, who had a son, as the Abyssinians say, called Menelik, who was sent to Ethiopia, which was then subjected to the Queen of Sheba. Hence the Royal Family of Abyssinia consider themselves to this day the lineal descendants of Solomon, an idea to which King Theodoros attaches the greatest importance, and which he is said to have strongly stated in his late correspondence with Napoleon to outdo the latter in respect of genealogy. Theodoros, very angry at Mr. Stern\'s assertion, wished to know the source from which he had derived his information. As he would not mention the name of his informant, the King ordered him and Mr. Rosenthal to be beaten and put to the Abyssinian rack—i.e., the wrist of the hand and upper part of the arm of both gentlemen were firmly tied with ropes, in consequence of which the blood was forced out of the tips of the fingers After the prisoners had confessed the rack was removed, but one may imagine how dreadfully they suffered.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way. A large proportion died within a few days; and as the names of all these persons were recorded in the hospital books, the percentage of deaths was thereby largely increased.""\n\n*(To be continued.)*', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Death of a European from Improper Treatment in the Prison at Accra', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Henry Richter: I am head gaoler at Accra.

We need only refer to one pamphlet, published in 1833, under the title, ""Three Months in Jamaica in 1832."" This little publication had an enormous sale, and did much to rouse the British nation to a sense of the enormities daily committed in her distant colonies. The author went out to Jamaica with the intention of residing in a business capacity on a sugar plantation. He was one of those who did not believe in the horrors of slavery, and thought that our factory children in England were worse off than any plantation slaves. He was soon undeceived. Proceeding on horseback to the estate soon after his arrival, and enjoying the exquisite tropical scenery, he came upon a gang of negroes at work, most of them females. As he rode past the driver cracked his tremendous whip, shouting out, ""Work! work!"" and from that moment the enchanting scenery and the beautiful humming-birds of Jamaica had no longer any charm for him. The first evening of his arrival at the plantation the overseer gave the command, ""Blow shell!"" A large shell was blown, and four athletic negro drivers appeared, bringing in six slaves. For some slight defect in the tally of the day\'s work these men had to be flogged. The flogging of the men is described in terms too painful to repeat; but worst of all is the account given of similar punishments inflicted upon women, some of them quite young girls. The author took pains to inquire whether this treatment was general, and he came to the conclusion that it was next to impossible to find a slave, either male or female, who had not been flogged. But this was only one and the most ordinary form of punishment; the stocks and contrivances for hanging negroes by their thumbs, wrists, etc., were only too common, whilst hundreds were killed outright. This picture is too revolting to contemplate at the present day, and to us now it appears almost incredible.\n\nIt is refreshing to record the feelings of joy and gratitude with which Mr. Buxton and his friends received the accounts of ""the admirable conduct of the negroes on the great day of freedom."" Mr. Buxton says: ""Throughout the colonies the churches and chapels had been thrown open, and the slaves had crowded into them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the solemn moment, all hushed in silent prayer.

Nothing but the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit can change the blood-thirsty natives into children of peace and love: ""Every now and again, some of these heathen people show their thirst for blood by committing some horrible deed of wickedness. A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks. When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also. Frequently these palavers occupy much of our time, but it is not time lost; for it increases our influence for good amongst them, and often saves greater evils and the depression and stoppage of trade, both among themselves and between them and the European merchants.""', 'last_edit_date': '1871-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cameroons—Human Sacrifices', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This river has lately been the scene of some of those deeds of bloodshed in which savages, unchecked by the ties of religion and civilization, or undeterred by the fear of consequences, delight.\n\nAn old custom demands that, on the death of a king or chief of note, one or more human victims shall be sacrificed in his honour. Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me.

The arrangement of such authority was asymmetrical, no matter how little existing institutions were modified or subsumed to European needs. At the pinnacle of the administrative system stood the governor or residentgeneral who, while ultimately responsible to his national government, frequently enjoyed the powers of a sovereign.\nThe institutional framework within which he acted varied considerably in size and complexity, but he was usually assisted in the inter-war period by some form of consultative council or commercial interests. The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa. The continued use of this military term was a reminder of the nature of colonial acquisitions. Over the cercle, a European administrator exercised colonial authority and directed both the activities of his European subordinates and the African authorities enlisted in the colonial administration."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.746, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it. In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate and Borno', 'section_title': 'The Sokoto caliphate: 1820-80 > The emirates: political structure', 'content': ""In the case of Katsina, the original, rather limited lineage-based cen› tralization gave way, in the face of militarism, to an increasingly autocratic palace government. These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi. The links between these representatives of the local population and the upper levels of the administration were in the hands ofjakadu, servants or agents of the office-holder allocated the responsibility for that section of the population. Similarly, messengers linked the office-holder to his amir. The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

It cannot be doubted that innocent defendants are occasionally victimised in England, as well as in Sierra Leone, by actions got up expressly for costs by low and unprincipled attorneys; and if a remedy could be found for this, that would not involve a denial of justice to others who have been so wronged as to afford them good and legitimate\n**97**\n\nground of action, we should rejoice to see it applied in England as well as in Sierra Leone; but until then the law had better be left as it is, both in the mother country and in the colony.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all more or less acquainted with the phrase, ""grandmotherly government,"" and know how much annoyance is caused—and that, too, with but little corresponding advantage—when the Legislature takes upon itself to decide upon minor questions of purely social interest, the solution of which is best left to the individual; but the complaint of the inhabitants of the West African Settlements is not that now and then the Legislature meddles with matters best left to individual judgment, but that the people are altogether suffering from ""over-government."" In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

But our efforts at correction through publicity and superior official enlightenment, must necessarily be slow in operation; while it is only in very flagrant cases that we can at all interfere. We foresaw this when the Home Government abolished the Supreme Courts in all the settlements but Sierra Leone; replacing the Supreme Court Judges by Magistrates inferior in rank and position; with salaries too inadequate to attract a good class of men; and with, as a sole supposed corrective, a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone, incomplete, and therefore worthless, in its organization, and, moreover, so expensive in its action as to make it entirely inefficient in the purposes for which it was ostensibly created. In vain we called attention to this very objectionable state of things, amounting, but far too often, to a grievous denial of justice, and not infrequently a perpetration of gross injustice. In vain we proposed changes which we think we proved to be necessary. The defects in the Judicial and Magisterial organization, and as an inevitable consequence in the administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, remain to this day without any remedy having been applied. We have been patiently waiting for one, and have been comparatively silent; but our duty forbids the longer continuance of that silence, and impels us again to renew our earnest demand for it. The necessity has indeed now become most urgent. Successive events during the past two years have made this so patent to every anxious observer, that we cannot refrain from expression of surprise that Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies has not long ere this cut the ground of complaint from under our feet. What we ask for the people in the West Coast Settlements is what every one living under British dominion is entitled to demand—a clear, impartial, enlightened, unimpeachable administration of justice. Without this, no man's property, liberty, or life is secure. Proceedings at Cape Coast under Mr. Salmon's mental aberration (caused by the adoption of a constitution for the Fanti Confederation to enable the native kings and chiefs, among other most desirable objects, to organize their country defensively against Ashanti invasion, the perpetual imminence of which they were but too sensible of) set this in a very strong light. That the same man should be at the same time the legal adviser of the Local Government in haling men to prison, the counsel to frame the indictment, and the judge to sit and try them, was a disgrace to British rule. We exposed it in our columns, we animadverted upon it in letters to Earl Kimberley. But, alas! we have but too often to encounter an official obtuseness against which all reasoning, however conclusive, all array of facts, however indisputable, seems to be powerless. Nothing was done by the Home Government; the administration of justice sank under odium and contempt; tens upon tens of cases were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of a court that no longer inspired any other feelings than those of hatred and distrust. And now again we have the disgraceful fact thrust before us. The Local Government insists upon what appears to the people concerned an illegal and arbitrary demand; these people are British traders; they appeal by petition and representation to the chief of the Executive against what they are willing to suppose to have been an error and excess of subaltern employés; when, lo! they are informed not only that the Governor persists in the demand made by the departmental chiefs, but that it is useless for them to kick against it, because the legal adviser of the Governor is the Chief Magistrate, who would have to try the case should it be brought before the tribunal; and he has advised that the demand is legal, and ought to be enforced. No one surely but those who have been accustomed to watch proceedings in the West Coast Settlements would ever have believed that the administration of justice could have fallen so low, where that administration is in the name of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. We confess to feeling it as a personal disgrace, and cannot but wonder that Earl Kimberley and Mr. Hugessen have not so regarded it. We have instanced these Cape Coast proceedings because they are so flagrant. But the complaints from Bathurst and Lagos, as produced before Earl Kimberley by the deputation of African merchants, &c., on the 3rd May, are not less pregnant with disgrace to British rule. Earl Kimberley took the position that there was a Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone. It seems to have been vainly urged, in reply, that the expenses and difficulties attendant upon a resort to it are such as to make it a very mockery and delusion. It is, in fact, an absurdity, as we have exposed over and over again, years and years ago. We question if there was ever a more crass creation of human folly proceeding from British Secretaries of State—men who ought to be supposed to radiate enlightenment to all parts of Her Majesty's dominions. This so-called Court of Appeal was constituted by the addition of a second Judge to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; the two Judges forming the Court of Appeal. What is this, as regards Sierra Leone cases, but an appeal, even when both Judges are in residence, from Philip drunk to Philip sober. The addition of a second Judge for such a Settlement as Sierra Leone, to be paid for out of its meagre revenues, was therefore a gross injustice to Sierra Leone itself, which, with a population of some 40,000, did not certainly need two Judges in its Supreme Court. And while thus an unjust burden on Sierra Leone revenues, this new Court, thus constituted, is a pretentious cheat as regards Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Before this Court was constituted, with a pretence of benefit for those Settlements, at the expense of Sierra Leone, each Settlement had its Supreme Court Judge, and its Queen's Advocate as the legal adviser of the Executive. At that period the revenues of some of those Settlements was so small, that the Home Government was under the necessity of supplementing the local revenues for the necessary expenses of the Executive and Judicial Administration. But, in abolishing those Supreme Court Judges and Queen's Advocates, it was a very unjust proceeding, even had the so-called Court of Appeal been properly constituted, to cast the burden of it on Sierra Leone. It is quite clear that the expense falling on Sierra Leone should have been for one Supreme Court Judge only, and that the additional expenses of the said Court of Appeal should have been apportioned among the other Settlements. No sooner, however, had the Secretary of State for the Colonies begun to make the new arrangements than he (and his Cabinet colleagues, we may suppose) became sensible of the gross absurdity, as well as injustice, of constituting a Court of three Judges at such a place as Sierra Leone, to be paid out of Sierra Leone revenues. But this was only because he was blundering with the outlines of a crude idea, instead of having formed a new and comprehensive scheme for the administration of justice in all the Settlements in a way that the rising importance of those Settlements justly demanded, that increased facilities of rapid communication rendered possible and easy, and the reputation of Great Britain indispensable. We attacked the halting policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter. We did not ask for the restoration to the other Settlements of their suppressed Supreme Courts; but we asked for the completion of the Court of Appeal, and the utilization of its Judges for administering justice in the other Settlements. A pure and enlightened administration of justice is of such paramount importance that no trifling pecuniary motives ought to be allowed to interfere with it. What we asked for then, we ask for now. Complete the Court of Appeal at Sierra Leone by the appointment of a third Judge; increase the salary of the Queen's Advocate there; let the salaries of these Judges and that Advocate be equally borne by all the Settlements, the quota of each being made proportionate to its revenues; let the ordinary day by day administration of justice at Bathurst, the Gold Coast, and Lagos be carried on as at present, but let one of these Sierra Leone Judges, attended by the Queen's Advocate, go circuit to these Settlements every three months, in the same way that the Judges of Assize go circuit in England; let all cases of a certain importance be reserved for hearing by these Supreme Court Judges, and the decisions of the Magistrates in cases heard during the intervals between the Supreme Court sittings be liable to examination and revision by him, should the parties concerned, or either of them, have given notice of appeal against the Magisterial decision; the Circuit Judge to have power\n**173**"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-08-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It may also be added that the absence of any certain and speedy communication between the settlements in those days had, doubtless, some share in leading the Committee of 1842 to recommend the separation of all the governments.\n\nThe arrangement now contemplated will make it necessary to provide the colonies with greater facilities for intercommunication than they at present possess; and in making the necessary provision for this purpose, it will be right to consider whether it will not be also possible so to arrange that the settlements having an extensive sea-board or much internal water communication may be assisted in maintaining that regular and certain intercourse with their people, which is one of the surest guarantees for the preservation of peace.\n\nSierra Leone, as the headquarters of the general Government, will require the exclusive services of a small steamer suitable for visiting the settlements. Having several outlying dependencies, and much internal water communication, she will also need the aid of a vessel of light draft of water, capable of running up the smaller creeks.\n\nThe Gambia has only her river, for the navigation of which sufficient provision is already made by a steamer supplied by the Imperial Government, and supported partly by the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Governor Freeman, before leaving Lagos for England, issued the following\n\n**PROCLAMATION.**\n\n*By his Excellency Henry Stanhope Freeman, Governor, Commander-in-Chief in and over the Settlement of Lagos and its Dependencies, and Vice Admiral of the same, &c., &c., &c.*\n\n""Whereas his Excellency is about to leave Lagos for a few months, and is desirous that the inhabitants should not have any cause or excuse for discontent during his absence; and whereas he has seen that in many parts of the town houses and premises are fallen down through want of proper protection from the rain, and knowing that Calabar mats cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers to repair all damages daily occurring:\n\n""His Excellency has therefore been pleased to postpone, for six months, carrying into execution the provisions of the Ordinance No. 8, of the 9th April, 1863.\n\n""In making this concession, his Excellency cannot but refer to the seditious spirit which was shown by the inhabitants of Lagos about six weeks ago, when compliance with the ordinance was urged upon them.\n\n""This rebellious spirit entirely prevented the accomplishment of the wishes of the people; for it is not by seditious meetings and threats of insurrection that this Government can be guided.\n\n""The inhabitants of Lagos having yielded and shown their respect for law and order, his Excellency has much pleasure in granting them their desire.""\n\nThis is a sample of the grandiloquent in African colonial government, and is characteristic of the course hitherto pursued in the colony where it was promulgated.

An order to cover all the houses with Calabar mats or other substitutes for the old thatch within six months, should never have been issued, unless it was certain that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the material for giving obedience to the law.

I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

These and other matters have already been the subject of decrees. Lynch law is one of the first things the Government of a new State should put an end to; the King's first detailed code of laws, therefore, relates to the penal organization and the punishment of offences. This code regulates criminal procedure, and specifies punishment for offences occurring in the relations of Europeans and native races. The Court of Appeal is fixed at Boma, and Courts of first instance will be established at other places as necessity dictates. As regards the composition of the Court, it is made up of a magistrate appointed by the King, and a public prosecutor appointed by the resident Administrator-General. It was not advisable to provide for jury trial in the new State, but in cases involving the penalties of death or penal servitude, assessors will sit on the bench. A list of the leading residents, public servants, officers, and merchants, will be drawn up by the Administrator-General, and assessors will be drawn by lot from this list. In the Courts of first instance two will sit, and in the Court of Appeal four. There will be no difference between them and the magistrate while they are on the bench, the code not distinguishing between the verdict and the sentence, which will be rendered by the majority. If there is an equal division, the prisoner will be acquitted. Both prisoner and public prosecutor can appeal. The decree does not interfere with the native jurisdiction in offences between natives unless a European interest is involved. Thus only in three cases will the natives be amenable to European justice, viz.: 1. Where the offence causes a prejudice to a non-native or the State. 2. Where it is committed in a State establishment, or in the house or establishment of a non-native, or within a kilometre of such establishments. 3. Where it is connected with an offence imputed to a non-native. One of the first acts of the Financial Department has been to lay down the rules governing the acquisition of land in the new State. This is one of the most difficult problems which present themselves in the relations of civilized and non-civilized races. Colonel de Winton considered it so urgent that he issued an ordinance on the subject last July, declaring that no contract or convention with the natives for the occupation of any part of the soil would be recognized by the Government unless made with the intervention of a public officer appointed for the purpose. It also provided that all non-occupied territory belonged to the State, and forbade the dispossession of natives.

Having had the honour of King Sackity\'s friendship, I wish to say that it is the invariable custom, _ab antiquo_, for all kings and chiefs in West Africa to be buried in their houses, and hasty or violent action on the part of the British Government will give great offence, and be resisted by the people in the Protectorates and ""spheres of influence."" I agree that in coast towns in the Colony the extra-mural interment law should be strictly enforced; but in the Protectorate, which extends beyond the Colony into the interior, and includes Croboe, fussy officialism is now doing harm, as the people strongly resent interference in their customs. That Commissioner Williams should have insulted the Croboes by demanding the exhumation of the King\'s body, is a most regrettable proceeding, for a riot would have certainly ensued had he insisted on his imprudent order being carried out. Full inquiry should be made into this matter, as the Croboes are allowed by the Queen to enjoy the privilege of Native courts. Strife and rebellions on the Gold Coast have generally been caused by want of tact and judgment on the part of district commissioners, who exercise wide powers as executive officers, besides sitting as magistrates with civil and criminal jurisdiction, and too frequently alienate the Natives by inconsiderate conduct and haughty bearing. There have, indeed, been some notable exceptions; but the best of the European officials seldom remain long in West African settlements. We still need the guiding hand of the Saxon, and it is the sincere desire of all the Natives that Lord Knutsford will send out wise men of temperate habits and cool judgment to carry on the administration of West Africa with firmness tempered with discretion. Under no circumstances should ""half-breeds"" be employed in responsible positions, for a negro cannot respect a man who insults his black mother and apes the position and habits of his white father, who often disowns him.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

In addition to the riots, the technical staff and labourers on the railway and in the public works department went on strike, demanding the same war bonus paid to the government clerical staff, and complaining of low wages and rising food prices.$^{2}$ In The Gambia, too, rising prices had their social and political effects, leading to sporadic outbursts of looting and petty theft, as well as a seamen's strike for better wages, and to the formation of unions, notably the Gambia Native Defensive Union.\nThe 1921 slump also led to more agitation from West African merchants, a few of whom were financially ruined. The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.602, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African.

They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Trade channels', 'content': ""The southern part of the region with which we are here concerned was, as we have observed, the scene of a desperate struggle by the Asante to control the European trading posts on the coast, which were of crucial importance to its survival: only if it held them could it maintain control of both ends of the trade channel. The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports. Trade in the north was further stimulated by the abolition of the slave trade on the coast, the fact that the routes to the Fante country were closed from time to time, and the political stability of Hausaland and Borno after the djihad led by 'Uthmän dan Fodio. Thus it came about that luxury products from Europe moved down through North Africa, the Fezzän and the Hausa country, or even on occasion up via the Dahomey coast to Kano and onward to the Niger Bend.

In several instances, they overstepped their authority and enslaved their own subjects or neighbours in order to main› tain the flow of wealth and weapons upon which their power rested. The Makua aristocracy pursued such a self-destructive strategy. Until the 1850s the Makua had been the principal exporters of slaves to Mozambique Island. One by-product of their predatory activities was a large-scale migration of the victimized societies. Faced with a diminished labour pool the Makua rulers began raiding each other and enslaving their own subjects in order to maintain the profitable slave trade on which they had become totally dependent. Within two decades the Makua were badly fragmented, leaving them easy prey to subsequent Portuguese invasions.$^{47}$ The AfroPortuguese prazero community exhibited a similar myopic desire for profits which precipitated the rapid demise of the prazo system. As in the case of the Makua chiefs, the prazeros violated their historic charter and began to enslave people living on their lands when they could no longer acquire captives from the interior. In reaction to these excesses the indigenous population either revolted and drove the prazeros off the land or fled into the interior, depriving the estate owner of his traditional source of tribute. The effect, in either case, was the destruction of most prazos by 1830, and those that managed to survive suffered from recurring famines that so debilitated the indigenous population that they proved no match for the attacks of the subsequent decades.

First, the manner in which slaves were procured tended to destroy social and political structures. Social outcasts, offenders against the law, were sold into slavery. A few persons were sold in times of famine or for debt. But the majority of slaves were apparently taken by kidnapping, raiding and wars. The oracle of the Aro is also known to have sold persons it adjudged guilty. But the Aro trade network throughout most of Igboland also obtained many of its slaves through the raids of its mercenary allies, the Abam, Ohaffia, Abiriba, and Edda. Accordingly, the extensive influence exercised by the Aro over Igboland through its oracle did not become an integrative force.$^{9}$ The element of violence inherent in Aro addiction to the slave trade thus distinguished their influence from the earlier ritual influ› ence of the Nri people over wide areas of Igboland.\nIn the economic sphere also, the disruption to normal agricultural activities must have been considerable. In addition, as was the case in the trade between the coastal middlemen and the Europeans, what the Igbo obtained for the slaves taken out was never commensurate with the total loss sustained as a result of the slave trade. Slaves were paid for with salt, fish, spirits, firearms, hats and beads, as well as iron, copper, and brass bars. The metal bars were turned into pewters, ritual bells, state swords, leg-rings, and other ornaments.

It is a positive fact that the instigators were his own brother officers! It is true the natives don’t like Hendick Doyer, but they had no intention of writing against him. The Government chest at St. George d’Elmina has three locks; the Governor, cashier, and commanding officer keep one key each in their possession.

This, the learned counsel observed, was a cowardly act on the part of Mr. Shaw, who, it seemed, was afraid of incurring the responsibility of the detention of the vessel, and the damages he would have had to pay if he had himself put the vessel into court. Mr. Shaw had therefore passed his prize over to Mr. Dunlop, who, being an officer in the English Navy, it was expected that the British Government would back him with English money, which would not have been the case with Mr. Shaw, who was only a colonial officer. But he (Mr. Rainy) would predict that the English Government would do no such thing after they had perused the evidence of Lieutenant Dunlop, which his (Mr. Rainy's) client would bring under the notice of the Lords of the Admiralty. It was a matter of surprise to him (Mr. Rainy) that an old practitioner like Mr. Dougan had advised the seizure of the vessel before perusing the ship's papers, and afterwards arraigned her before this court upon the materials detailed in evidence. He (Mr. Dougan) knew that Mr. Heddle, one of our leading men in this community, and a member of the Legislative Council, was the consignee of the vessel, and yet no application whatever was made by Mr. Dougan to Mr. Heddle for any information about the ship! Was this a proper proceeding? He (Mr. Rainy) could not help remarking that Mr. Dougan had some latent motive for what he had done, and that the evidence showed that as regards Mr. Shaw and Lieutenant Dunlop, that they fully understood each other. The prize was large; if the ship and cargo were condemned, Lieutenant Dunlop would get about 3,000l. for his share, and it therefore became necessary to use any means to condemn the ship. Was this the way to treat the ship of a friendly nation? When these proceedings were published, foreign vessels would keep clear of this port, and the result would be that our trade with foreign countries would receive a severe check. The learned gentleman then read the correspondence that had passed between the owners of the vessel in respect to this very voyage, and Messrs. Frederick Huth and Co., and other eminent London merchants, and the Honourable Charles Heddle of this colony, and challenged the other side to make out anything but a lawful voyage out of the correspondence. Then, with regard to the equipment of the vessel, objected to on the other side, Mr. Rainy said that it had already appeared, and he would be able further to show, that the alleged slave deck was a permanent second deck, built with the ship and referred to in her register. That the empty casks were intended to be filled with palm oil, as appeared by the correspondence and the certificate of the Chamber of Commerce and Arts at Genoa (countersigned by the Customs Authorities there and by the British and French Consuls). Then, as to the boilers, he (Mr. Rainy) would be able to show that instead of being too many they were not enough for the use of the ship. The two guns, eighteen rifles, and eleven small kegs of powder (which would not make two barrels), objected to as articles of slave-trade equipment, were so ridiculous that he did not consider them worthy of serious notice. The learned gentleman concluded by protesting against the conduct of Lieut. Dunlop in going on board the ship with armed sailors, seizing her, and illegally keeping armed men on board the ship for eight days without any authority from the civil power. The ship was seized on the 3rd August by Lieut. Dunlop, who did so according to his own evidence, without having seen any of the ship's papers. He did not then put the ship into Court at once, or ask the aid of the civil authorities in the matter, but continued on board with armed men until the 11th August, when this Court first heard of the seizure. The proceedings of this young officer, he (the learned Counsel) hoped, would be seriously dealt with by his official superiors when they were laid before them.

We can afford to be stigmatised and abused by agents of corruption everywhere, while we continue to see from time to time substantial fruits of our advocacy of what is decent and just and true. We thought it to be impossible that our exposure in our number for November last of the scandalous and unjustifiable seizure and confiscation at Lagos of 3,752 cases of gin, following as it did on the track of the revelation by Mr. Rainy, in 1866, of the Sierra Leone customs seizures in the time of Governor Blackall, could remain barren of results. The whole history both of the customs seizures and confiscation at Sierra Leone, condemned by the Privy Council in England, and the above-mentioned seizure and confiscation at Lagos, set aside, after unjustifiable delays, by the Duke of Buckingham, pointed so undesirably to the participation of governors and collectors of customs in the produce of seizures, as the evil root from which those acts of abominable injustice directly sprang, that the Colonial-office could not need further illumination on the subject. An alteration in the law was inevitable; and we thank the Colonial-office for having now directed the passing of local ordinances at Sierra Leone and elsewhere on the West Coast to effect the desirable change. Governors are no longer to participate in the results of customs seizures. The Ordinance or Bill submitted to the Legislative Council at Sierra Leone, in order to its being passed through the requisite stages to become law, is entitled, ""An Ordinance to abolish the present application of penalties and forfeitures under the Customs Laws, Ordinances, and Regulations, and to make other provisions in lieu thereof."" Under the vicious laws hitherto in force—which, however, found an advocate and admirer in Colonel Yonge (at present commanding the troops at Sierra Leone, and by virtue of such office a member of the Legislative Council)—the proceeds of seizures were divided equally, one third to each, between the governor or lieutenant-governor, the collector of customs, and to the seizer or informer. Under the new Ordinance, the nett proceeds are to be passed to the credit of the revenue; a power being reserved to the governor to award a portion not exceeding one third, in such proportion as he may direct, to any person or persons ""who may have seized, informed, or sued for the same."" We shall never again hear of such seizures as those at Sierra Leone under Governor Blackall and Mr. Shaw, or at Lagos under Administrator Glover and his Collector of Customs. But there is one question that we feel bound in justice to ask. Since Her Majesty\'s Government have thus condemned the law which they had formerly directed to be passed in those colonies, and which they allowed to remain in force notwithstanding that the inevitable iniquity of such law was clearly pointed out, ought they not, in common honesty and justice, to repay to the revenues of Sierra Leone all those heavy costs and charges—amounting, we believe, to between 3,000l. and 4,000l.—in which Mr. Shaw, the Collector of Customs, was condemned by the Privy Council, under the able pleading of Mr. Rainy, and which they allowed Governor Blackall most iniquitously to pay for him out of the revenues of the colony;—and again, to Mr. Regis, the amount of loss and damage and costs sustained and paid by him in and through the before-mentioned Lagos seizure, and which amounted, we believe, to nearly 1,000l.? Whatever may be done as regards recouping the revenue of Sierra Leone, we hope that for the honour of the country they will not allow a foreigner, which Mr. Regis is, thus to suffer under a law which was a disgrace to a civilised country in the present age, and which Her Majesty\'s Government have found it to be their duty now to repeal.

A Government messenger proved the act of abstraction. The results of the inquiry have been forwarded to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone, for his decision, but it is rumoured that influence will be used at Sierra Leone to ""square"" his Excellency, and have the matter hushed up. If a *civilian* stole a letter, he would be prosecuted; with an official in a responsible position, it is a very venial *fault*. There were several other charges against Mr. Lewis, nearly as serious, not properly gone into; one of which was that when, during Mr. Johnston\'s absence, a Board was held to examine the affairs of his office—such Board consisting of the Governor, the Collector of Customs, the Colonial Surgeon, and Mr. Lewis—when they assembled in the Treasury Office, Mr. Lewis took the key of the safe from the Governor, and opened it, took a bundle of documents out of it, took this bundle into his own office and secreted it, and then returned to the other members of the Board; afterwards, when these papers were asked for, they could not be produced; yet these documents mostly referred to the money at various times borrowed by Mr. Lewis from Mr. Johnston to cover the deficits in the monthly official accounts of Mr. Lewis. His carrying on large trading operations was not touched on; and it is curious that he has not been suspended from office, though there are other officers competent to take his place; but, then, he is ""such a valuable officer.""\n\nAnother curious case: there is a large quantity of damaged tobacco lying in the yard behind the Court House, in custody of the Custom House. One of the policemen on sentry duty in the yard stole a quantity of it; he was detected, and instead of being\n[August 1, 1882.]\n\nprosecuted, was given _seven_ days\' ""cells"" by the police authorities, and then returned to duty in the ranks.

It is stated that the prisoners—both debtor and criminal (and all seem to us, by the account given, to be huddled together)—are always intending to report him to the Commandant; but that the Commandant had not, when our informant wrote, made any visit of inspection to the gaol for above two and a-half months. This is said to have given such a feeling of irresponsibility to the gaoler, that he has greatly abused his position, ordering and, above all, permitting things which reflect great disgrace on the authorities. Among other things, the water seems to be brought by convicts from Usher Fort for the supply of the prisoners; and the supply which ought to be for the use of the prisoners, is given away to friends of the gaoler, while the debtors and criminal prisoners are dying with thirst. The debtor prisoners, it is said, cannot get water to drink from the Government tank, but it has to be purchased by or for them, the charge being one shilling for a pot of good water and threepence for blackish; and that, as it is impossible they should continue to be thus supplied, either at their own expense or that of their creditors, it may be expected that they will, many of them, really perish through want of water, as they cannot, moreover, get any with which to wash themselves, which will certainly tend rapidly to loathsome sickness and death. Our informant asks whether, under the law of imprisonment for debt, it is intended that the debtors shall be brought into the gaol to be killed; or whether they are supposed to be lodged there in order to induce them to pay their debts? Criminal prisoners, who may be able to pay in money or rum, are further stated to be allowed the most shamefully licentious indulgencies. We must say that if a tithe of what our informant writes—details of which we cannot possibly give—be true, the negligence of the superior authorities has led to most cruel and disgraceful evils, which call for immediate action on the part of the Commandant; or, if he continue to neglect his duty in this respect, on the part of the Governor, Captain Strahan, who, as we have understood, effected a great reform in the Gaol of Lagos by his visits to that establishment and the abuses he there corrected.

At Salt Pond, a clerk robbed his master to a large amount. On being threatened imprisonment, he went to the District Commissioner and reported that his master had been swindling the Government to a very large extent. He was called up, and could not deny the charge. Most of the stores of the other merchants were searched. Captain ——, an American, who had been landing a large quantity of rum and tobacco, was called upon to deliver a list of his exports, and it was discovered that six of the native traders had smuggled a large quantity of articles subject to duty into the town. The examining officer being at the time at Salt Pond, the detection was complete. Still worse cases are reported from Winnebah, where the local attorneys have all been engaged to defend the culprits. It is computed that at least, during the last nine months, the Government has lost about 8,000/. through smuggling. The question arises, How is this to be avoided? Either the Government must place a port officer on board of each of the rum and tobacco vessels as they enter the port until those articles have been sold out, or active district commissioners must be appointed at Winnebah and other places to watch the interest of the Government, as in most of these cases of smuggling the port officers or landing-waiters are more or less implicated.—Yours, &c.,\n\n---\n\n**THE SLAVE-TRADE IN LAGOS: EFFECT PRODUCED BY LETTER IN THE AFRICAN TIMES (OCTOBER).**  \n**TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.**  \nLagos, Nov. 10, 1876.\n\nDear Sir,—Touched to the quick by the grave evil into which our authorities have fallen in dealing with that all-important subject about which you took the trouble to publish my poor letter in your October number, and being humbly sure of your philanthropic indulgence and assistance to every friend of truth, freedom, and justice, and, according to your paper\'s motto, to every colonist who suffers from injustice, your humble servant cannot help but importune you so soon, in order that you may kindly strike while the ""iron is hot,"" call the attention of Downing-street, and every Africa\'s friend in England and elsewhere, to this ""dire eclipse,"" and use the means you may think proper in demolishing this stronghold of our antagonist, the devil.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-11-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1877#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Disgraceful State of the Roads and European Cemetery at Accra—Poor Captain Crozier's Grave!"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Mr. Simpson, our Acting Administrator, has caused the erection of a wharf and landing-place at Accra, which everyone arriving here admits is the most creditable and useful public work on the Gold Coast.

The streets of Accra are not only places where all kinds of rubbish and filth are cast daily, but they are also used by the juvenile portion of the inhabitants as privies. Were it not for the pigs that are permitted to roam at large in our streets in the capacity of scavengers, I really do not know what we should do. It is a matter of astonishment that the filthy condition in which the authorities permit the streets to continue has not already produced cholera or some other dire epidemic. The roads leading from the town, especially the carriage-roads in the immediate neighbourhood of Jamestown, are rendered impassable, partly by reason of being overgrown with prickly pears, and partly in consequence of deep pits having been dug in various places. On the occasion of the funeral of the late Mr. Irvine, the procession was compelled to make a considerable detour in order to avoid a deep pit dug almost in front of the cemetery. As for the cemetery itself, it is a standing disgrace to the Christian community of Accra, more especially the Government and the European residents. I walked to the cemetery a few days ago for the purpose of making an inspection of its actual condition. I found that there was no gate to it, nor anything to obstruct the entrance of the pigs, a herd of which were engaged in making geological researches amongst the graves. Most of the graves had been so interfered with by the swine that they had sunk some feet, and the coffins in a few were exposed to view. The grave of a late Civil Commandant of Accra, Capt. William Crozier, was in the most dilapidated and disgraceful condition of all. There was nothing at all to mark the spot that contained the remains of so respected and important a public functionary; there was not a stone even over it, and it had sunk some three feet. The day after my visit to the place the sum of fifty dollars was raised by subscription amongst the native and European residents of Accra for the purpose of putting poor Crozier\'s grave in a decent state of repair, and placing a stone with an inscription over. Surely the authorities might spare a few pounds for these purposes before taking away eight thousand dollars from us to squander in another district.

The Party employed the usual methods to achieve its aims - participating in elections in Lagos which it won in 1923, 1928 and 1933, holding mass meetings and sending deputations to the governor as it did in 1930 'to discuss such national matters as the trade depression and the appointment and deposition of chiefs'.$^{6}$ This party dominated the politics of Lagos until its defeat by the Nigerian Youth Movement in the Lagos elections of 1938."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Instead, colonial authorities concentrated on consolidating their control and exploiting the human and material resources of their colonies. The absorbing problem was the solution to Europe's post-war problems of rehabilitation of the economy and the services. However, the international environment, with its streaks of liberalism being expressed on colonialism and colonial affairs,$^{5}$ made a change of attitude inevitable in the long run.\nBut colonialism did not affect only the educated elite and the traditional rulers. To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Youth Leagues and Movements', 'content': 'Such certainly were the demands made by the Gold Coast Youth Con› ference at its first meeting in Accra organized by Danquah in 1929.\nThe demands made by the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM) were similar.

The NYM Charter also demanded universal suffrage, criticized both the practice of Indirect Rule and the representation of European commercial and economic interests in the legislative council, and pressed for the gradual Nigerianization of the civil service. In the economic sphere, like the Gold Coast Youth Conference, it called for equal African participation in the economy. It even provided the outline of a five-year development plan, in which priority would be given to manufacturing, banking, textiles and transport. It also proposed to set up co-operative societies which would help Nigerians buy up some industries; agricultural banks were also to be established to help modernize agriculture and improve the standard of living of the peasantry. It condemned the monopoly of extra-territorial firms, and urged the introduction of social welfare programmes for the benefit of Nigerian workers.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""With the establishment of European administration, chiefs were manipulated as if they were administrative personnel who might be reposted or removed to satisfy colonial needs.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Unable to accept the excesses of the Christian cultural imperialism such as the embargo on African instruments and tunes in a 'universal' Church, the breakaway movements began. From 1882 to the early 1930s a proliferation of secessionist movements took place mostly inspired by a need to worship God in the cultural mode of their fore› fathers. 1 $^{9}$ And now commenced also a unique 'operatic' tradition in West Africa, but especially Lagos, beginning with church cantatas and moving to the dramatization of biblical stories until it asserted its independence in secular stories and the development of professional touring troupes.

From the general concerts of classical music and English folk songs by the 'Academy' of the 1880s to the historical play King Elejigbo of the Egbe Ife Church Dramatic Society in 1902, a transformation of thought and sensibility had recognizably taken place even among the Westernized elite of Southern Nigeria. The Church did not take kindly to it. It closed its churchyards and schools to the evolving art. Alas, it only succeeded in accelerating the defiant erection of theatre halls, specifically designed for the performing arts. It was in reality a tussle between groups of colonial elites, fairly balanced in the matter of resources. By 1912 the secularization of theatrical entertainment was sufficiently complete for the colonial ad› ministration of Lagos to gazette a 'Theatre and Public Performance Regulations Ordinance' which required that performing groups obtain a licence before going before the public. In the climate of cultural nationalism which obtained in Lagos at that time, it is doubtful whether this ruse at political censorship would have worked; it is significant that the ordinance was never enacted."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In Sierra Leone, the frustration of the educated classes and the African traders, and the unemployed in the big towns was given open expression in the riots of 1919 in which protests against the price of rice took the form of attacks on Syrian and Lebanese traders, and in the workers' strike that same year.

In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in West Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'Politics and nationalism in British West Africa > Rural politics or rural mass nationalism in the inter-war period', 'content': ""In this document, fees and fines being imposed by the traditional rulers were reduced and regulations for their imposition were laid down; the Okwahuman Council was also to be made a truly representative body of chiefs and commoners and failure to attend was to be made punishable by fine.

Between 1910 and 1944, there were at least thirty-three depositions of divisional chiefs in Akyem Abuakwa alone.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

Consequently the amir was chosen not for any inherited quality of sacredness but for his personal piety towards Allah.

Another powerful argument in support of this is as follows: The settlement of Lagos, although called the youngest of the settlements, has superior advantages over the other settlements. It has become a self-supporting settlement, without the cost of a penny to the British Government for the last few years. Although the settlement is only ten years old from the date of the cession, its revenue is no less than 50,000l. a-year, collected from a very moderate customs tariff; a revenue which is sufficient for carrying out its own government, and might leave a yearly surplus revenue to meet any emergency, were it only controlled by the people. The settlement is surrounded by tribes who are by far more intelligent, energetic, and enterprising than most of the West Coast tribes, and who have their own regularly-organised native governments with strong native military organisation (especially the Egba, Yoruba, and Jebu tribes), being able to march out at any time an army of 20,000 to 60,000 fighting men.

If necessary, I can adduce proof that, since the creation of this central government, the chiefs of the surrounding countries have ceased to look up to the administrator in the same light of respect as the Queen's representative as they did in former times, consequently the prestige and influence of this government has become much more weak and impotent since 1866 than it was and would otherwise have continued to be. The prosperity of this settlement, and the rapid progress of civilisation and Christianity in this country, depend very much upon the free action of this Government; and any such action is entirely impotent in the eyes of the surrounding chiefs, so long as the head of the executive continues to be (as the native chiefs call it) a boy or subordinate of the Queen's representative at Sierra Leone."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Official Correspondence on the Affairs of Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I have not before me the Ordinance of 11th March, 1871, which is repealed by that of the 11th September, 1871, and cannot, therefore, by comparing the two, arrive at any idea of the reasons which may have been alleged by the Administrator of Lagos to induce your lordship to sanction the repeal of the one Ordinance and order the enactment of the other; but my correspondents in Lagos, who are alarmed by the substitution of the new Ordinance for the old one, have evidently not found in such comparison, which they have without doubt been enabled to make, anything calculated to remove those apprehensions which the hasty passing of this new Ordinance and subsequent Acts of their Administrator had otherwise caused. I cannot, therefore, specify, with so much distinctness as I could desire, the full grounds on which the merchants and traders of Lagos base their apprehensions. Some of these may, however, be found in the list of grievances stated against the Government of Lagos by the King of Jebu Ode. The territories of this King commence at the mainland shore near Lagos, and extend thence in the direction of Ibadan. Until lately, the messages of the Administrator at Lagos to this King, asking free access through his territories for all goods, &c., to and from Ibadan, were in language of command and dictation, which the King resented by sending back the messengers without granting them any audience.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1872#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lagos and its Affairs—Captain Strachan and Captain Glover', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We shall be sorry indeed to find that the Colonial-office has made another mistake in the appointment of Captain Strachan to the Administratorship of Lagos.

During the interview of the commercial deputation with Earl Kimberley in May last, his lordship spoke so confidently as to the merits of Captain Strachan, who might be regarded ""as almost a civilian,"" that we expected to hear of a courteous, confidence-inspiring Administrator installed in his person within the walls of the Government-house at Lagos. We regret, however, that it should be our duty to state that the first impressions at Lagos have not been favourable as regards the new Administrator. If the description came to us from one quarter only, we should have taken no public notice of it; but it comes to us from several and distinct ones; and what we gather is, that his tone is not at all a soothing one; his bearing is lofty, for Africa, and frightens even Europeans away from Government-house. We cannot help feeling that this is a bad beginning. His predecessor, Mr. Berkeley, the present Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, gained golden opinions of all in Lagos; he was beloved there; and we never heard that the public service was thereby injured, or the Queen\'s government thereby lowered in the estimation of Europeans or natives. It would be, indeed, lamentable should Colonel Strachan undo what Mr. Berkeley effected; nor do we hesitate to say that such a result would put an end at once and for ever to the system of appointing naval and military men as Administrators of commercial settlements—a system which was, with so much reason, denounced by the deputation, to whose interview with Earl Kimberley we have before alluded.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN UNRIVALLED POLICE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'of preserving public order and repressing crime), what is wanting is a real effective working police, under one qualified head, and a constant watchful supervision by the Administrator. Surely a sweeping, thorough, and economical reform will follow close upon this exposé. No one can possibly justify the continuance of so discreditable a state of things, accompanied with a waste of public money, that is so greatly wanted for useful purposes. If we are not misinformed, not only are sanitary improvements urgently needed, but Government House itself wants rebuilding, being now a notoriously unhealthy place; there are more streets to be opened; the Customs Pier is in such bad repair as to have become dangerous to both life and property; more street lamps are required, and these lights should not be extinguished until a later hour than at present. There is manifestly no place in Lagos just now for police inspectors, glorious in patent leather boots, with button-hole bouquets and cigars in mouth, exhibiting themselves and their horses curvetting at disreputable doors. How anything so disgraceful can have been tolerated at all, we cannot possibly conceive; but we are at least certain that if the local authority is not equal of itself to the task of cleansing this very small though filthy Augean stable, Downing-street will give it help in the work.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1878#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN UNRIVALLED POLICE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If it were not that life and property are endangered, and British rule disgraced by such a state of things as that described by our correspondents, ""The Merchants and Traders of Lagos,"" there really is matter in that description so extravagantly ridiculous, that it would be difficult to write seriously about the Lagos Police Force. What sort of administration of government that can be, which remains apathetically indifferent in presence of a police thus organized or disorganized, is what we cannot understand. We suppose a regular Police force is necessary in Lagos, though we should have been inclined to fancy that a constabulary, with night police, on the old English plan, would have been in very many respects better, as helping to educate the responsible people in the place in the working of free institutions. A Police system, as we understand and have applied it in Great Britain, is a necessary attendant on large and dense populations and advanced civilization, but does not appear to us to be necessary where the conditions of population are such as in Lagos—in which place it seems not to have had any other public utility than to assist the authorities in squandering the public revenues. Three European inspectors and three native inspectors mounted, and with horse allowance of some 45l. a-year each, in addition to salaries scandalously large in comparison with any duties they could possibly have to perform, in a place where the educated population may be counted on one\'s fingers! It would have been bad enough if these men were merely respectable well-behaved nonentities, setting good moral and social example, while depleting the overgorged treasury; but when we look at them in the light in which they are exhibited to us by our correspondents, the matter becomes so much the worse, that, to use the words of one of them in a private letter, ""it is a deplorable scandal, disgraceful to every one connected with it."" ""The cry is great,"" he continues, ""and I ought to state very much more than I have done; but I forbear for decency sake."" We think we see these gentlemen inspectors in ""patent leather boots, with bouquet in button-hole of Oxford or cut-away coat, and cigar in mouth, parading about on horseback, with an attendant policeman as orderly, to hold their horses while they are passing their time with their frail female friends."" If on no other ground than this, that useful reformer, Governor Pope Hennessy, wisely performed his duty when he knocked off all these attendant orderlies in 1872, as we are informed he did; although the inspectors have since ""quietly and cunningly, one by one, resumed them—at the public expense of course—and dare to use them, too, for all their own private work and purposes."" Another correspondent, writing on the same subject, says: ""If they must have horses, and grooms to walk about after them to hold those horses, let these be their own grooms, and not policemen. A groom\'s pay, with a grass man and corn expenses, are only about 2l. a month; and the horse allowance being 3l. 17s. 6d. per month, they could even then make a large profit on it."" We, for our part, do not believe in any necessity for this mounted police; but if some be indispensable, certainly Lagos cannot want more than two of them.

So far good. It would have been an outrage on official propriety as well as upon public feeling, had a contrary decision been arrived at in the Colonial-office. Taking advantage, as we have before shown, of a grievous error of Earl Kimberley, who supposed that the war troubles in the Oil rivers might be checked by prohibiting the export of arms from Lagos; and employing the ordinance he was instructed to publish with this object, to the furtherance of his hostile feelings and views against the Egba, Ijebu, and Porto Novo authorities and people, he has brought a cloud of trouble over trading Lagos that will be felt, and remembered with pain and sorrow, long after it shall have passed away. Captain Glover is removed, he is not to be again thrust upon a settlement he has so grievously injured by his late and former political proceedings. But, as we asked last month, who is to pay the losses that have been sustained by his really unjustifiable acts? The ordinary course of trading has been suspended for above four months; which has given an opportunity and occasion for the strong to oppress and plunder the weak; ships, chartered from England to bring home cargoes of produce from Lagos, which would have been forthcoming in the ordinary course of trade, found themselves at a port where no produce was to be got; and had either to be kept on week after week at heavy demurrage, or to leave without cargoes, or only partially loaded. Fifteen or twenty ships at one time have been waiting outside the bar of Lagos thus circumstanced. Who is to pay for all this? Merchants and traders are, of course, to be the victims, and to pay for the grievous errors and delinquencies of great and small officials; a Secretary of State, and the Administrator of the settlement! The evils caused have taken too great a variety of shapes to be fully exposed. But among many there is one we feel bound to notice. Official error and delinquency stop the healthy current of trade and commerce; traders can no longer get any produce from their debtors, the native barterers; no matter what amount of resources of this kind they may be possessed of, they are for the time being placed in the position of not being able to obtain a farthing from any of them. What then? Lagos is a British settlement, and the course of law cannot be in any way interfered with. The governing power keeps every trader\'s till empty, but the governing power does not, therefore, say, ""There shall be no action for debt, no proceedings for unfulfilled contracts and obligations, which I, the governing power, have made it impossible to pay or fulfil."" Under these circumstances, the agents of European houses, with whom almost all native traders and merchants have relations, put the screw on these latter wherever they see that a gain may be made, or a grudge be gratified. The courts issue decrees and sign judgments against real or supposed debtors, just as if trade or commerce were pursuing their regular course; and the property and goods of the native merchant and trader (there being no native purchasers at a time of trade suspension) are sacrificed, or we may truly say plundered under due form of law. We fear that Lagos could show a large amount of oppression and wrong thus exercised and endured. And what remedy have the plundered and oppressed? None whatever. The Secretary of State receives his official, salary, and cannot have done or caused wrong. The removed Administrator gets another appointment; he has committed an error or done wrong, but he has been in other respects a good public servant. The legal authorities not having had the action of their courts and of the law suspended by Government order, are bound to hear complaints and give decisions regardless of the unnecessary ruin they may cause. Officially, no arrangements can be better; and this is the best of all possible worlds; while for those who are oppressed, plundered, and ruined through their error or wrong-doing, or mechanical action unsuited to such a state of events, there is nothing left but unavailing complaints and irretrievable loss. They have been ruined by political events, and there is an end of it; the official theory being that no merchant or trader has any cause of complaint for loss or wrong he may endure in consequence of the political acts of his rulers. Officialism rather expects that the crushed one should be satisfied to be thus crushed, like the fanatic Hindoo under the wheel of Juggernaut. But our West Coast friends, the scholars of British missionaries or educated in England, and imbued with English ideas, are not Hindoos; and have none of the Hindoo Juggernaut reverence for the political wheel that may have ground them in the dust. And we utter their complaints in their name, because they are just and reasonable; and because, moreover, we hold it as a point of moral right that wherever erring political action, which he could not foresee or resist, inflicts wrong on a subject, he is entitled to compensation from some source or other, since he could not obtain protection. The ordinance for prohibiting the exportation of arms, ordered to be passed and proclaimed by Earl Kimberley, was a mischievous ordinance, founded on grievous ignorance such as it was impossible that any man trading under British rule and protection, could have conceived that a British Secretary of State could be capable of. The action of the late Administrator of Lagos, under that ordinance which he had been instructed to get passed by his Council with a specific object, in turning that ordinance into unpardonable hostility against the surrounding native nations and peoples, was action which the men thus trading vainly protested against, but had no power to control; there was no possible imperial object of advantage to be obtained by the application of that ordinance, as it was applied by Administrator Glover; and we do therefore maintain, in the interests of right against wrong, and of the weak against the strong, that every penny of loss, which it could be proved has been caused directly or indirectly by that ordinance so applied, ought to be paid either by Secretary of State, Administrator, or the Imperial Treasury. We say the Imperial Treasury, and not the Treasury of the settlement, because the passing of that ordinance was not at the instance of the Administrator of the settlement, but was a direct Imperial command; and ordered, not for objects connected with that settlement, but for supposed Imperial views and objects in the Oil rivers—places with which the Settlement of Lagos has nothing whatever to do. We have had but too much experience of the almost hopelessness of obtaining justice from Government, when they deny it, through action in the House of Commons; but we shall nevertheless endeavour to instigate a discussion next session on the very important point involved in the late Imperial and local governmental action as regards Lagos, and the grievous individual loss and wrong thereby directly and indirectly inflicted. Unhappily, too, the evil had not yet become altogether of the past when the last mail left Lagos. The Governor-in-Chief had done all that could be done on the British side to induce the native authorities on the mainland to re-open roads and markets for the trade-supply of Lagos. But those native authorities stand very much on their dignity, and could not be expected to rush at once into the British official arms with expansive affection. And therefore the markets were still unsupplied. Ships were still waiting in vain for produce; and although hope was reasonably enough now in the ascendant, and a happy change of position, from ruinous stagnation to a profitable activity, was daily and hourly expected, the settlement and its merchants and traders were still suffering from the unjustifiable political course pursued by the late Administrator Glover, who, as an offset to having', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS AFFAIRS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Again our hopes have been disappointed. Another month, with the year 1873 also close upon us, without any news of the actual re-opening of trade at Lagos. Month after month brings us a repetition of the same hopes and beliefs—a repetition of the same disappointments. Where is all this to end? When are the reasonable hopes of the merchant and trader, based on an estimate of human wants and desires, to be fulfilled? Alas! we know not. Had the British policy at Lagos been a reasonable one, the native people around would have been encouraged, long ere this, to appoint someone to represent them in England—to make known their complaints and desires, and to seek satisfaction for them—instead of resorting to the barbarous system of cutting off communications, and annihilating trade, to the loss and inconvenience of their own people, as well as those of the Government with which they disagree. But, unfortunately, the British Executive in Lagos has been accustomed to represent itself to the native countries around as so immediately deriving its power from the Queen of Great Britain, and so essentially reflecting the feelings and views of the Queen respecting them, that any attempt on their part to appeal against its decisions and acts would be altogether vain and fruitless. Hence it has come to pass that, instead of referring to the British Government in England against the injurious acts and hostile policy, and aggrandising encroachments, of the local British authority, they have, to the great injury of themselves as well as of the traders of Lagos, met the injurious acts of the Lagos Executive with reprisals, and closed their roads and markets against us. What is to be done under these circumstances? The British Government either desire territorial aggrandisement for the Colony of Lagos, or they do not. They either wish that Lagos should be a territorially expanding colony, with all the necessary commitments as regards Imperial expenditure, or they do not. If they do not, nothing can be more easy than to give such assurances, and make such changes, as shall convince the Egbas and Jebus that there is not only no desire on the part of the British Government that Lagos should usurp power and dominion over them, and wrest from them their territory, but that they are entirely opposed thereto, and look upon Lagos solely as a commercial colony, the only conquests of which are to be those of trade and commerce—a promotion of the material development of their countries, and the spread of civiliza...', 'last_edit_date': '1872-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS AFFAIRS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We cannot say what may be the news now on its way to England from Lagos. We cannot defer the preparations for our paper until the day of its publication, and are therefore under the necessity of commenting on what is known to us at the time we write. We hope, and have reason to believe, that before our present number goes to press, we shall have received the long desired intelligence of the difficulties with Egbas, Jebus, and others being all removed; and of the long desolate markets of Lagos overflowing with produce. We have not any such news at present; but what we have, affords additional proof of the heavy responsibility that rests upon all concerned in the Government of a trading British settlement or colony, when they, through ignorance or malice, pursue a course which is calculated to bring on a commercial paralysis. By inexcusable ignorance on the part of a Secretary of State, and the very wantonness of official evil on the part of an Administrator, the trade and commerce of Lagos was arrested in its course on the 18th of March last. The authorities of the native interior countries from which Lagos draws its commercial supplies, had been goaded by repeated and incessant insults and wrongs, into a condition of mind which led them to refuse all further trading intercourse, until the official author of those insults and wrongs should be removed from the office which gave him power thus to outrage them and their people. At the first glance it would have seemed as if trade would be immediately resumed, from the moment such removal were made, and the obnoxious measures repealed and abolished; and we must confess that, although our knowledge of African thought and action is derived from the varied experience of many years, we fell into the error of believing that such would be the case in this instance. We thought the Egba authorities and the King of Jebu, knowing as they did that the grievances of which they had so much reason to complain were the unhealthy spawn of one diseased official mind alone—that the quarrel really was between them and the late Administrator of Lagos only, and not really between them and Great Britain, would have hastened to show their satisfaction at the removal of their official enemy from his post and power, and have at once set free the fettered hands of commerce. It has not been so. Captain Glover was sent away from Lagos by Mr. Pope Hennessey, on the 15th June—and all obnoxious decrees, irritating and injurious to the Egbas and others, were at the same time repealed; but yet, up to the 6th August at least, the Egbas and Jebus had not removed their interdict on trade. The venom was still rankling in the veins of those who had been stung, and a sense of offended dignity prevented the due consideration of the evils resulting to their own subjects and territories, as well as to Lagos and its traders, from the prohibition to export that produce on which the wealth and progress of both the one and the other depend. Lagos and its native traders and merchants especially have been thus doomed to a prolonged continuance of those evils to which we briefly alluded in our last; and in the paralysis of all available means for paying debts and obligations, the law—British law—has handed the unfortunate fish to the greedy cormorants who are ever ready to seek their unjust gains among the necessities of their fellow-men. British officials spear the fish—British magistrates net them—and British cormorants devour them. We feel it to be our duty, therefore, to repeat the protest we made in our last, against the uninterrupted action of commercial law, through British legal authorities and tribunals, at periods when the British governing power has chosen for its own ends, or in its own ignorance or wickedness, to cut off from the trading masses of the community, those means by which alone they could be enabled to meet their commercial engagements. During the perturbation caused by the late French and German war—during the siege of Paris, and the reign of the Commune, and for some time after, no creditor was allowed to put the machinery of law at work in France, for the enforcement of civil contracts, to despoil and ruin his fellow-citizen. And thus it ought to have been in Lagos during this suspension of trade, which resulted entirely from acts of Government, and not from any acts or errors of individual traders, or from any cause which any one individual of the trading community, or the whole body of them combined, could suspend or control. They did what they could by remonstrance, by petition, by communication to the Home authorities, and through the African Times; and having done this, they are none of them morally, however they may be made legally, responsible for the results against which they petitioned and remonstrated. We do not need any spirit to come from the other world to tell us that these remarks of ours will not produce the effects they ought to produce. The duty of a public writer is not limited by the extent of his power to procure the justice to which he may establish a claim. It is his duty to hold aloft the lamp of truth, and leave the results of his so doing to others. It is at least a consolation to victims, if the light thus diffused, shall enable every observer to see that the wheels which are crushing the poor victims of commercial misgovernment, are official ones; that they have not voluntarily thrown themselves under them with suicidal intent, but have been thrust under them by an erring Secretary of State, and the malicious wantonness of official power in his delegate, to whom the victim was bound to yield unresistingly. The light thus diffused may, and often does, serve also to prevent the recurrence of errors and wickedness of a similar kind, and thus gradually helps on changes which conduce to an enlarged general security against the errors and aberration of constituted authorities.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1872#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN GLOVER v.

It is, perhaps, ungrateful in us to write thus of one who has lately paid us a very high compliment. We felt it to be our duty, during the month of December last, to bring Captain Glover and the course he was then pursuing at Lagos, to the great disturbance of the public mind, under the special notice of Earl Kimberley. The correspondence appears in our January number. In reply to our representation relative to the ""prohibition of the export of arms ordinance,"" his lordship informed us that the said ordinance was passed by the Lagos Council in pursuance of his lordship\'s instructions. Copies of these letters, it would seem, were sent off to Lagos by the Colonial-office, and Captain Glover did us the honour to print them and placard them in Lagos (at the public expense, of course), and even to send copies of them to some of our best known friends, thus anticipating the publication of them in the African Times (cide letter, p. 119). It would have been difficult for the Administrator of Lagos to have given a more convincing proof of the importance, in his estimation, of our intervention in Lagos affairs. We for a long time abstained from any such intervention, except to praise Captain Glover for certain sanitary and other measures calculated to improve Lagos. We knew but too well, from occasional indications, that the old disease was still in the Administrator\'s mind, and that the long enjoyment of uncontrolled power in Lagos was making him imperious and arbitrary. It was only, however, when the said disease came once more to a head, and even some of his most devoted admirers were filled with alarm and apprehension, that we felt it to be an imperative duty on our part to interfere; and that interference, we believe, will not be without fruit—aye, and good fruit too. Captain Glover\'s policy, or rather impolicy, dangerous and full of the elements of destruction, will not bear the official and public scrutiny to which we are subjecting it. The strong light of truth which we direct upon it will show it in all its criminal error; for such administrative errors are criminal. There cannot be any such secrecy in the political relations of Lagos with the adjoining countries—a commercial emporium, with its sale and supply markets—that a grave complication, justifying such measures as we have referred to the consideration of Earl Kimberley should exist without the merchants and traders of Lagos knowing all about it. So far as our information extends—and its sources are many and reliable—no merchant or trader at Lagos whose opinion is worth a moment\'s regard, can find any complication to justify them. If it exists, therefore, it must be that it is the creation of the Governor\'s own mind, or has been created expressly for his mind by the wretched flatterers who surround him, and have fastened themselves by his favour, like birds of prey, upon the revenues of Lagos. The propaganda of trade and civilization from Lagos must be an entirely pacific and conciliatory one, if it is to have any success; and such distribution in hot haste of 1,000 muskets, as is described in the letter above referred to, is neither pacific nor conciliatory; but, on the contrary, an insane, wasteful, and dangerous expenditure of Colonial revenue, that cannot be too strongly condemned. As we know, however, that our counsel has weight with the Egbas, we venture to express the hope that they will shame the intemperate folly of the Administrator of Lagos, by their wisdom and patience. They have only to wait a short time; and, in the natural course of events, a beneficial change will assuredly come—a change that will establish the peaceful relations of Lagos with all the interior countries, and, above all, with Abeokuta, upon a firm and sure foundation.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1872#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE POLICE OF LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Just a few words about the Lagos Police, and the manner in which its operations are guided by the Government. This is a subject of great importance, especially when it is considered that it must be mainly owing to the exertions of a police, under judicious and well-defined regulations, that crimes can be brought to the notice of the authorities and punished. In the absence of such regulations, the name and office of police are mere mockeries. We deeply regret, then, to state that, literally speaking, there is not a single written rule for the guidance of the Lagos police. Some time in 1869 a few directions were put in writing by the then Superintendent, but it is believed these were mere private memoranda for his own guidance, for they were neither signed by him nor sanctioned by the then Administrator; consequently, the succeeding Superintendents have never been able safely to use them as official. Further, not even when peculiar exigencies in the colony need special rules for their treatment, do the police have these supplied to them. This state of things greatly hinders the efficient working of the police scheme in Lagos, and has many a time put matters in great confusion—e.g., when your October issue appeared with a letter condemning the apathy of the Lagos Government on the question of domestic slavery in Lagos, carried on under the Administrator\'s very nose, general orders were issued from Government House for the police to be on the alert to bring slave-dealers to justice. There being no special rule as to how this was to be done, or on what grounds the police were to apprehend people, or how they were to prosecute them, and nine-tenths of them being illiterate men, great confusion took place. The Administrator himself was at a loss how to manage to get certain arrested parties convicted, without incurring the displeasure of his friend and confidante, Chief (?) Taiwo; and the Acting Stipendiary Magistrate (Mr. C. D. Turton) and the Superintendent of Police were threatened by one Monsieur Callamand with a law-suit if they did not prove against him the charge of slave-dealing, for which he had been summoned to the Police-court. All these things prove the absolute necessity there exists for established rules to guide the police in their action; for, had there been such, his Excellency would have known at once how to have acted in the matter, instead of sending for remanded prisoners from the House of Correction, and assembling them before Chief (?) Taiwo, to tell them they were free. The Superintendent of Police, too, did not know what he was taking a summons against Callamand for; hence he narrowly escaped having a law-suit about his ears. Moreover, this state of things lessens the authority of the police, and renders nearly abortive their exertions to maintain ordinary peace; for when once the people of Lagos think that Taiwo\'s influence with Mr. Dumaresq is sufficient to free them from the hands of the police, there is no knowing what amount of mischief they will do.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""In short, Africans incurred heavy social and economic costs under colonial rule.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 455, 'article_title': 'THE WHITE NILE', 'full_section_title': 'THE WHITE NILE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': 'We learn also by a communication from Mr. J.

We stated some time since that these were all slavetraders, and had complete rule over the country, in which they were committing great atrocities. The ""Dutch Ladies"" wished to go to Niama. Two of the most influential traders—viz., Biselli and Ali Amouri, seem to have been the great culprits. After stating the straits to which they were reduced, owing to the perfidious conduct of these slavetraders, Mr. Tinne says that one of the ladies in their letter goes on to state how negroes were beaten, and in some cases shot, for attempting to relieve them; that Ali Abu Amouri, when applied to for help, refused to give it except upon terms equally outrageous with those of Biselli, and also forbade his negroes to sell to or assist them in any way. Selim also, Ali\'s steward, robbed them in every way possible, and encouraged his men to do so too. Their people attempted to build huts to spend the rainy season in, but Biselli refused the help of his negroes, without which help they could not get materials. M. von Henglin, a well-known scientific traveller who accompanied the expedition, confirms this, and gives particulars of other very atrocious acts. He states that a soldier of his party had bought four elephants\' tusks from a native sheik; on learning which fact the people of the merchant Ali Abu Amouri attacked the negroes, took the sheik and several others prisoners, and killed the sheik\'s wife. The captured negroes would be sold as slaves. M. Kleinzinik, another traveller, had sent them about fifteen porters from a neighbouring station, Roulanda, with corn bought from the merchant Biselli, but having arrived near Biselli\'s zeriba, they were arrested by one of his dragomen, who forced the negroes with threats to return with their loads. They next attempted to buy corn from the tribes of the Niam-Niams; and a sheik was bringing them a good supply, when they were met by men of Ali Abu Amouri, who put both the negroes and Henglin\'s soldiers in irons, and took them to the zeriba of Ali, where the soldiers were at last released, but the negroes detained as slaves, and three of their number, who had escaped, were retaken and shot.

Our intelligence from the Coast this month is very clear on this point. Both military and civil commissioners have made their appearance there. Colonel and Mrs. O\'Connor on a tour of military inspection! Colonel Ord on a tour of civil inspection! They were expected, of course. No considerate Government ever takes its subordinates by surprise, when it wants information as to their doings. ""Set yourselves in order; we are about sending out a special inspector."" Presto—the dirty dens smile in all the purity of new whitewash; the infested lumber-holes are clean swept out! Model station! Model governor! Wise Administration! But for the life of us we cannot comprehend why the report, which is sure to proceed from such an inspection, might not as well be furnished direct to the Home Government from the local authorities themselves, instead of through the very expensive medium of a commissioner sent out expressly in a ship of war. For our old friend of last year\'s Parliamentary discussion, the steam-ship Gladiator, has been detailed on this service. We were rather surprised at this when the news first reached us. We remembered that the Committee of the House of Commons, which is, we suppose, to be named next month, or in March, was first mooted in consequence of supposed extravagant doings at the Gold Coast; and it seemed a strange mode of beginning a wise economy to send out a special commissioner in a ship of war, to be entertained by the respective governors of our forts and settlements at sumptuous champagne banquets given in honour of the pasha with ever so many tails, and of the officers of the ship that conveys him. But it is of course all owing to our ignorance as unofficial persons; as individuals ignorant of the sublime and abstruse knowledge which resides wherever redtape rules and governs. We should be told, perhaps, on inquiry, that the ship costs nothing—she must be employed somewhere—there was a glut of coals at the several coaling stations, and the so enormously paid governors were suffering under such immense pecuniary accumulations, that a little depletion by means of sumptuous hospitality was desirable! And so—yes—and so the Government at home will have dependable information to lay before a Parliamentary committee! Dependable information gathered during a few days\' visit at a prepared station, where the delighted authorities were all ""on hospitable cares intent."" Dependable information! Yes, now we are about it, we may as well make a clean breast of it. We have no belief in the value of inspections thus made, or of supposed information thus obtained. On occasion of the late disgraceful abuses in Cape Coast Prison we suggested that the commodore on the station should be ordered to land there, and hold an open court of inquiry. But for very good reasons, no doubt, this was not deemed to be the proper course. And yet it is only thus that any real and true information can be obtained. We remember to have heard, from good authority, too, that on occasion of a similar tour of inspection to that now making by Colonel Ord, the attention of the commissioner was about to be called to some administrative acts that were thought to be quite unjustifiable. But the commissioner was inexpressibly shocked that anyone should have thought it possible he could listen to such evidence! ""The Governor is a very particular friend of mine, and I cannot hear anything against him."" Of course there was no African Times in those days. We do not suppose for a moment that such an open avowal would be made now, even if Colonel Ord (which we would not for a moment insinuate) were capable of such conduct. The worst we could expect from him under present circumstances would be, that he should hold himself so aloof as to make it impossible for any such communication to be attempted.'}, {'id': 681, 'article_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-0', 'issue_date': '23_09_1865', 'content': '\n\n""Things may be used as mere means to an end; but men cannot be so used without directly or indirectly sharing in such end. It is on this distinction between men and things that all justice, human and divine, is founded."" That this dictum, laid down by high authority, has been from generation to generation violated in Africa and with the Africans by so-called European Christians is patent to every one. Africa is designated, and with but too much truth, as pre-eminently the land of darkness. But dark as Africa is, even the deepest darkness of her superstitious and barbarian night is not so dark as are the pages of that volume in the history of Christendom which chronicles the dealings of European nations, among whose people the blessed precepts of the divine Gospel of peace and love had been promulgated and, nominally at least, received for more than ten centuries, with those stigmatised heathen, who, in the great day of final retribution, may as justly rise up in judgment against our forefathers as may Sodom and Gomorrah against the wilful rejection of the incarnate Son of God. For after all those long centuries of greater or less acquaintance with the doctrine of universal love which Christianity proclaims, they swooped down upon Africa like foul birds of prey, or demons let loose from hell. It is a dreadful volume, and we daily pronounce the condemnation of those whose deeds are there recorded, when in our unreasonable and uncharitable impatience to obtain immediate Christian results for every paltry pound, or even shilling, that we spend in God\'s service among the heathen we denounce as conclusive evidence of his non-conversion every delinquency, every backsliding of the poor African, who, only a few years ago first heard of Christ and His great salvation, and nominally, and we believe in very many cases really, embraced that glorious hope of everlasting life and joy. We cannot see the beam in our own eye—only the mote in our poor brother\'s eye. And although as a national crime with regard to Africa, ours is a thing of the past, the necessity for the continued presence of our slave-repression squadron off the coast of Africa proves, alas! but too well that Christendom has not yet cleared itself from the foul guilt in which it so long revelled at the cost of the blood and tears of Africa. But it is not alone the remnant of the foreign slave-trade which proves that the old leaven which made men look upon Africans as a prey to be devoured, and not as wounded neighbours they were bound to succour, still exists in the European mind. The way in which we nationally grumble of late at the cost of the paltry little bottles of oil and wine that we are supposed to have been pouring into their wounds also proves it. And the Dutch settlements on the Gold Coast afford strong evidence of it. We hope that, after four years\' publication of this journal, our readers know us too well to have supposed that we were giving insertion to the letters which have appeared in it on the subject of ""Dutch African Government"" merely because they were more or less well written, and amusing in some of the incidents related in them. We feel very strongly the necessity of a radical change in the system, the ends, and aims, and objects of Dutch government on the Gold Coast. The ends, aims, and objects are low and vile, and the system and its administrators (as a general rule, to which, however, there are of course exceptions) are not less so. A little trade, a little gold dust, three or four hundred slaves every year for service in Java, under the name of enlisted free soldiers, and the reputation of still having possessions in Africa—are the ends, aims, and objects in view in retaining and keeping up the name of rule and government in those countries. Men—Africans—are still there considered as things, as mere means to an end. Nothing is done to spread civilization and Christianity among them. There is little or no education bestowed—little or no Christian teaching offered. We have freed ourselves, we believe, from Juggernaut in India, but the Dutch patronise, and countenance, and subsidise the wretched and degrading Fetish superstition, whose high priests are murderers, and whose rites are debauchery and every vice. We have felt it our duty to this country, to Africa, and even to the Dutch Government itself, to use the means at our command for exposing this. There are high and honourable men taking part in the Dutch government at the Hague. There are, doubtless, a goodly number of really Christian men in the Dutch Chambers, in whose eyes all this ought to be and must be considered abominable and dishonouring. We indulge the belief that all that is needed to bring about a change is to show these eminent individuals precisely what the thing is with which they are connected, and which they uphold on the African coast, at the cost of something like 11,000l. sterling per annum. Surely it is not worth while to pay money for such disgraceful results? And our exposure of so evil a course has nothing in it that ought to be deemed offensive, or to wound the national pride of the people of the Netherlands. We have proved ourselves to be impartial censors. We do not conceal British errors, British delinquencies and shortcomings in Africa. We do not assume a national pharisaical attitude and position, and point to our national Dutch neighbour as ""that publican."" We have but too much cause even yet to smite upon our own breasts, and confess our unworthiness. But at the same time justice demands that we should say, the presence of the Dutch on the Gold Coast, with such a system, and such men as for the most part administer it, are a great obstacle in the way of British effort to ameliorate the condition of the people of those countries, and bring them within the pale of Christian civilization, with its attendant industrial results. It is bad enough to have to deal with the deep-rooted native vices, and errors, and industrial inertia, without having a focus of aggravated demoralization in neighbouring European settlements to contend with and against also. It is bad enough for us to be occasionally betrayed by our own officials falling under the influence of native vices, instead of setting the example of ennobling Christian virtues, without having in neighbouring settlements what looks at least like an organised system of deliberate continuous evil, under which the very worst practices are personally shared in, and fostered, and encouraged by the chief European authorities. We do not believe that the Dutch Government at the Hague can have been cognisant of what has taken place and what has been done and practised in its name and under its authority at Elmina and elsewhere on the Gold Coast; and in exposing it, so that it may be brought inoffensively beneath their notice, we are not only rendering a service to Africa, but doing as we would have men do to us were we in a position that made us, as they are, morally responsible for acts which bring so much dishonour on the European name. We are not surprised that the local authorities in the Dutch settlements should especially abominate and determine to get rid of Africans who have received education at Sierra Leone or other British settlements. This is only an additional evidence of the influence for good that Sierra Leone and other colonies and settlements where missionaries are bestowing the great civilising boon and agent, education, are exerting on the West Coast of Africa. But we shall feel surprised if the home Netherland authorities, who after all are the real ones, show that they are equally opposed to African advancement. And we look, therefore, for some good results of our labours in this direction also. We have begun with the Dutch settlements and with the evils which they foster and engender—the nuisance which they create. We have no intention of leaving them until such a change shall have been produced as may enable us to praise instead of blame, to eulogise instead of to denounce. And if the Dutch recognise such a change to be impossible under their rule, which we cannot conceive, we should only say, get rid of a responsibility which not only dishonours you in the eyes of the Christian world, but which will assuredly weigh heavily upon you in some way, and at some time or other, in the providential dispensation of Him who ruleth among the nations, and in whose fiat is empire or ruin—prosperity or decay.\n**[SEPTEMBER 23, 1865.]**'}, {'id': 1287, 'article_title': 'THE ALLEGED CRUEL MURDERS BY FLOGGING, UP THE MELICOURIE RIVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ALLEGED CRUEL MURDERS BY FLOGGING, UP THE MELICOURIE RIVER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1868#article-18', 'issue_date': '23_03_1868', 'content': 'In our number for August last we inserted a graphic account of two alleged horrible murders by flogging at a French factory in the Melicourie.

It is considered certain that he will be convicted. He is about seventy-five years of age.\n\nMr. Ussher, the Administrator, has, it is said, not received any reply from the Dutch authorities at Elmina to his remonstrance against the murder of above seventy Fantees in Elmina Territory by the Ashantees (the Dutch allies).\n\nWith 15,000l. in the Colonial Chest here, which is about the sum at present, and 5,000l. at Accra, surely some good thing ought to be set on foot by the Government for the development of the resources of these long-neglected countries.""}, {'id': 1877, 'article_title': 'THE HUGGINS SCANDAL.', 'full_section_title': 'THE HUGGINS SCANDAL.', 'last_edit_date': '06-23-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1870#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_08_1870', 'content': ""The minds of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone have been too deeply stirred up by the atrocities of Mr. Justice Huggins to bow in passive submission to the answer given by Mr. Monsell to Sir John Gray in the House of Commons, relative to the barbarous severity of that whipping judge, who is in every way suited to be the administrator of the laws of Draco.

From the evidence given at the trial it appears that a Frenchman named Tampier, an overseer on the estate of M. de Chazal, one of the most humane planters in the Mauritius, was visiting a field in which a number of labourers were employed, when being displeased with the manner in which one of the coolies performed his task, he struck the man, knocked him down, and, leaping upon his prostrate body, stamped and kicked until his passion expended its strength. The victim died of this treatment within half-an-hour. Notwithstanding this fact, the jury at Tampier\'s first trial could not agree as to their verdict. At the second trial for unpremeditated murder, the jury found the overseer guilty of a common assault, and strongly recommended him to mercy. The Court, however, sentenced him to the maximum penalty allowed by the Code Civile, namely, imprisonment with hard labour for twelve months. The malheureux enfant, as it had become the fashion to call the murderer, was quite overcome at the dreadful sentence, and the effect on the public (with the exception of the coolies) is thus described by a local journal: ""The jurymen walk slowly; they are literally overwhelmed.

They then tried to force an entrance into the house of a Mrs. Smith, who is stated to be a respectable elderly person. Not being able to force the gate, they scaled the wall (12 feet high), broke open the back and front doors of the house, and, having thus entered, shouted their wild ""hurrahs.""

They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend.

Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Treaty-making 1885-1902', 'content': 'Prior to the Berlin Act, European powers had acquired spheres of influence in Africa in a variety of ways - through settlement, exploration, the establishment of commercial posts, missionary settlements, the occupation of strategic areas, and by making treaties with African rulers.$^{41}$ Following the conference, influence by means of treaty became the most important method of effecting the paper partition of the continent. These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.722, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': 'Missionary work, during the period under discussion, was in its pion› eering phase. On the surface it may appear to have made little impact on African societies but, when examined more carefully, it will be found to have already exerted considerable impact. Missionary societies in East Africa were in fact more powerful during this period because they did not have to face the restraints imposed by colonial governments in later periods. As Roland Oliver puts it: The missions became a power in the land, and not a spiritual power only. In Buganda, as at Zanzibar, the native political authority was firmly enough established to include the stranger within its protection. Elsewhere even the missionary who set out with a few dozen porters and tried to settle in a native village had to set up what amounted to a small independent state. 59 The early mission stations were also heavily influenced by their con› centration on establishing colonies for freed slaves. Whether the colonies were on the coast (like Freretown or Bagamoyo) or further inland (like Masasi, Blantyre, Mpwapwa, Tabora or Ujiji), the main intention was to build near the slave caravans and to use freed slaves as a nucleus of the mission colonies. This was consistent with the intention to fight the Arab slave trade. But, in fact, the stations became theocratic states that could even attract political exiles, fugitive slaves and misfits in the societies in which they were situated.$^{60}$ In this way, the mission stations were increasing the weakness of those societies already weakened by the economic pressures of the time and thus reducing their ability to oppose the imposition of colonial rule. In a more general way, it can be said that missionary societies were also the pioneers for colonial rule. Most of the 300 Europeans who had lived on the mainland before 1884 were connected with missionary activities.$^{61}$ Even where they were effectively controlled by a local ruler, the existence of a European mission station with its cultural impact opened the way for a colonial claim during the partition period.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose. Examples of these two developments are found among the Igbo of Nigeria, the Gikuyu of Kenya and the Langi of northern Uganda. ! 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe.

According to the evidence of Mr. Rosenbush, a banker of this colony and Consul for the Netherlands, it appeared that in March last Mr. Walcott had caused a subpoena to be served upon Mr. Rosenbush for the purpose of giving evidence in support of Mr. Walcott's defence in the said libel case. Mr. Rosenbush expressed his surprise when he had the subpoena, and distinctly told Walcott that he knew nothing of the case. On a Friday in the same month Mr. Walcott was in Mr. Rosenbush's banking establishment, when Mr. Rosenbush repeated to him again that he could give no evidence for him, and that it was his intention to go before the Court and state that much, in order to obtain the permission of the Court to leave the colony for the purpose of going to his factory. Walcott then told Rosenbush it was unnecessary for him to go before the Judge, and that he could go away, and that his going away would afford him (Walcott) an opportunity of moving a postponement for the trial of the cause. Mr. Rosenbush then left this for the rivers, and in a few days after Mr. Walcott made an affidavit stating that Mr. Rosenbush was a material and necessary witness for him in the action, and that he verily believed that he could not safely proceed to the trial thereof without the testimony of Mr. Rosenbush, whom he had subpoenaed, and notwithstanding the subpoena he (Walcott) had been informed that Mr. Rosenbush had left the colony. Mr. Walcott further stated in his affidavit that he had not time between the Friday and Saturday to take out a summons to obtain an order for the purpose of having Mr. Rosenbush's evidence taken before the Master of the Court prior to Mr. Rosenbush's leaving the colony for his factory. Mr. Marston produced the affidavit and gave evidence in support of the charge. Mr. Dougan also gave evidence. Mr. Walcott then made a speech in his defence, occupying about two hours, treating the whole affair as perfect nonsense, and asking the Magistrate to dismiss the charge. The Bench decided that there was abundant evidence that Mr. Walcott had deposed to a false statement in his affidavit, and that he must commit him to take his trial at the next Supreme Court. Mr. Walcott asked to be dismissed on his own bail, but his Worship stated that it was too serious a case to allow Mr. Walcott to go out on his own bail, but that he would take two sureties for 200l. each, or one surety for 400l.

The town is occupied by two tribes, and the fact of negotiations having been opened by one of these tribes for the establishment of the factory gave great offence to the other. The mate was seized and imprisoned. This having come to the knowledge of his employers, a number of casks of rum and some ammunition were sent by them as a ransom, but the natives, though retaining the goods, failed to release their prisoner.

At this port a native was under arrest on a charge of murdering his wife. The man's wife, it appears, gave birth to twins, and in accordance with a custom which has been in existence for a very long period, the woman was put to death by her husband. This coming to the ears of the Consul, the man was arrested and put in prison. Consul Hopkins having been suddenly called to New Calabar, the trial of the man was postponed until his return.

The Consul has expressed himself fully determined to put an end to the practice, and if the murder is clearly brought home to the man, the extreme penalty of the law will be carried out.\n\nConsul Hopkins then proceeded to Bonny, to endeavour to effect an arrangement of the disputes at New Calabar, which had led to a suspension of trade there. At Lagos, on the 6th August, news was received from the French port of Cotanoo to the effect that owing to the death of the ruling king's brother, who was killed by some of the Vehmy people, trade was stopped, the king having taken possession of all roads from the interior by way of reprisal.""}, {'id': 5130, 'article_title': 'THE NEW PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA', 'full_section_title': 'THE NEW PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1885#article-22', 'issue_date': '01_06_1885', 'content': 'We learn that the new president for the republic of Liberia is Dr. Wilmot Blyden; his popularity is such at the present moment among the natives, principally of Monrovia, that it is confidently believed that he will continue in office for some time to come.

The thoughts of those who are interested in the welfare, present and future, of Africa—and that is tantamount to saying the whole civilized world—have been directed to that hall in the Palace of the German Chancellor in which the delegates of the European Powers have met to discuss the question, ""What shall we do with it?"" The Treaty of Berlin was in the mouth of every one six years ago: then, in this same hall, and under the presidency of ""the man of blood and iron"" who is the moving spirit at the present gathering, the delegates of Europe met to discuss the best means to be used to bolster up the effete government of Turkey—and ended by taking so much territory away, on the understanding that having less to govern, greater attention could be given to what was still left to the Sublime Porte. But it was well understood that the catastrophe was only deferred; that the final overthrow of the Turkish rule in Europe is inevitable. The present gathering is in every way different to that which preceded it—the object they have in view is to shape the destiny of a continent. We read that on the wall before the Plenipotentiaries hung an immense map of Africa, as if to remind them that their business was not to do with any particular nation, but with a quarter of the world—not with a kingdom that had been great in past days, and, through misgovernment and oppression, had sunk to the level of a tenth-rate Power, but with whole nations concerning whom the page of history is a blank. The future of Africa is in the hands of Europe, and to the Berlin Conference is committed the solution of the question—who is to hold Africa, and on what principles should it be held. The Conference may be said to have arisen in the first instance out of the Congo Treaty of Feb., 1884, between Portugal and Great Britain, which was, in no small measure, due to the discoveries commenced by Commander Cameron and completed by Mr. Stanley, of the immense importance as a trade route of the River Congo, flowing as it does through the heart of Africa, and issuing into the Atlantic Ocean. So long as the trading was confined to a few miles from its mouth, matters were allowed to take their chance. Portugal claimed the sovereignty of the adjacent region, but did nothing to enforce or justify her claim, which was regarded with indifference by most of the Powers, and always disallowed by Great Britain. But when the International African Association came to the front, setting up stations along the river, and thus opening up the interior, when also M. de Brazza claimed a portion of the upper waters for his country, and it was known that France had bargained for what we may call the reversionary interests of the International Association, it became necessary to take some steps to secure order and freedom of trading at the mouths and along the course of what was evidently destined shortly to become one of the leading highways of the world\'s commerce. Lord Granville saw no better way than by recognizing the sovereign rights of Portugal over the strip of coast at the mouth of the Congo, making this acceptance conditional upon the latter\'s agreeing to maintain freedom of trade and navigation, and binding her to secure the execution of this promise under the superintendence of an International Commission similar to that which discharges a like office on the lower waters of the Danube. On these terms, and with the addition of the invariable article requiring co-operation in the extinction of the slave trade, a Treaty was drawn up and signed by the Plenipotentiaries on February 26th last. But before the ratification could take place a storm of indignation was aroused on all sides, the merchants of the two nations principally concerned being loudest in their expressions of disapproval, with the result that the Treaty was never ratified, but allowed to drop out of existence. So that there still remained for disposal the question of the Congo—who should possess it, and how far could the principles of free trade and navigation be maintained? To complicate matters still further, came the action of the Germans, who were suddenly possessed with a mania for colonization, and proceeded to annex various districts along the West Coast, as it is alleged, without paying due regard to the previously acquired rights of others. In abandoning the Congo Treaty, Lord Granville had let fall the suggestion that Portugal and Great Britain might unite in proposing to the other Powers some international arrangement which would prove more acceptable. Prince Bismarck took the hint, and thereupon issued invitations to the Powers to send representatives to Berlin to discuss the measures to be taken, and the result is the assembling of this Conference, which must ever exercise a wide influence upon the future of Africa. It would be premature at present to discuss the proceedings of the Conference and the special Committee of Experts, but one thing would seem to be assured—viz., we shall obtain the material and practical results desired, in fuller measure and with surer guarantees than could be looked for under the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leaders', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The possible influence of Germany upon the future development of the ""Dark Continent"" cannot well be overestimated.

In the course of one week recently, there were laid before the Reichstag no less than three treaties under which chiefs of various tribes on the West Coast place themselves and their people under the protection of the German Empire. The meaning of these treaties is, says Kühlow\'s Trade Review (to which we are indebted for much information as to the German movement all over Africa), sooner or later ""annexation,"" as by them the influence of all other foreign Powers is expressly excluded, while the chiefs place themselves—so far, at least, as all exterior matters are concerned—entirely in the hands of Germany. Under these treaties the natives concerned are assured of protection from foreign foes; but, on the other hand, they undertake not to entertain any warlike intention independently of the Great Power. It is not reasonable to suppose that the natives fully understand the importance of the agreements into which they appear so readily to have entered; but this much at least is clear, that Germany, as she agrees to be responsible for the security of these people in time of trouble, must be prepared to restrain them from anything that would tend to the provocation of surrounding tribes, or from any overt act that would lead to hostilities.

PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations. From the past and present history they might reasonably hope for the dawning of still better, brighter, and happier days upon the future of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Twenty Years in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The last twenty years has been an eventful period in the history of West Africa. It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast.

The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last.

It is, as the Belgians assert, their legitimate boast that, on the initiative of King Leopold II, they opened the Congo to the navigation of the world. It is, therefore, with this part of Africa that they have the most to do. They have established a joint-stock company, called the ""Belgian Company of African Commerce,"" which was incorporated in March, 1882, with a capital of 10,000l. Of this sum about 2,000l. was spent in the purchase of the vessel Akassa, which is, no doubt, destined to do wonders on the Congo river.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Africano (The African Voice), pursued a similar objective as the self-defined guardian of African peasants and workers.

It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

However, regional variations and the empirical nature of administration are noted, suggesting varied implementation across regions. Complementing this, The African Times articles highlight instances where commercial entities, such as the Royal Niger Company, were granted administrative powers, merging trade and governance. The articles discuss the Royal Niger Company's influence over the Oil Rivers Districts and concerns from the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about monopolistic tendencies of chartered companies. The appointment of commercial agents to administrative roles, such as magistrate positions, underscores the blending of commercial and legal authority. The bureaucratic nature is further reflected in the hierarchical structure of administration, with officials and consuls overseeing regions, as seen with Major MacDonald in the Oil Rivers Protectorate.

The arrangement of such authority was asymmetrical, no matter how little existing institutions were modified or subsumed to European needs. At the pinnacle of the administrative system stood the governor or residentgeneral who, while ultimately responsible to his national government, frequently enjoyed the powers of a sovereign.\nThe institutional framework within which he acted varied considerably in size and complexity, but he was usually assisted in the inter-war period by some form of consultative council or commercial interests. The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa. The continued use of this military term was a reminder of the nature of colonial acquisitions. Over the cercle, a European administrator exercised colonial authority and directed both the activities of his European subordinates and the African authorities enlisted in the colonial administration."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.737, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""This broad sketch of indirect rule in Northern Nigeria can be aligned with another which, like Lugard's, met most success in regions overlaid with Muslim political institutions. Reaching beyond Africa in scope, this form of indirect administration was primarily given theoretical definition by the French. What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910. Association, he therein stated, is 'indirect adminis› tration, with the preservation but improved governance of the institutions of the conquered peoples, and with respect for their past'. '$^{3}$ With the publication in 1923 of Sarraut's La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, the policy was given the aura of official sanctity.\nOriginally suggested for Indochina and later extended as policy to Africa, 'association' was none the less geographically limited as a colonial practice. Only in Morocco did the French seriously consider it, and there primarily because of the attention given to indigenous affairs by the ResidentGeneral, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, who, in the initial years of the protec› torate, ruled with few restrictions from the metropolitan government. Throughout Morocco the forms of the Sherifian state were preserved, while at the local level administrative activities were strikingly similar to those proposed by Lugard. The French contrôleur civil was to perform in an advisory not a supervisory capacity with respect to the cadi, a Muslim official fulfilling magisterial functions in accordance with the shari'a. A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

But the new governors were overthrown and replaced by pre-existing dynasties during widespread revolts against his increasingly harsh rule. 20 The similarities between Liberia's and Ethiopia's political systems were too obvious from the analysis thus far to belabour. Besides possessing a core and periphery, and a central government, each had sub-political systems centred on local chiefdoms (or villages) like those of the Gola in Liberia or the Oromo ('Galla') in Ethiopia not discussed in this chapter, with political cultures more or less different from the dominant political culture at the centre. Both systems were solidly based on privilege at the core, and extensively utilized patronage and assimilation techniques. Nevertheless, whereas Ethiopia's imperial system was largely 'African', lacking political parties or parliament - Tewodros, Yohannes and Menelik became Emperor by virtue of their superior military power over their rivals, and not through the ballot box - Liberia's central government was thoroughly western.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The history of the development of India under the fostering rule of the Honourable East India Company proves the correctness of this theory, and to her Majesty's ministers it appears that the Royal Niger Company occupies an analogous position in its own district. The charter which was granted to the Niger Company some years ago is sufficiently careful in safeguarding the interests of others, and the success which has attended its administration of the district in question appears fully to justify an extension of its authority in the direction of the Oil Rivers. Surely the great desideratum is the civilisation and improvement of the long neglected races on the West Coast of Africa, to whom Great Britain owes so vast a debt, and so long as that is accomplished it matters little whether it be effected by a commercial corporation endued with exceptional powers, or be left to be gradually evolved as the result of individual effort—except that in the latter case it will take a much longer time to produce the result aimed at."", 'last_edit_date': '1892-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1892#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Proposed Charter of the African Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'on a trading company for administering the whole of the country through which the Niger flows, and now great efforts were being made by the African Association Limited to obtain by Royal Charter similar powers over the palm oil river district—namely, Benin, Toreados, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, and Old Calabar. Since the charter was granted to the Niger Company several of his customers who had been connected with the Niger trade had written to him to say that it was impossible for anyone but the Niger Company themselves to do business, and so they were obliged to give up trading on that river. Consequently he took it upon himself to write to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, drawing attention to this fact and begging his lordship to take the matter in hand, and see that common fairness was done to all who were anxious to trade in the Niger River. In his own opinion justice would never be done to the natives and the merchants until the administrative department was altogether separated from the trade and from those engaged in trade. He would be very sorry to see such powers as had been given to the Niger Company conferred upon the African Association, because it was quite obvious the interests of the native traders and producers were not likely to be fairly dealt with where all questions in dispute had to be settled by the officers of a trading corporation interested in making the utmost profit for their employers. There was a large body of native traders and producers in the oil district, increasing in number and importance every year. If a monopoly were created, such as was being sought for, the native traders and producers would have only one large customer, who would buy their produce on his own terms. The revenue to be derived from the district, if administered by the government of a Crown colony or annexed to the colony of Lagos, would pay its administrative expenses, the trade of the palm oil rivers district being the most valuable of the West Coast of Africa. The Lagos colony itself, with a trade about a third the volume of that of the oil rivers, showed in ten years a surplus revenue of £65,000. In the memorial the inhabitants of Lagos said: ""The rivers comprising the deltas of the Bights of Benin and Biafra form a belt of outlets to a vast produce-yielding interior, rich with natural resources and teeming with hundreds of thousands of Africans who are ready and willing on favourable terms to grant admission to their countries, and to barter their produce and manufacturers for European goods and merchandise. To develop and build up this great commerce, and to Christianise and civilise the native population is the problem which her Majesty\'s Government is now called upon to solve. We have no hesitation in asserting that it can only be done by free, legitimate, and unfettered commerce, fostered and protected directly by her Majesty\'s Government, for there can be no two opinions as to the necessity for free and unfettered competition in the development of the commercial resources of a new and dormant country, and the results to commerce and civilisation in the littoral possessions of her Majesty on this coast abundantly testify as to what may be obtained under proper conditions; and Lagos could be cited as an instance in which the above influences have, within a very few years, transformed it from a barbarous and unimportant place into a progressive civilised colony, with a total export and import trade of £906,811, and a revenue of £58,000 per annum. We unhesitatingly assert that it is impossible for these results to be achieved by a trading company invested with administrative powers; for it would naturally, in its own interest, pursue a policy advantageous to itself, and which could have no other tendency than to stagnate the thrift and industry necessary to the healthy development of a country and its resources."" The administrative department of the colony of Lagos had worked very well for all concerned, and it seemed convenient to annex the oil rivers first to that colony. The district extended from 300 to 400 miles on the coast of Africa, between the German boundary and the Cameroons, and the eastern boundary of the British Crown colony of Lagos, and inland to the territories of the Niger Company, and over this area the African Association wished to have the monopoly of trade. The country was densely populated. This district was at present under Imperial protection and the jurisdiction of consular courts, which was better than under the administration of a company formed for private gain. It would be infinitely better under administration as a Crown colony, and he trusted that a Crown colony would be established in connexion with apart from the colony of Lagos.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1890#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger Trouble', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A leading article in the same paper goes on to remark that the letter of ""African Merchant"" expresses the sentiments of the African trade generally outside the Royal Niger Company; but we imagine the writer has misconstrued the Foreign Office statement about a return to the old system being ""impracticable, even if it were desirable."" ""African Merchant"" himself must recognize that such retrogression is not practicable, for it would involve leaving the Niger region to the land-grabbing operations of foreigners with a colonization craze. The British Government wished to prevent a foreign protectorate, and they were glad to find persons prepared to save them trouble and expense. They jumped at the offer of the National African Company, and were not too particular about the effect of entrusting the taxing and administrative powers to a party of traders who might be tempted to handicap competitors to secure to themselves a practical monopoly. It is true that the Charter purports to preserve the rights of other traders, but due and licence charges are doing the monopolists\' work on the Niger. What Liverpool merchants ask is that the Charter shall be revoked, and the administrative powers conferred on a non-trading organization. In the present company the dual position of governors and traders is anomalous, and leaves the management open to suspicion. The quotation from the Foreign Office letter suggests that Lord Salisbury has misconceived the desires of independent merchants and traders. They do not wish to return to the old system, but to secure such arrangements as will prevent the trade of the Niger being injured for the benefit of a chartered and limited company. They have established a case for that inquiry which should have preceded the grant of a charter. The incubus is the more galling from the circumstance that authority is conferred on a new company, to the detriment of merchants engaged in the trade of the rivers forming the Niger delta. Before the Government adopted so important a step as chartering one set of traders, they should have obtained the views of merchants who know something of the region in question. So far, the agents of the company do not appear to have achieved any administrative triumphs; their capacity seems to be limited to providing fellow-traders with grievances and driving out of the river the smaller class of traders.

The “Africa Order in Council” referred to, deals with all contingencies likely to arise, in minute detail. In a region like that of the Oil Rivers, one cannot expect law and order to be enforced in the same rigid manner as in Europe, or even in the Cape, or an old Crown colony. Much must be left to the Commissioner’s tact and discretion. A body of Haussas are now being enlisted for the police service, and in time we may hope that the law will reach well into the interior, and that free traffic will be carried on without the intervention of middlemen. The numerous creeks and rivers form useful waterways, though they are hotbeds of malaria. It will be the business of the Commissioner and his staff, moreover, to encourage and even carry on experiments in the way of introducing new cultures and new industries. Major MacDonald has been in communication with Kew and with Sir Alfred Moloney, who has done such good work in Lagos. He will take out with him a large supply of seeds of various kinds, and begin by establishing an experimental garden at Old Calabar.\n\nMajor MacDonald’s own head-quarters will be at Old Calabar, where there is some kind of Consular building. But, of course, he will be pretty constantly on the move. His Vice-Consuls will be stationed as follows: General Hammill on the Bonny River; Mr. T. A. Wall at Old Calabar; Captain H. L. Gallwey on the Benin River; Captain F. Synge on the Forcados; Captain MacDonald on the Brass River; Mr. W. Armstrong on the Opobo River. Each of them will, of course, exercise jurisdiction on his own river, but Major MacDonald will be in constant communication with them, and it is hoped that very soon all the rivers will be connected by telegraph. The treasurer of the Commissionership is Mr. J. F. Roberts, while Mr. Tanner is Major MacDonald’s private secretary. There are besides four Consular clerks—Mr. Steains, Mr. C. Harrison, Mr. F. Wilding, and Mr. G. Quilter. This is a large staff, but not too large for the many duties which will have to be performed, in a climate where it is hardly safe to stay for more than a year at a time. It is hoped that the Customs dues to be collected will defray the cost of administration. Of course, the whole arrangement is a compromise. But it is to be expected that in time, under Major Macdonald, the progress made will be such as to justify the taking over of the Oil Rivers as a Crown colony. British connexion with West Africa has had many vicissitudes. Our colonies have been abandoned; have been made over to companies; taken over by the Crown, and generally treated without any sort of continuity of policy. Now that we have put our hands to one of the richest commercial regions on the continent, it is to be hoped we shall persevere in a policy of gradual development.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Royal Niger Company', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""There are, however, two main alternatives between which the Government—and ultimately, perhaps, the taxpayer—may be called upon to decide. It is a matter of fairly unanimous consent, to which Lord Selborne's published letter has given official sanction, that the time has come to separate the functions of commerce and administration in the Niger territories. No one, perhaps, is a more cordial advocate of this view than the Governor of the Niger Company. There is no disagreement between the authorities principally concerned and the public upon the fundamental aspect of the question, but the difficulty which may arise will be in connexion with the execution of any practical proposal. Hitherto the achievements of the Niger Company and the administration of its territories have cost the taxpayer nothing. It was necessary that the money to meet these expenses should be provided from private sources, and the trade of the Company was the method by which it was provided. To keep the administration on its feet it was absolutely essential that the Company as a trader should be successful. Hence care and capital have been devoted to its commercial organisation, and as it could not without suicide in the present conditions of a young trade encourage competitors on easy terms it has acquired the reputation of a monopolist. As a matter of fact, the administrative regulations of the Company are under the strictest Imperial supervision, and they do not discriminate in a single particular against other trade. Legally all trade in the Company's territories is on an footing equal with its own. As a trader it pays exactly the same Customs dues and conforms to the same obligations as other traders, but actually its position gives it advantages, especially in the matter of transport, with which no firm organised on a less extensive scale could profitably compete. This position the Company is willing to renounce, but it is clear that in such an event the money which has hitherto been provided by these means to meet the cost of administration and development must be derived from other sources, and the shareholders of the Company must be enabled to withdraw their invested capital upon reasonable terms. It is with the shareholders' money that the whole Nigerian enterprise has been carried out.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

That man had his own private interest, backed up by Government authority, and he went on pushing his contracts in the name of the Government till he went too far, and, perhaps, trod upon the toes of the English traders. Then representations were made by our traders, communications passed between the foreign Government and our own Foreign Office, and the matter was settled by the foreign Government simply saying that the man had exceeded his instructions. It was necessary, in order to stop that class of agents from going beyond their instructions, to set the English Government to work. The Government of England represented the people, and unless the people formed on opinion, and represented it to the Government, it did not seem to be the duty of the authorities to act.

A similar case arose some two or three years ago in the neighbourhood of Lagos, where the French were doing the same thing as they were now doing at Sierra Leone. They tried to get behind the Colony of Lagos, and made a treaty with the King of Abeokuta in order to cut off the stream of trade that came down from the interior to Lagos, and to turn it down to the French territories so that it might be exported from French ports. The chamber sent a deputation to Lord Knutsford, and his lordship had to go to the Foreign Office in order to communicate with the French Government.

It details the harsh conditions imposed by colonial rule, such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and lack of educational opportunities, which fueled discontent among African peasants and workers. Newspapers and associations played a crucial role in voicing opposition to colonial injustices, and international observers and historians have criticized colonialism's impact on African sovereignty and culture. Similarly, The African Times articles report instances of misgovernment, such as the appointment of officials without competitive examinations, the combination of incompatible offices, and the imposition of European officials over Africans without due process. They document brutal treatment of natives, including floggings, torture, and murder, as well as the exploitation of African workers in the Congo Free State. The articles also criticize the negative impact of alcohol imports, the renewal of the slave trade, and the colonial administration's focus on policing rather than education, alongside the neglect of sanitary conditions in African towns. While the articles note some efforts by colonial officials to improve conditions, such as appointing Africans to public offices and opening trade routes, the overall narrative aligns with the claim of resistance and criticism from both local populations and international observers, illustrating a complex and multifaceted colonial experience.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial administrations in Africa faced widespread criticism and resistance due to their oppressive practices.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War.

The Chope, living in southern Mozambique, for example, developed an entire repertoire of songs denouncing the colonial regime in general and the hated tax official in particular: We are still angry; its always the same story The oldest daughter must pay the tax Natanele tells the white man to leave him alone Natanele tells the white man to leave me be You, the elders must discuss our affairs For the man the whites appointed is the son of a nobody The Chope have lost the right to their own land Let me tell you about it 89 The work songs of labourers employed by Sena Sugar Estates were even more explicitly hostile, often depicting the European overseers in the most unflattering sexual terms.$^{90}$ To the north the Makua and Makonde artists ridiculed state officials - both African and European - in highly stylized carvings which distorted their features and eliminated their humanity.""', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""Like the slaves in the American South, many African peasants covertly retaliated against the repressive system.

The dominant European popula› tion, as in the United States, perceived these forms of 'day-to-day resistance' as prima facie evidence of the docility and ignorance of their subordinates rather than as expressions of discontent. 34 Tax evasion occurred with great frequency throughout all of Central Africa. Just before the arrival of the tax collector, all or part of a village would flee into an inaccessible region until the state official departed. In Northern Rhodesia, the Gwemba Tonga were notoriously successful evaders, as were their Bisa and Unga neighbours who fled into the Bagwelu swamps.$^{35}$ This practice was so common in Mozambique that one official noted in disgust, 'It remains unknown how many times six or more adults will flee from their kraal leaving only a blind, ill or elderly individual who is exempt from taxes'.$^{36}$ Those Africans fortunate enough to live along international borders could slide back and forth across the frontier avoiding the tax collectors of both colonies. The Yaka periodically fled across the Kwango River which separated Angola and the Congo, while their compatriots took advantage of the unpatrolled frontier to cross into the French Congo where they remained until harassed by local tax officials. 37 A similar strategy was employed by disenchanted members of the rural populations living in the Milanje region along the Nyasaland-Mozambique border and in the Gaerezi Valley separating Rhodesia and Mozambique."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': 'Fed up with supporting you, with suffering the terrible consequences of your follies, your demands, with the squandering misuse of your authority.\nWe are no longer willing to make greater and greater useless sacrifices ...\nWe can no longer stand the pernicious effects of your political and administrative decisions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola', 'content': ""Regarded as nonentities by the Europeans, subject to corporal punishment, and sometimes to arbitrary and venal treatment at the hands of the colonial authorities, to the demands of labour-recruiters and the collusion between government officials and resident Portuguese, Africans became outcasts in their own countries. They did, however, have several means of escaping the pressures that were brought to bear on them.\nThe first form of resistance consisted of taking up arms, but this was steadily abandoned from the end of the First World War since it was ultimately and hopelessly doomed to failure. There were fewer and fewer leaders, most weapons had been confiscated and gunpowder was, with a few exceptions, no longer available on the open market. The second alternative was to go into hiding. When the situation became intolerable, entire villages abandoned their fields and moved to areas furthest from the reach of the colonial authorities. Peasant flight was particularly common in the northern and eastern regions which remained effectively outside Lisbon's control. Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final. There is widespread evidence of massive clandestine emigration into the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia and even South West Africa. Often members of the rural population travelled great distances through harsh terrain with young children on their backs to free themselves from the tyranny of Portuguese colonial rule. If they were caught by the colonial authorities or the local African police, the men were beaten and imprisoned and the women sexually abused.\nThe fourth type of resistance to colonial rule were the religious or messianic cults founded by Africans in reaction to the colonial religion.

The first was peasant protest. Often sporadic, isolated and largely with low visibility, various expressions of peasant protest were nevertheless widespread during the period under examination. In addition, many peasants and urban dwellers articulated their opposition to the culturally arrogant and racist system through the medium of the independent churches which flourished in South Africa. Still others joined the African National Congress - the oldest nationalist organization on the continent. By the 1920s an embryonic African working-class movement had also emerged - symbolized by the meteoric growth of the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union under the leadership of Clements Kadalie.\nIn response to increased impoverishment and economic uncertainty which accompanied the transformation of much of the rural South African area from a peasant economy to a labour reserve, peasants engaged in a number of actions to minimize or eliminate increasing political and econo› mic pressures. Most forms of resistance were designed to protect their land and livestock, and to protest against increased taxation and labour demands. Often these were individual acts such as flight, tax evasion, violation of registration laws and attacks on loyalist chiefs and police.$^{7}$ In other cases, they represented more coherent and organized forms of opposition such as the anti-dipping campaign.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': 'At a time when the Allied colonial regimes in Africa could least afford trouble in their own backyards, their authority - still only tenuously established in places like southern Ivory Coast, much of Libya, or Karamoja in Uganda - was widely challenged by armed risings and other forms of protest by their subjects. As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere.

Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity. 'The shift in primordial loyalties repre› sented a new level of political consciousness in which the Portuguese were perceived for the first time as the common oppressor.' 20"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North-East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'based on a contribution by the late ABBAS I.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Most of the discussion, if not all of it, has been centred on the dichotomy between resisters, who by implication are to be praised as heroes, and so-called collaborators, who also by implication are to be condemned as traitors. This classification came about as a result of the nationalist struggle for independence in Africa, as elsewhere in the world. Those involved in the movement tended to see themselves as heirs to a long tradition of struggle whose roots go back to the beginning of this century, if not earlier. It was assumed that independence was a good thing and to strive for it was natural. Consequently, all those who had resisted European penetration of Africa, in order to preserve its inde› pendence, were heroes to be emulated and given an honourable place in the histories of the countries that had gained their independence through resistance to colonial rule. Put in these terms, this view is an attempt to use the standards of the present, with the aid of hindsight, to interpret the events of the past. In the colonial situation, those who resisted were described by colonial officials as short-sighted while those who collaborated were seen as far-sighted. Today, nationalist historians in East Africa con› demn so-called collaborators, especially chiefs, and praise resisters. 1\nAmong the resisters, there were also divisions.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

So strongly is this feeling expressed that the list of official appointments of Africans, which we insert on another page, is sent to us with the expression of doubt that we shall insert it. This is very unjust to us, and measuring us by a standard that ought not to be applied to us. So far from feeling any disinclination to do so, we are only too happy to insert anything that can place the many good official acts of the actual Administrator-in-Chief prominently beneath the eyes of all men, and we beg to thank our informant for putting us in possession of the means for showing all that has been done in the very important question of the filling the public offices in Africa with Africans. The list shows that a very steady move in this most right and much desired direction has been made by the present head of the Executive.

It appears, however, that the facts are as stated; and we must say that we do not think they are fully answered by the statement that some Africans have been moved up a step in public offices without being subject to competitive examination. Our own opinion is that continuous competitive examinations for those who are already in the public employ are unjust; that a man once admitted into an office is entitled to be moved up to the superior grades in the same office, subject to his being reduced again should he show a manifest incompetency. As we understand the letter and complaints we inserted, it was not that a European had been admitted to an office instead of an African, but that he had been admitted without a competitive examination being held for establishing that he was more worthy by his attainments than any of the possible African candidates.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them.

They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement.

Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Oppression by Europeans in the Opobo River', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—I must again complain to you that since July last, we, the two or three African traders in this river, have not been allowed to ship our oil. I am going to inform you of my position in this place. I had been with Jaja, when he was at Bonny, since January 5, 1865. I used to go to Lagos (where I belong to) sometimes for change on account of health, and returned to the said mentioned Jaja, and since then from the war of 1869, which brought us all to this river (Opobo), when only two Europeans entered this river, Mr. Sterling, agent for Charles Horsfall and Son, came in the river and traded with Jaja and his chiefs. At first, Consul Livingstone refused to protect them, but by much complaining to the Foreign-office in London, he was obliged to protect them. All their letters regarding the same were written by me, although I am an African born; I am obliged to act on the part of Jaja; and since the war was finished in January, 1873, trading has been going on very briskly. I, myself, am only trying with what little wages I got from Jaja during the time I was working for him. I asked permission of King Jaja to try to trade a little in the only way I then could—i.e., by bringing country clothes from Lagos to Opobo to be bartered for palm oil. The King agreed to this in consideration of the long time I was with him. I tried my best to pick up some few casks of palm oil with the country cloths, and against the time of my shipping oil, I took the oil on board the steamship Forcados, British and African Steam Navigation Company, to ship this oil to Liverpool. The captain refused to receive the oil, stating that the chairman in this river refused to allow him to receive any oil from us in the town, even from the natives. Since then, I have never been allowed to ship my oil to Liverpool. I did not know what to do; I had written to the agents of the Company, but received no reply. I cannot write to the Consul anything respecting it, as I believe the Consul is all for the Europeans in this river, because the Consul once asked King Jaja why he did not send away every Sierra Leone and Lagos man from his town. The King answered him, how can he drive human beings like himself from his country, since they had done nothing wrong? To this the Consul had nothing to say, only stating that he will not protect us as British subjects. Is this right on the part of Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, to insist on an African king turning out an African born man from his country? Dear Mr. Editor, I will only for the present ask you to notice these great evils in your paper, and try your very best to enable us to ship our palm oil from this river from time to time. We are poor Africans; we are in need of trying our best to pick up a few pence for our daily...\n\nbread, and we are very sorry to see the way these big merchants are trying to ruin us poor Africans, by preventing the captains of the mail steamers from receiving poor Africans' palm oil on board of their steamers."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-10-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1874#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Outrage on a British Captain by Africans', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That the Local Government believe more in police and gaols, as you have observed, than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education, is self-evident; for whereas several thousands of pounds are annually voted to the former and expended, the few hundred pounds voted to the latter are doled out so niggardly and irregularly, that it seems almost a matter of regret an ordinance was ever passed in its favour.

There is much to discourage us in our work for Africa and its people. It is so difficult to make those who, for themselves and their posterity, are most interested in the results we may achieve comprehend how hard the task of social and administrative reformation is; and that it is their and our duty to persevere in efforts to obtain and secure it, in spite of all the obstacles that vice and egotism, long enthroned evils in West Africa, may marshal against us. Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress. Occasionally our path is cheered by some enthusiastic testimony to the good we are effecting; but for the most part we have to complain of a seeming apathetic indifference, which greatly dishonours those who evince it. We are entitled, after eleven years of unrequited labour, to say, that it is a flagrant disgrace to every African who can read and does not subscribe to this paper and pay for it. Men ought to feel ashamed to borrow it of their neighbours when they can themselves procure it by paying the modest sum of five shillings a-year for it. The letters which appear in this present number show the urgent necessity of administrative reforms as a means of obtaining what is of vital importance; these reforms must be forced upon the Government, Imperial and Local, as they will never be spontaneously accorded; and the only way in which they can be thus forced is by the publicity given to the evidences of need of them, in the columns of the African Times. There are doubtless some of the most intelligent of the educated Africans in every settlement who fully comprehend all this—and to them we say, they do not perform their duty by merely subscribing to and reading our paper; they ought to form themselves everywhere into committees for furthering subscriptions to it. Of course we can only expect this from independent, high-minded men, who are indifferent to paltry official bribes, and fearless of official disfavour; but surely there are some of these to be found in every British settlement on the West Coast, and we leave the matter for the present in their hands.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1871#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages.

The General History of Africa highlights that European powers partitioned Africa into about forty political units, with approximately 30% of the borders drawn as straight lines, often cutting across ethnic and linguistic boundaries. This arbitrary boundary-making led to chronic border disputes, such as those between Sudan and Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia, and Nigeria and Cameroon.

The European powers had partitioned the continent into some forty political units. The new boun¬ daries have been regarded by some scholars as unacceptable because they were deemed to be arbitrary, artificial, precipitate and haphazard and to have distorted the national pre-European political order. Others, such as Joseph Anene and Saadia Touval, have regarded them as making more sense than they did by 1879.63\nThere is some truth in both points of view. Some 30% of the total length of the borders were drawn as straight lines, and these and others often cut right across ethnic and linguistic boundaries. On the other hand, the remaining borders did follow national boundaries and cannot therefore be considered as arbitrary or as ill-considered as the criticisms would suggest. Moreover, African political units evolving as a result, for example, of the Oyo-Dahomey conflict, the Fulani djihâds, the Mfecane in Southern Africa, or the internal struggle for power in both Ethiopia and Uganda during the second half of the nineteenth century, testify to the fluidity of African boundaries, frontiers and enclaves prior to the partition. What is not often realized is the extent to which the partition solidified these fluid boundaries, or the extent of the efforts made by the boundary com› missioners to rectify anomalies, where politically possible, during the numerous boundary delimitations. On balance, then, although the map of Africa in 1914 (see Fig. 2.1), compared to what it was in 1879, may have looked very confusing, the delimitation had nevertheless been a remarkably efficient job, thanks to the new advances in cartography. And although the partition must be condemned as illegal and immoral, and it must be recognized that some of the boundaries were indeed artificial and arbitrary, it would be undesirable - indeed dangerous - to continue to advocate a return to the fluid, pre-European international boundaries except after a very close scrutiny - because of the 'mess' said to have been created by the partition."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved. Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta.

Both doctrines, in short, had no legitimacy in international law.$^{54}$ 'The modern doctrine of Hinterland', Salisbury observed in 1896, 'with its inevitable contradictions, indicates the un› informed and unstable condition of international law as applied to territorial claims resting on constructive occupation or control.'$^{55}$ In other words, 'a claim of sovereignty in Africa can only be maintained by real occupation of the territory claimed'.$^{56}$ And since the notion of effective occupation with which the vast majority of the African states were unfamiliar - and the African notion of the real meaning of these treaty relations with Euro› peans were in fundamental contradiction with one another, the situation of conflict was bound to be intensified.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow.

It seems evident from the above, then, that it was not the British occupation of Egypt in 1882 that triggered off the Scramble, as has been argued by Robinson and Gallagher,$^{38}$ but rather the events of the period 1876 to 1880 in different parts of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The beginnings of the Scramble', 'content': ""Although by the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the European powers of France, Britain, Portugal and Germany had acquired commercial interests and were exercising considerable influence in different parts of Africa, their direct political control there was extremely limited.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Contrary to general belief, such an approach is no ingenious discovery of the 'new' African historiography. J. S. Keltie's remarkable book, The Partition of Africa,$^{27}$ published in 1893, does note perceptively that the Scramble of the 1880s was the logical consequence of the nibbling at the continent which started some 300 years ago. It also gives a nodding acceptance to the view that the partition was economic› ally motivated although that is not its central argument. In the 1930s, George Hardy, the prolific French colonial historian, also demonstrated the local African dimensions of the partition, and he treated Africa very much as a historical unity. Like Keltie, he argues that although the immediate cause of partition was the economic rivalry of the countries of industrial Europe, it was at the same time an important phase in the longstanding contact between Europe and Africa. He suggests that African resistance to increasing European influence precipitated the actual conquest just as the increasing commercial rivalry of the industrialized nations led to the partition. 28 For a long time such views of the partition were ignored. But with the publication in 1956 of K. Onwuka Dike's classic Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta,$^{29}$ the African dimension of the partition was resurrected. Although Dike's book is limited in its time span and geographical range, it nevertheless encouraged a generation of historians to begin to treat the partition in the context of a long period of contact of different races and cultures. Unfortunately, while Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage demonstrate this extended relationship in their very popular Short History of Africa, 30 they still emphasize the European rather than the African dimension of the partition. It is therefore refreshing that A. G. Hopkins' important study,$^{31}$ although limited in its geographical scope, should attempt an African-oriented reinterpretation of imperialism in West Africa. His con› clusion is worth quoting: At one extreme it is possible to conceive of areas where the transition from the slave trade was made successfully, where incomes were main› tained, and where internal tensions were controlled.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > Global strategy', 'content': 'There is a third school which maintains that the European interest in Africa which gave rise to the Scramble was a matter of global strategy, not economics. The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

A number of issues arise from this that should be emphasized. One was that the pattern of local and regional trade was of course far more dependent on the internal dynamics of the African communities - particularly the systems of production in agriculture, crafts and manufacture - than on the stimulation coming from outside. The second was that, compared with the internal trade, the external trade - at least initially - was secondary in the life of the majority of African peoples. It was nevertheless important because it brought in the critical factor from outside that might have made the difference in the fortunes of those who controlled it and those who did not. It is not easy to draw up a sliding scale of its growth in relative importance as a source of revenue to the African rulers, or as a source of essential commodities that could not be obtained elsewhere. The most important of such essential commodities was, for most African states, firearms. The European policy of seeking to control the trade in firearms in their own self-interest tended to make trade as a possible source of firearms far more important in the estimation of many a ruler than it actually was, since the possession of guns did not everywhere confer military superiority.\nA third issue arising from the growth of the external trade is its import› ance, on the sliding scale, not only relative to internal local and regional trade, but also relative to agriculture. Whatever importance particular rulers might have attached to the external trade, there can be no doubt that throughout the early nineteenth century it remained peripheral to agriculture in terms of the total activity of African peoples. As employers of labour, providers of basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter and as the sources of raw materials for crafts and manufactures, etc., it is inexplicable that the agricultural systems should be treated as if they were less important than trade generally, and, more specifically, external trade.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 537, 'article_title': 'THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE', 'full_section_title': 'THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-6', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': ""The Union Company's Cape Royal mail steamship Roman, Captain W.

In the absence of more precise information upon the subject there is, however, no need to attribute to the movement the serious significance which might be supposed to attach to such an apparently unfriendly act. It may rather be regarded as one more instance to be added to a list already long illustrating the somewhat dangerous detachment which circumstances appear to have produced between the local representatives of French influence and energy on the outlying borders of Greater France and the responsible authorities of the French Government at home. We have as a nation too keen an appreciation of the value of individual initiative and enterprise to have any desire to be pedantic on the subject. It is evident that the French leader of the present expedition ought to have been informed of the conditions which precluded him from entering the territory of Boussa, or Busa, with the intention of occupying the country. But the correctness displayed by the French home authorities on previous occasions in dealing with somewhat similar acts on the part of over-zealous lieutenants leaves no reason to suppose that they will on the present occasion fail to show due consideration for international obligations. It is inevitable under the present system of European expansion that border mistakes should occasionally occur. They become serious only when they are adopted by the responsible Governments on either side, and the withdrawal of the Toutée expedition from Southern Boussa last year in acknowledgment of the justice of the remonstrance offered by the British Government, should serve as a guarantee that no irregular aggression will be countenanced by the French Government in the Northern portion of the same province.\n\nThe legitimate position in Boussa can only be determined by a strict consideration of the facts. The British Government will ask no more; the French Government, if we have rightly interpreted the manner in which they have met us on some previous occasions, will desire to grant no less. To appreciate the facts it is, unfortunately, necessary to enter into the little-known history of our mutual relations in places where the names, dates, latitudes—all are strange, and no general knowledge serves to give life to the details. A brief summary of the history of the determination of the British and French frontier lines in that part of Africa is inevitably dull.

She further claims that, according to the terms of the treaties of 1885 and 1887 between herself and the Congo Free State, the latter has no right to cross either the Ubanghui or the 4th degree of latitude, which lies upon it. In reply, King Leopold invokes the right of first occupant. His contention is that France has never taken the trouble to develop or even explore the region in question, that Belgium has spent money and men in pacifying this part of Africa, and that consequently, if anyone has a right to hold it, the Belgians have that right, whereas the French, who have done nothing, have not. He also takes exception to the interpretation which France has put upon certain clauses of the treaties of 1885 and 1887. Now the French declare they will have none of this, and are sending out Captain Monteil, ostensibly to force the Belgians to retire. King Leopold says nothing, but is forwarding fresh reinforcements to the Ubanghui, and seems determined to resist French aggression. We cannot look upon this matter without the gravest apprehension of the consequences it may bring forth. African affairs have now reached a stage which is, perhaps, the most important and the most crucial since the scramble for territory began. The continent has been opened up from the north, south, east, and west, but hitherto the centre has been barely touched. But it must be borne in mind that Central Africa is practically the key of the whole African question. North African, South, East, and West African questions are all bound up with, and dependent upon, the Central African question. Politicians and writers can twist agreements and protocols, treaties and conventions to serve their particular kind of argument; they can put what interpretation they think fit upon them. But the one fact remains, that upon the settlement of Central Africa depends all Africa, and the Power which shall establish itself the most firmly in Central Africa, provided always the same Power has outlets to the coast, will in future ages be the one to control the destinies of Africa. Such being our firm opinion, we cannot help viewing with anxiety the advent of such an abnormally large French expedition upon the scene.

A section of the German Press is taking an anti-English line in respect to the negotiations as to the Hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony and Togoland. This time, however, no ground exists for any cause of alarm on the part of German patriots, and an appeal to Berlin has elicited the statement that what is being done in those regions is with the consent and with the knowledge of both Governments. It is not only of England's advance in Western Africa that German colonists are jealous; a similar state of feeling is entertained, if not openly expressed, towards France. For many reasons this sentiment of suspicion is to be deplored. It handicaps the progress of civilisation, and causes outbursts of ill-temper that do not harmonise with the friendly relations existing between the different European Powers interested in that part of the globe. The matters in dispute are soon rectified, but a feeling of irritation is set up which is not so quickly forgotten. On the Gulf of Guinea, excluding the Republic of Liberia, are situated the French possessions of Assinie and Dahomey, the Gold Coast Colony, the Colony of Lagos, and the Niger Protectorate belonging to Great Britain, and Togoland under the protection of Germany. Originally the frontiers of these territories were open at the rear, and their boundaries were ill-defined, owing to incorrect surveys, disputed titles, and conflicting tribal claims. But of late a change has taken place in this respect. Various treaties have been entered into between England and France, so that the French frontier difficulties have been considerably modified, and a line of future action agreed upon. In 1890, a further step was taken as regards internal delimitation. The French Government, noting that the progress of the two countries must, if unchecked, lead to conflicting claims, suggested that a point should be selected beyond which neither Power should pass. This suggestion was effected by a declaration providing a basis for negotiations for the demarcation of spheres in the regions which extend to the west and to the south of the Middle and Upper Niger. As regards German frontier questions, the Agreement which ceded Heligoland to Germany defines the boundary line between Togoland and the Gold Coast Colony. North of that boundary lies what is known as the neutral zone, within which both parties to the Agreement have bound themselves not to acquire Protectorate.

Its position is indicated on official maps by a square, of which the northern limit is the tenth parallel, and the southern limit lies about 10' above the eighth parallel, the western limit being drawn through 1° 15' west of Greenwich, and the eastern limit through 35' east of Greenwich. These limits do not represent the political frontiers of Native States. They were drawn simply as a matter of mutual convenience as between England and Germany in order to preserve the neutrality of certain important Native trading centres, and the freedom of trade roads, until such time as the hinterlands of the English and German colonies upon the coast should be more definitely delimited, and many Native States lie half within and half without the zone. It will be observed that if the frontier line of the two colonies determined up to the southern limit of the neutral zone were to be prolonged in a straight line, it would leave about one-third of the neutral zone to Germany and two-thirds to England. Of the countries lying to the north of the neutral zone no mention was made in the agreement, but British treaties were in 1892 negotiated with all of them up to the Niger river. Within the zone it was agreed that neither Germany nor England should seek to exercise a preponderating influence or negotiate treaties with the Natives for that purpose, but that all the trading centres, and notably Salaga, should be open to the emissaries of both countries for commercial purposes.\n\nThe agreement was between England and Germany only. France was not a party to it, and to avoid possible complications arising from the fact, measures were taken to secure the British position in the zone as against any Power except Germany. A joint Anglo-German Commission for this purpose was proposed, but the proposal was rejected by the German Government, and Great Britain was forced to act independently. In 1894 a British agent was sent into the zone, and a complete series of treaties was negotiated with the Native chiefs, providing for the maintenance of British authority as against every European Power except Germany. It was carefully explained to the chiefs in every instance that Germany and Great Britain were friends, and that neither was to exercise in the zone an influence inconsistent with the influence of the other. The position was further regularised by full notification to the German Government of all that had been done.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Two British Boundary Treaties in Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Foreign Office has lately laid before Parliament the text of two boundary treaties or agreements in regard to British territories in Africa. The first is with Germany, and relates to the Rio del Rey on the West Coast of Africa. It recites that, ""after discussion of various questions affecting the fiscal interests of Germany and Great Britain in their respective territories in the Gulf of Guinea,"" it has been agreed that the point named in section 2, Article IV., of the Anglo-German Agreement of July 1, 1890, as the upper end of the Rio del Rey creek shall be the point at the north-west end of the island lying to the west of Oron, where the two waterways called Urufian and Ikankan on the German Admiralty chart of 1889-90 meet. From this point to the sea the right bank of the Rio del Rey shall be the boundary between the Oil Rivers Protectorate and the Cameroons, and the German authorities engage not to allow any trading settlements to exist or be erected on the right bank of the creek, while the Oil Rivers Administration agrees not to allow settlements on the western bank of the Backasay Peninsula within certain limits. The treaty laid before Parliament contains a copy of the German Admiralty chart referred to. The second agreement is with Portugal, and relates to the spheres of influence north of the Zambesi. It takes the form of an interchange of notes between Lord Rosebery and the Portuguese Minister in London, recording the understanding come to between the two Governments for a modus vivendi pending delimitation. Pending actual delimitation all the natural lines of demarcation specified in sub-head 2, Article I., of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of June 1891, shall be treated as the boundaries of the spheres of influence. Pending the exact determination of the point where latitude 13° 30\' cuts the eastern shore of Lake Nyassa, Padimba, Makanjira, and the shore south of these places shall be recognised as within the British sphere, and the eastern shore north of the river Lomazi as within the Portuguese sphere. The post erected as a boundary beacon by Mr. Johnson on the right bank of the Shire river shall be accepted provisionally as the ""point just below Chiwanga"" mentioned in the Convention, and a line traced by the Portuguese from that point due west to the watershed between the Shire and the Zambesi shall be accepted similarly as a temporary boundary. The islands of Chisamulu and Lukomo and all the other islands to the south are within the British sphere; and the line formed by the Zambesi from the cataracts at Kalima up to its confluence with the Cabonpo, and thence by the course of the latter, shall be a provisional boundary. Wherever, prior to delimitation, the actual course of the boundary appears doubtful, neither party shall make acquisitions, conclude treaties, or accept sovereign rights in territories which, after delimitation, are likely to be proved within the sphere of influence of the other. Neither in Nyassaland nor in the Loangwa, nor in the Barotze territories shall the modus vivendi be held as prejudging in any way the ultimate territorial rights of either Power. The agreement is to last until July 1896, after which date it may be denounced by either party at three months\' notice, and the work of delimitation is then to begin before the expiration of three months.

Livingstone and Stanley had been busily occupied filling up the map. The secret of the source of the Niger had long been known, and the river itself had been left, in the main, to numerous private traders, who had competed keenly one with another. In 1879 the whole of the English firms doing business on the river coalesced and formed one large company, under the name of the United or National African Company. This combination was a part, and no small part, of the new European movement in Africa. It was formed to combat foreign competition, which had been growing at a rate that augured badly for British interests if resources and efforts remained divided. In this connexion, and in illustration of the view that Africa is being at last treated as a continent, as a theatre of empire and a means of national aggrandisement, Mr. Lucas notes what European peoples were once strong in Africa, and who are they that now prevail.\n\n""The Portuguese,"" he says, ""are still there, but with only a shadow of their former strength; the English are there; the French are there. One European Power, the Dutch, for many years the strongest of all, has now no place at all in Africa, though the Dutch race is perpetuated in the south, under English or Republican Government. On the other hand, the Germans, who, except for the few years when the Brandenburghers traded on the Guinea Coast, never had any footing in Africa, have lately taken a prominent position among the Europeans who are in so lordly a manner slicing up the continent. The Dutch were, above all others, a trading and carrying people. They went to Africa—at any rate, to West Africa—as carriers, and when the carrying trade over the Atlantic came to an end their connexions with West Africa gradually died away. Weak as Holland is when compared with Great Britain, or France, or Germany, she still holds her East Indian and West Indian possessions; but since West Africa has ceased to be what she once was, the scene of a series of depôts from which ships fetched human wares, she has left the Guinea Coast apparently for ever. Meanwhile, a new Power—Germany—has made its appearance. The Germans, no doubt, like all other peoples, look in their colonial enterprises to securing trade for the mother country; but they have taken their place in Africa under, and in full harmony with, the new set of conditions. They have come there as a continental people to a continent, not as a sea-going merchant people to a coast. They have come, not like the Prussians of old, to build and hold on sufferance small factories, but to rule, or claim to rule, to protect, or claim to protect, large areas of territory.

The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Scramble for Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this particularly apt and suggestive heading, the _Times_ published a few days ago an eminently opportune and important article.

Except that both undertakings sprang from a common spirit of commercial enterprise, the comparison is deceptive and misleading. The East India Company planted itself in countries already occupied by old civilisations, where the national intellect had been cultivated for untold ages, and commerce, with its attendant wealth, had long flourished; countries peopled by races inured to taxation, from whom large revenues could be raised without serious opposition. On the Niger there is no Pagoda-tree to be shaken with the accompanying showers of rupees. We do not, so far, raise from the natives one penny of direct revenue, the little we receive being indirectly through duties on the trade entering and leaving the country. Instead of vast populations with the inherited habit of labour, we have to deal for the most part with tribes ignorant, idle, and improvident, incapable of understanding, I need hardly say, not only the accumulation of wealth for future generations, but even the prudence of providing for their own sustenance during years of scarcity. They have not only to be taught how to work, but, what is more difficult, to be taught the habit of working.""\n\nWhile insisting on the potential wealth of Central Africa, I have dwelt on the obstacles in the way of its rapid development and on the absolute futility of an intermittent or spasmodic policy, because these points are essential to the main object of this article, which is to examine whether the existing movement in France is likely, within any period worth considering, to bring her settlements—for passing expeditions leave no results—into close contact and therefore possibly into collision with England in the Niger-Tchad basins. At the time of the conclusion of the late Anglo-French agreement, it was said that Lord Salisbury, far from having removed, *pro tanto*, the danger of conflict between the two nations, had given them a common frontier and had therefore actually created opportunities for disputes. I shall endeavour to show the fallacy of such reasoning by a short examination of the conditions which Lord Aberdare, in another speech delivered last July, summed up in the following words: ""Nature has placed between these spheres""—French and English—""formidable barriers, which could only be overcome by an initial expenditure out of all proportion to any probable returns for many years.""', 'last_edit_date': '1891-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND ENGLAND ON THE NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I must preface this article by two definitions. For want of a better concise name I shall use the vague term ""Central Africa"" to describe the more or less malarious portion of that continent lying between (say) the eighteenth parallels of north and south latitude, exclusive of the maritime regions within twenty or thirty miles of the seaboard, which can look to European fleets for protection of life and property. Central Africa, thus defined, is about thirty times the area of France, and fifty times that of the United Kingdom, and probably contains about one-twelfth of the population of the globe. In the second place, and for the same reason, I use the word ""England"" for ""Great Britain and Ireland,"" and ""Englishmen"" for the inhabitants of this country. ""Britain"" and ""Britons"" are, unfortunately, considered pedantic in prose.\n\nThe Anglo-German and Anglo-Portuguese agreements of 1890 have induced a colonial movement in France which, in this age of electricity, may be described as a strong secondary current. Competent authorities tell us that this agitation is no longer confined to colonial enthusiasts, but has penetrated into the mass of the nation; and a number of expeditions have lately been despatched from widely separated points of the African coast to extend French rights into the heart of the continent. The inadequate recognition in England of this movement may perhaps be attributed to a well-founded belief on the part of ""Our own Correspondents"" that the British public has lately had a surfeit of the Dark Continent.\n\nIt may seem illogical that the demarcation by other countries of spheres of influence in East and South Africa should affect the estimates which France had previously formed of the value of the regions bordering on her possessions in the north and west of the Continent; but it is not in France alone that the fever of annexation proves contagious. To this cause, principally, may be attributed the popularity of propositions for the immediate occupation of vast areas of Central Africa. Two minor causes have contributed to this movement. The first has been the downfall of the Boulangists, who had opposed colonial adventures; partly, no doubt, from a belief in the necessity of concentrating the forces of France at home, and, perhaps, partly from a desire to oppose any policy which had been adopted by their bête noire. Now M. Ferry, having recognised the hegemony of Germany in Europe, had, during his tenure of power, sought to direct the energies of France to compensations abroad.

The coast population have hitherto resented all attempts of Europeans to communicate with the natives of the interior, as the latter would thus be able to dispense with their services as middlemen. Lieutenants Kund and Tappenbeck met with serious resistance, and both were wounded some time ago as they were pushing their way inland: indeed, the latter has succumbed to his sufferings. However, the German Colonial Administration determined to push on reconnoitring expeditions. With this task Dr. Zuitgraff was intrusted, and since 1886 he has made five exhibitions to the coast region, collecting information which has enabled him to organise an expedition into the far interior. He met with many difficulties from the natives, who were hostile to European intrusion, but succeeded in reaching Yola, on the Binué, and in pushing to a considerable distance to the east. Dr. Zuitgraff described the results of his expedition at a recent meeting of the Berlin Geographical Society. He started first at Christmas 1887, and founded various stations in the interior.

The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Additionally, the articles mention the allocation of funds, noting that significant resources were directed towards police and prisons rather than education, which aligns with the claim of prioritizing control over cultural development. Furthermore, the articles criticize the lack of educational opportunities and the suppression of local customs and governance, indicating a disregard for cultural development. However, the articles also mention some efforts by colonial authorities to improve infrastructure and public services, which could be seen as attempts at development, albeit overshadowed by the overarching focus on control.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms. The Lugardian model was introduced into many British possessions and the mandated territories, and was also emulated by the Belgians in the Congo."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Regularized by a decree of 1924, it allowed any French administrator to impose a punishment of up to fifteen days gaol sentence and a fine for a series of infractions ranging from failure to pay taxes on time to displaying discourtesy to French officials.\nMore pervasive in effect than the legal systems were the personal taxes which all African males eventually encountered. Primarily designed as one means by which to make the colonial effort financially self-sustaining, they were also inspired by the notion that they would force the African into European economic enterprises and would extend the money economy.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context.

More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

Simensen has concluded, 'this Charter is probably the most detailed documentation that we have from the early period of colonial rule in the Gold Coast of an attempt by commoners to curtail the authority of the traditional elite and assert their own influence more effectively in the fields of jurisdiction and legislation.' 19 The second method adopted by the commoners of the rural areas was the destoolment (deposition) of their traditional rulers, and this became quite a common feature of rural politics in the Gold Coast in the inter-war period.

That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

It appears that the question to be discussed was that of the two letters which had been addressed to the Minister of the Colonies at the Hague; and the course adopted by the sapient Dutch Governor was not to elicit whether the charges brought against one of his so-called officers (qy., creatures?) had any foundation in fact, but to find out what unlucky wight had dared to write the letters for the people; because if nobody had dared to write these letters, the complaints of the people would never have reached Holland; and no awkward questions would have been asked. The King and his chiefs declined to give the names of the party whom they had employed to write their letters, saying, ""These letters have been read over again to us here in the castle, and they contain nothing more nor less than what we had to say, and we alone are responsible for their contents, and not the mechanical agent we employed to embody our ideas in civilized language."" The Dutch Governor would not listen to this argument at all; he must have the writer exposed and punished, for he was the real delinquent.\n\nThis is part and parcel of the blind Dutch policy. Some years ago the people of Bussima, in Ahanta, sent a petition to the Dutch Governor at Elmina, praying for a schoolmaster to be sent to instruct their children, and offered to pay his salary and give\n\nhim a residence, and provide a suitable schoolroom. The idea could not be entertained, because, said the then Governor, ""If we educate the natives, we shall ruin the country!""\n\nThe people were threatened with imprisonment, fire, and flames, and to have their town blown down about their ears, if they persisted in their refusal to give up the delinquent writer; because, said the Governor, ""The King of Holland has sent me out with a man-of-war to punish you, if you refuse me the names of the writers of these letters."" A scene ensued that baffles all description, and that to any other government, otherwise constituted than the present one at Elmina, would have been most humiliating.

But if it be so, we can only say that the Governor and his patrons have set up as imitators and followers of the worst of all examples. To tempt first, and afterwards to punish, is said to be the practice of the Arch-enemy of mankind. And here we have first, a demoralising and debasing system pursued year after year by the Sierra Leone Executive, under approval, of course; and then in due time comes forth the edict declaring the citizens to be incapable of discharging properly the duties of jurors. We utterly deny that they are so. To state it thus is to add insult to injury. But if it were so, who is to blame but the Executive, which mentally starves a whole people? We know of no greater cruelty or injustice than thus to impeach men with moral defects and delinquencies which could clearly be traced, if they did really exist, to the evil direction of the accuser. Surely if the object of all criminal law, and the machinery which it employs, be not merely to punish but to deter, Governor Blackall would find in the powerful instrumentality of education a more efficacious and Christian mode of attaining this desired end than that of the costly and immoral action of an exaggerated police force. The prophetic power of Pitt, the philanthropy of Wilberforce, the untiring energy and exertions of a Buxton and a Brougham, have expended themselves upon the social and moral advancement of Africa; and could some of them look from out their honoured graves, they would wonder that after eighty long years the lamp of knowledge should be so scantily supplied in their favoured regions, and brute force alone be in the ascendant. We grant that the latter, the rule of brute force, is the best a Government can adopt if it has determined that a people shall be kept in a low and debased state, or if, having once raised them to the dignity of citizens, it purposes to rob them by piecemeal of all that gives dignity to citizen life, and favours social advancement. Under the drowsy influence of universal ignorance, you may treat men as slaves, and in the fulness of time rob them of the sacred shield of the jury-box; but a wise and honest, above all a Christian Executive would shrink with horror from attempting to debase where it might elevate, or to take away where it is within its power justly to bestow. It is awful to think what must have been the state and condition at this time of Sierra Leone, if the noble Church and the Wesleyan Missionary Societies had not stepped in to the rescue of the people from ignorance and debasement. By and through their noble exertions there is an adequate number of citizens fit in every way for the duties and responsibilities of the jury-box, notwithstanding the disgraceful Government laches in the matter of education. But, as we have before urged, the time has come when this ought to cease. There are ample revenues now at Sierra Leone to enable the Executive to supply education to the people. Since the citizens have no power over the disposal of those revenues, they have but one course to pursue. Let them petition the Colonial-office, petition the British Parliament if necessary, either that some effective voice in the disposal of their money be given to them, or that the police should be reduced, education promoted, the jury-box preserved, the sanitary condition of the colony improved—in a word, that the proceeds of their duties and taxes should be spent for their social and commercial advancement as becomes a free people, and not in the exorbitant employment of brutalising influences, on worthless favourites, and unproductive follies.

The Governor had evidently received no good from his attendance at the four meetings immediately preceding the publication of his latest order. Carefully note the wording of this new law. Can anything be more peremptory or absolute, or more clearly show how desirous this man is to curtail the liberties and privileges of at least the Protestant portion of the public, which you know to be the bulk of the population of Santa Isabella? It is by command of the Governor. He does not even make the order in the name of his King; the King himself could not have been more peremptory. The man who has done this has also sent his men to forcibly take the keys of a man\'s safe and opening it, pay thereout a fine which he had inflicted. The same man also sent his people to go into a store and seize all the medicines in it (some of them having been ordered by a Government doctor and refused acceptance of), fining the owner of the store above 40l. for dealing in medicines, although they have been sold by all the stores ever since Europeans came to the island, and are a great boon to the public; but, ""I,"" the Governor, will not have it, and by virtue of the extraordinary discretionary powers with which ""I"" am entrusted, ""I"" seize and fine, and imprison, and transport. A mighty man is he (as the songs says of the blacksmith) in Fernando Po. But who is this mighty man, more powerful in his little sphere than King, or Emperor, or Czar? Outside this little island a very insignificant member of the ""great unknown"" These Governors come and go like comets, making a great stew and fuss whilst they last, and then disappear, never more to be heard of. Their reign is short and that is the only comfort we have when we get a bad one. But they are not all bad. We have had many good Governors, both military and naval, whose names are remembered with love and deep regard; but there were others whose base and evil dispositions have earned for them the maledictions of this most docile and tractable race of men. The system, however, of a two years\' governorship is a bad one. If we get a good earnest, sensible, far-seeing man, he is followed probably by one who is lazy, incapable, self-seeking and vain, with the result that he undoes all the good his predecessor has done. They are not long enough in office to take any real interest in their work. Little care have they for Fernando Po, so long as they draw their double pay, and turn their back on it when their term is ended; it is to the home Government that we must look for a remedy for these evils, which will some time become unendurable and end in violence. The Government has only to look at Cuba to see what official intolerance and disregard for the liberties of the people have done. A civil Governor, and one who knows something of the art of governing, as well as of the means best calculated to encourage agriculture and commerce, one with broad and liberal views of men and things in general, and who is willing to receive sound advice from those he has to govern—is the man wanted here; and he should be appointed for a term of five years. Compare the prosperous condition of the British Colonies along this Coast with the present condition of things here, and then let the Government ask what is the cause of it. The reason is not far to seek, in spite of the disadvantages of heavy duties levied in the British Colonies; and we shall have no improvement until the property and rights of the people here are made more secure from outrage, and a greater regard is shown for their convictions and privileges. As to the present Governor, it is suggested that those who have suffered through his injustice should band together and appeal for redress—legal redress—through the courts-of-law in Spain. A few hundred pounds would be well spent in bringing prominently before the Spanish public the doings of their irresponsible servants here, and would undoubtedly obtain the attention of the Spanish Government thereto.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RECENT REVOLT IN THE CAMEROONS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In connexion with the recent meeting of the Native police against the German authority in the Cameroons, very serious charges have been made against some of the highest officials in the Colony.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental.

The court was held by two military officers of the garrison. The King was arraigned as a criminal, and although the charge of unnecessary cruelty was not proved, he was subjected to a severe and unnecessary reprimand, with a warning that if another case be brought against him he should be punished as a common malefactor.

This code regulates criminal procedure, and specifies punishment for offences occurring in the relations of Europeans and native races. The Court of Appeal is fixed at Boma, and Courts of first instance will be established at other places as necessity dictates. As regards the composition of the Court, it is made up of a magistrate appointed by the King, and a public prosecutor appointed by the resident Administrator-General. It was not advisable to provide for jury trial in the new State, but in cases involving the penalties of death or penal servitude, assessors will sit on the bench. A list of the leading residents, public servants, officers, and merchants, will be drawn up by the Administrator-General, and assessors will be drawn by lot from this list. In the Courts of first instance two will sit, and in the Court of Appeal four. There will be no difference between them and the magistrate while they are on the bench, the code not distinguishing between the verdict and the sentence, which will be rendered by the majority. If there is an equal division, the prisoner will be acquitted. Both prisoner and public prosecutor can appeal. The decree does not interfere with the native jurisdiction in offences between natives unless a European interest is involved. Thus only in three cases will the natives be amenable to European justice, viz.: 1. Where the offence causes a prejudice to a non-native or the State. 2. Where it is committed in a State establishment, or in the house or establishment of a non-native, or within a kilometre of such establishments. 3. Where it is connected with an offence imputed to a non-native. One of the first acts of the Financial Department has been to lay down the rules governing the acquisition of land in the new State.

It also provided that all non-occupied territory belonged to the State, and forbade the dispossession of natives.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The articles also highlight the protection of negligent officials like Admiral Patey and the lack of accountability for misconduct, as seen in the case of Dr. Peters. Additionally, they discuss economic exploitation, such as the imposition of taxes and prioritization of trade interests over local welfare.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.73, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones.

The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

Where it is intended as an instrument of tyranny, there, of course, the thing is simple enough; but where there is no such intention, we are at a loss to conceive how any reasonable person can for a moment suppose that one man, called a judge, or assessor, or what you please, will be more systematically honest, upright, and unprejudiced, than twelve men as jurors—the judge being a permanent one, the jurors a varying many. On the very face of it, such a supposition is absurd; even in countries with open courts, watchful reporters, published evidence, and a bold and honest daily press, the experiment must be an unsafe one; but in those where such checks and safeguards either do not exist at all, or exist in a very imperfect state, it can only be looked upon as unmitigatedly bad. And of all countries in which to introduce it—not, be it observed, as a first effort toward the regular administration of justice, but as an institution founded on the ruins of a wantonly-destroyed jury system—those of Western Africa are about the last in which any good could be hoped from it. Why, the influences are so adverse there, that one might as well expect to get delicious fruit from a tender peach-tree planted among the ice and snow at the North Pole. It must, necessarily, have to contend in the colonies and settlements on the West Coast against both the demoralizing influences of tradition, and those in vigorous, open activity. It ought, then, to be no matter for wonder that the administration of justice on the West Coast now occupies much of our space and attention. The vital interests of all classes there, except the official one, are mixed up with this question. Since the abolition of trial by jury in civil causes, the fortunes, and liberty, and it may be lives of suitors are at the mercy of judges who are surrounded by influences, and placed there under circumstances, which continually war against the exercise of a free, honest, upright, unbiassed judgment. Men are sent out there from Great Britain with salaries of some 600l. a-year, one-half or two-thirds of which they feel it right to spend in life insurance for the benefit of their families or creditors in the event of their premature decease. They may be said, therefore, to be sent out with real salaries of 200l. or 300l. a-year to places where living is dear for persons of European habits—to places where officials are all expected to hold together, whether right or wrong—to places where the most prominent residents exercise a large hospitality very convenient for officials of small incomes, and where to serve one\'s friends and to ""come down upon one\'s enemies"" is considered to be a matter of course. Is it any wonder, then, that in such places a losing party in a suit should keenly scrutinize every circumstance that it may be supposed could possibly have had an influence in the decision? And where this is continually going on, can there be any real respect felt for the so-called administration of justice? We have been compelled to bring again before our readers the case of Good v. Finlayson, which has been partially exposed in our two last numbers. We said in our last that the evidence was in our hands, but in consequence of the difficulties placed in the way of obtaining an official copy from the Court, the judgment as recorded did not reach us till the present month. Our space would not allow of our publishing all the evidence; but this is quite unimportant, because the charge of publication of the alleged libel being admitted, and justification pleaded, the whole case turned upon the point of whether the plaintiff\'s first wife was alive when he remarried. The only attempted proof of her death was a letter purporting to come from one Caroline Morris, of Boston, United States of America, but bearing only the post-mark of Sierra Leone, in which it was stated that the wife died in her house. Now this letter, though received in evidence, was not impounded by the Court, so that we cannot examine it. But this is of no consequence. Sir William Hackett, the then judge, examined it, and (we are guaranteed that every word sent to us on this subject is exactly correct) said it brought no conviction to his mind; it was worth nothing at all (see page ). It is quite clear from this that if Sir William Hackett had then charged the jury, he would have laid down that there was no case, and that they must find for the defendant. The defendant seems not to have asked for that decision, because he expected a witness to arrive on the Coast who could prove the plaintiff\'s first wife to be still alive. But the onus of this proof did not rest on him, because that of the proof of death rested on the plaintiff. The cause stood adjourned sine die. Sir William Hackett is shortly after removed and promoted. Soon, Governor Blackall\'s conspiracy against the rights and liberties of the people is crowned with success, and juries in civil causes are abolished. The office of Judge of the Supreme Court, held by Hackett, is also abolished. A new order of things is established.

I drew attention to the fact that the wife of this Mr. Evans was trading for a produce which was and is largely purchased for cash, and, without making any direct charge, I called attention to the fact that some of this cash so received for Post-office orders might be employed in trade, and that the result might be a deficiency to the prejudice of the public. The fact of the insufficiency of Mr. Evans\'s securities was, I am informed, brought officially before the notice of Admiral Patey during the period he so unhappily maladministered the government of this colony; but Mr. Evans was one of his protégés, and he pigeon-holed the communication relative to this important matter. The result was, Mr. Evans\'s securities were not renewed, nor the question of the position of the surviving one looked into. In May last the Postmaster dies, his affairs are found to be in a mess, and the Post-office authorities in London find out at last that he is a defaulter to the sum of 800l. and more. Such being the case, naturally one should suppose that this deficiency would be charged to Admiral Patey. This, however, is not to be the case, I hear; but, on the contrary, the deficiency caused by the gross neglect of Admiral Patey and other officials is to be charged against the revenue of the Colonial Government of the Gambia! In fact, the unfortunate taxpayers have to make good the peculations of a dishonest official, whose honesty was supposed to be guaranteed by good and solvent securities.\n\nA poor humble individual, I ask the Colonial Minister, the Right Hon. Earl Kimberley, *is this right, is this fair?* I ask Sir A. Kennedy, the Governor-in-Chief of the West African Settlements, if he can, whilst Admiral Patey is promoted to another Colony, where he is in the receipt of a good income, allow the Gambia to be mulcted in this way, whilst the real author and cause of the deficiency, Admiral Patey, is allowed to escape without being called upon to make good the deficiency.

""Very bad man, sar, Englishman, drink too much whisky, take all poor negro money, get drunk, go back to England; bad man, Englishman. I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

Where the people have achieved and secured for themselves an adequate representation in the government, or have had this wisely conferred upon them, this debt of government to its subjects is pretty certain of being paid; and where it is not so paid, the people are, then, parties to their own wrong.

The subjects of this injustice did nothing, but the tyrants deem it necessary to maintain their own power to flog and fine innocent slaves. On the 3rd inst., the masked men went out, scattered the market, and seized much goods belonging to the poor people, which they took away. The tyrants in town, Orok and the three Archibong, got a missionary to their own liking to hold a meeting once a week in their yard. The first good result of this meeting was the issuing of a proclamation that all the dogs in town must be killed, because they spoil Orok\'s ju-ju. As our brave missionary said in church on the following Sabbath, ""The poor ignorant heathens in town sacrificed many dogs last week to devils."" The tyrants do not like Mr. Ross; they hate him as much as Ahab did Micaiah. After the meeting was over in Orok\'s yard, and the missionary away, he at once sacrificed fowls to his ju-ju. Archibong Ezo, son of Archibong II., not long ago flogged a woman to death. Archibong Adam, son of late Archibong III., flogged a boy most barbarously, and when the poor fellow was gasping most piteously, he threw him into the mangrove swamp, to be devoured by crocodiles. There is a respectable young man in town, of some property; the three Archibong boys, including the two murderers, put him in chains, and demanded all his people and property. The plea set up for this iniquitous demand was, that Okom Ma traded seventeen years for Archibong II., and six years for Archibong III., for which he never received any wages. This is a strange reward. The judges met to consider the matter, and allowed the boys to have the palaver all their own way. Okom Ma has appealed to Consul Hewett.

PETERS,** a brief _résumé_ of which we give on another page, is but unpleasant reading for those optimists who look for immediate advantage to Africa and her people from the recent great spread of Colonial enterprise on the part of the chief European nations. Dr. Peters was the representative of German Imperial authority within the limits of what is known as German East Africa, and as such he was entrusted with extraordinary powers, including that of life and death over the Natives, within the limits of his jurisdiction. It stands to reason that the authority he thus wielded was conferred upon him solely for the furtherance of civilisation, and the enforcement of submission to the laws promulgated by the central authority in Berlin; but Dr. Peters stands convicted on the clearest possible evidence of having taken advantage of his official position to further his own private ends, and to wreak his vengeance upon certain of the Natives who had offended him in a manner that was devoid of all legality, and only calculated to bring German authority in his district into contempt and loathing. No doubt one great difficulty in the way of steadily building up a prosperous and respected Colonial government, in a region so far removed from the centre of administrative authority, is the fact that it is necessary to entrust in the hands of one man such immense powers as are not granted in districts more readily subject to official oversight without being safeguarded in a way that is not possible in these more remote situations; and the temptation that such official is under to forget the purpose for which this immense authority is delegated to him, and to put in force his supreme powers to accomplish a purpose for which they were never intended. The Germans seem to have been particularly unfortunate in the persons to whom this great trust has been committed—witness the case of Herr Last in the Cameroons, and now that of Dr. Peters in the East. It cannot be said that the punishment meted out in either of these cases partakes of the demerit of undue severity; no doubt the disgrace of Dr. Peters in being so ignominiously dismissed from the Imperial service, judged from a purely moral standpoint, is heavy enough; but a man proved guilty of such abominable cruelty to Natives who were entrusted to his keeping would not receive much sympathy even if some of that material punishment were meted out to him which he showed himself so ready to inflict upon others. At the same time great credit is due to the Berlin authorities for the readiness they have shown, in both these cases, in bringing to trial, and subsequent conviction and punishment, even their highest colonial officials, for such gross perversion of the powers entrusted to them for the benefit of those under them and the credit of the German Empire; and we can only hope that these proceedings will serve as a warning to other European officials in barbarous and semi-civilised districts, and cause them to be more careful in the future as to their conduct towards those committed to their charge, seeing that punishment, ""though she moves with a club foot,"" will overtake them sooner or later.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there. The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired.

One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended.

It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

Mr. Fynn permitted Colonel Foster to make diligent search over all his premises, and finding that the papers required were not in Mr. F.\'s possession, the Colonel said: ""Mr. Fynn, I am satisfied. When I go to Government House I shall inform his Excellency that you have no \'Mackessim papers\' with you."" The Colonel then left. Whether the Colonel made such a report to the Administrator or not there is no knowing; but there is the fact that between six and seven P.M. (some five or six hours after the Colonel had searched Mr. Fynn\'s house and expressed himself satisfied thereat), one Corporal Pratt, of the police force, with four or five other policemen, entered Mr. Fynn\'s house with the self-same warrant that had been already executed by Colonel Foster. Pratt told Mr. Fynn that the Colonel had sent him with the warrant to remove all Mr. Fynn\'s papers. At this time Corporal Pratt, as was proved in evidence, was a little the worse for liquor. Mr. Fynn told Corporal Pratt that he must be mistaken, as the Colonel himself had already searched all his papers. Mr. Fynn\'s brother and a nephew of his asked to look at the warrant. At this Pratt produced two warrants; one was the one that Colonel Foster had personally executed, the other was another which Colonel Foster had issued ""by express orders of his Excellency,"" and signed by his Excellency as well as Colonel Foster. (This last warrant at the trial was non est). Pratt would not allow sufficient time to the gentlemen to read them, snatched the warrants away from them, and walked out of the house; he was called back three or four times, but refused to return. It appears he went direct to the Colonel and informed him that Mr. Fynn had resisted, and obstructed him in the performance of his duty. Corporal Pratt did not give the information on oath, as Colonel Foster was satisfied on his bare assertion. On this the Colonel, at about eleven P.M., with about twenty or thirty policemen, proceeds to Mr. Fynn\'s house, stations policemen at all the entrances, walks upstairs, and enters most unceremoniously into Mr. F.\'s bedroom, without knocking at the door or giving any notice of his presence in the house. Mr. F. at this time was asleep. Mr. F. was sitting on the bed, trying to lull to sleep her babe; two other children, a boy and a girl, being asleep on a country mat in front of the bed. What does the gallant Colonel do? Shocking to relate (one\'s blood boils at the recollection of the outrage), he turns over the mat on which the poor children are asleep with his dirty boots, kicks the girl on the face so severely that the marks left by it are visible some three or four weeks after; walks up to the bed on which Mr. F. is lying, seizes him by the hand, and says, in a husky tone (the effect of drink), ""Come, get up. I will not treat you as a gentleman on this occasion. I will not treat you as I did this morning""; forces poor Fynn out of bed, compels him to give up all his private documents, &c., and when Fynn asked to be permitted to accompany him, so as to be present at the examination, orders him to bed. At this stage of the proceedings one Mr. Thomas Forson appears on the scene, and, being a friend of Fynn\'s, asks the Colonel to permit him to accompany him to Government House, to be present at the inspection of the papers. The Colonel declined, and walked away, giving orders for the apprehension of Mr. Fynn and his son. They were consequently carried off to prison. Shortly after this Mr. Forson and three other friends proceed to the Colonel\'s residence to bail out Fynn and son; the Colonel orders the police to turn them out. The scene was so amusing that Forson could not help laughing; whereat the Colonel turns round, and says to him (these are the Colonel\'s own words as he stated them in evidence), ""Come along, my chattering friend, you are the very man I want,"" and hands him over to the police, who without more ado walk him off to keep Fynn and son company.

Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good.

On its own part the United States govern› ment expressed 'profound shock' at the 'shocking suppression of the natives' revealed in the Report.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers.

These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did.

In January 1932 the Brunot Commission also presented its Report to the League.

Traditional African communal labour was to replace forced labour for public works; the indigenous Liberians were to be granted an undisputed ownership of their lands, the authority and dignity of the African chiefs were to be upheld by the Liberian government, and the education of the indigenous Liberians and the means of communication with the Liberian hinterland were to be improved.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions.

They also requested the release of Harry Thuku, and asked for an appointment of a paramount chief'with judicial powers for trying our cases, one who should be well educated and to be elected by the majority of our people'. The petition also dealt with the local problems that the colonial administration created for the people, such as the compulsory rebuilding of sanitary huts to prevent plague and the banning of the growing of cotton and coffee by Africans. Finally, it put forward programmes for improvement, asking the administration to expand the training facilities for hospital orderlies, for the building of a high school, and for the setting up of a school for girls. These requests made little impression on the colonial authorities.\nBut official scorn did not deter these leaders. By 1927 something of a rapprochement was made with the Kiambu politicians, when Jomo Kenyatta was asked by the Association to take over the post of general secretary, a job which he took up the following year.\nThe fortunes of the KCA improved in the following two years for reasons both local and international. Kenyatta's efforts as party secretary led to a cultural revival. In his efforts to build up grass-roots support for the Association, Kenyatta appealed to the Gikuyu through Mwigwithania, a Gikuyu-language newspaper he founded, to be proud of their cultural heritage. The pages of the monthly Mwigwithania were full of riddles, proverbs and stories which encouraged the readers to think of themselves as Gikuyu. This paper also narrated the day-to-day activities of the KCA in detail, thus bringing it to the attention of the readers.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

We have before alluded to the composition of the Legislative Council—a Council composed of four commercial agents of one London firm. In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

It is thus, where there is no organ of public opinion, that evils and abuses grow and abound, until they attain to an offensive turpitude that renders it impossible for them to be longer concealed. And then they come upon the world like the pestilential vapour of some rotten marsh, where the poison has loaded a dead atmosphere, which becomes at last overcharged.

I can only say, as Mr. Fechter says in the play of ""The Duke\'s Motto,"" ""I am here.""\n\nI must thank ""Cape Coast""—and I do so heartily—for his estimation of my skill in unwinding tangled skeins of official thread, but I am sadly afraid that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has at his call more men of high mental attainments and of singular administrative acuteness than my good friend in Africa dreams of; and I am as sadly afraid that the day is far off indeed when I shall be invoked to mend the ways of a Government which is, without exception, the most difficult in the gift of the Crown. Were I as wise as the serpent and as long-suffering as Job, the Government of the Gold Coast would still exhaust my experience, and would overtax my patience too.\n\nI have been provoked to the expression of an opinion. I think, then, that the tangible faults of the Government of the Gold Coast are these:—\n\n1. The changes of the governors are too frequent. The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'OFFICE DISCIPLINE IN THE GOLD COAST COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is reported that some of the clerks in Christiansburgh Castle were very recently the recipients of outrageous usage.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

But at the same time we must say that if, under any circumstances, a departure be, as it undoubtedly is, justifiable, it will always in our opinion be particularly so where the misconduct is of a nature to endanger human life: and that hospital question has been forced upon us month by month for a very long period, and has from time to time been hinted at by us.

W. Holland, we see his decision was overruled, and his conduct severely censured, by his own Government,—so much so, that his decision was quite reversed, and Mr. Holland allowed to return and resume his duties, after being expelled from the colony.

The arrangement of such authority was asymmetrical, no matter how little existing institutions were modified or subsumed to European needs. At the pinnacle of the administrative system stood the governor or residentgeneral who, while ultimately responsible to his national government, frequently enjoyed the powers of a sovereign.\nThe institutional framework within which he acted varied considerably in size and complexity, but he was usually assisted in the inter-war period by some form of consultative council or commercial interests. The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa. The continued use of this military term was a reminder of the nature of colonial acquisitions. Over the cercle, a European administrator exercised colonial authority and directed both the activities of his European subordinates and the African authorities enlisted in the colonial administration."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

In large measure, colonial rule ultimately collapsed in Africa because of the declining ability - a combined financial, military, and moral condition of Europeans to continue it in the face of African nationalist pressure. Yet within the terminal decade of colonialism, the pre-established methods of control were influential in determining the process of change. The administrative matters of identity and differentiation and of centralization and local autonomy then became effective determinants. The smoothest transmission of power, as will be seen in the concluding volume of this History, was that accomplished through the English 'Westminster system', the outgrowth of the colonial legislative councils through which methods of political opposition were developed, as is most evident in the independence of the Gold Coast as Ghana. The most radical change was that which occurred in French Algeria and, more recently, in the Portuguese settler colonies of Angola and Mozambique, where the assimilationist approach held that these areas were overseas extensions of the national state.\nDiversity of colonial method was not as important historically as was the similarity in assessment of the colonial situation. Despite the pronouncements enshrined in the documents of the League of Nations, and in defiance of their weakened global positions as a result of the World War, the European powers in Africa did not entertain thoughts of political devolution in the inter-war period. Egypt excepted, Africa was seen as the one continent in which colonialism would be of very long duration, and colonial methods were all designed to accommodate European interests and intentions. Therefore, the essential political activity was one of African adjustment to European objectives, regardless of whether the particular colonial practice followed was indirect or not.\nMost important of all the historical developments of the inter-war period, the colonial system established the general administrative framework in which national government would be housed in the first decade of independence.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority. In the words of K. Arhin and J. Ki-Zerbo describing the Voltaic regions: During the nineteenth century, political instability and population movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority... Some notable exceptions notwithstanding, the frequency and extent of these conflicts grew and the tendency towards social dislocation was undoubtedly linked with the growing opportunities available to the peripheral powers and the rebels to obtain arms and use them to challenge the reigning chiefs. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples. In the case of the Aro, it was the widespread influence of a set of oracles, managed through a network of Aro colonies and local 'secret societies', that provided a judicial and economic basis of integration over a wide section of Igboland.

In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage. The present system is a great injustice to Sierra Leone, and it is high time that it should be remedied.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Much must be left to the Commissioner’s tact and discretion. A body of Haussas are now being enlisted for the police service, and in time we may hope that the law will reach well into the interior, and that free traffic will be carried on without the intervention of middlemen. The numerous creeks and rivers form useful waterways, though they are hotbeds of malaria. It will be the business of the Commissioner and his staff, moreover, to encourage and even carry on experiments in the way of introducing new cultures and new industries. Major MacDonald has been in communication with Kew and with Sir Alfred Moloney, who has done such good work in Lagos. He will take out with him a large supply of seeds of various kinds, and begin by establishing an experimental garden at Old Calabar.\n\nMajor MacDonald’s own head-quarters will be at Old Calabar, where there is some kind of Consular building. But, of course, he will be pretty constantly on the move. His Vice-Consuls will be stationed as follows: General Hammill on the Bonny River; Mr. T. A. Wall at Old Calabar; Captain H. L.

One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'Literature in European languages', 'content': ""The early 'parliamentarians' - the nominees, the assimilØs of French administration, the spokesmen of the masses approved by the British system as members of the so-called legislative councils - utilized the tongue of the alien ruler to destroy his illusions over what he had presumed were captive colonial executives.

If the articles given were simply worthless but harmless gew-gaws in exchange for articles of value, the morality of the transaction would even be reprehensible, but how much more when the articles are not only of trifling value ... but often positively destructive. They take home that which builds them up in wealth, often leaving to the African that which im› poverishes and destroys him. It is a sad reflection that, in many cases, European commerce has left its African customer as naked as it found him ... they will never secure a footing in Africa for their ideas of civilization, until the commercial relations between the high-toned, enlightened European and the 'savage' African, are placed upon a more equitable basis. But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'. You must, he wrote, 'educate him [the African] by himself. The annals of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society of the Gold Coast in the 1910s and 1920s, notably the speeches of J. E.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger delta and the Cameroon region', 'section_title': 'The Cameroon coast and its hinterland 14', 'content': ""British interest in the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of legitimate trade led to treaties and the gradual loss of the sovereignty of the local rulers. Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

If Sierra Leone and other parts of the Coast would undertake to guarantee a sufficient sum—say in all from 500l. to 600l. a-year—such an agency could at once be attempted, and the amount of good that would arise from it can only be judged by what was effected in other colonies.\n\nI have only to suggest the above for the consideration of those on that unfortunate Coast, in which I have always taken the liveliest interest.—Yours, &c.,'}, {'id': 3591, 'article_title': 'Calculated Falsehoods About Liberia', 'full_section_title': 'Calculated Falsehoods About Liberia', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1878#article-13', 'issue_date': '01_05_1878', 'content': 'There has been an evil spirit at work for many years past, bringing ridicule upon the Republic of Liberia, by obtaining the insertion in the English newspapers of exaggerated statements respecting her. That same spirit is still at work. Under some form, varying from time to time, it has carried on its operations, for the personal benefit of some few individuals, from the period at which dear old Gerald Ralston, who laboured so zealously and so disinterestedly for Liberia, ceased to be her Consul-General in Great Britain. He threw around her poverty (how could she be other than poor?) a halo of respectability which gained for her warm and generous sympathies. The evil spirit has robbed her in great measure of these, and given her, instead thereof, shame and reproach, which are not the less keen and bitter because she does not deserve them. To the machinery which it employed Liberia is under obligation for that public loan, the proceeds of which, spent or intercepted for the most part by her false friends, have left her with a debt of which she is not able at present to pay either interest or principal, and with the odium that necessarily attaches to such impecuniosity. It is a very poor compensation to the Republic that she was toasted and extolled with disgusting inflation at so-called public banquets, which were puffed in newspapers for the self-glorification and other personal advantage of the promoters. For the sake of Liberia we had hoped that all this was at an end. But we were mistaken. We had not adequately estimated the vitality and Protean power of the spirit in question. A few days since we came upon the following in one of the public prints: ""It is said that application is to be made to the United States Congress this Session for a grant of $60,000 for the survey of a line of railway from Liberia to the interior of Africa. The object of this scheme is said to be the opening of the Soudan to civilization and commerce. Owing to the extensive purchasing and leasing of lands by the Liberia Coffee Estates Company and others during the past year, the value of land in Liberia has greatly increased, and the facility of a railway into the interior would be of unspeakable value to the Republic."" The spirit now goes about incognito. It comes upon us with a modest and retiring ""it is said."" But the destructive venom is there, and we feel that it is our duty to extract it. We see a great future for Liberia in her coffee industry. The plant with which a bounteous Nature has endowed her is a valuable one, because of its prolific and hardy properties. It has obtained a wide reputation, and we take a deep interest in it, and would not have ridicule thrown upon it, as it was thrown upon the revenue and monetary resources of the Republic, by a defaming exaggeration. We think we know something about what is going on in Liberia, but we certainly have not heard of any Liberia Coffee Estates Company, with any capital to buy up such quantities of the wide-spread public lands of Liberia as to ""greatly increase the value"" of what is so abundant. The only thing we have heard of, of which we do not know the name, is that some small drafts that were drawn by order in Monrovia on England, as payment for a transferred lease of a few acres, were returned to Liberia dishonoured. And then, as to the introduction—the preface of this astounding announcement of the great increase in the value of lands in Liberia. Somebody is to make a bogus motion in the United States Congress for a grant of $50,000 for the survey of a line of railway from Liberia to the interior of Africa. Liberia has what is looked upon as an illimitable stretch of territory from the sea-coast toward the interior. She has, however, at present only some 16,000 or 17,000 of population really termed Liberians, who are either emigrants from, or the descendants of emigrants from, the United States, although she has a large aboriginal population, which, when civilized, will be a source of great wealth and power to the Republic. She has not really any common public roads worthy the name. Her farm settlements are on the banks of her rivers, and those rivers afford all the facilities of transport that she at present requires. She could not maintain 100 miles of good ordinary road, much less railroad, if she had them. The whole announcement is a bit of superlative nonsense, if it has not some evil aim; and we should not have noticed it but that we are anxious to see an end of that abominable procession of lies which has made Liberia a laughing-stock among all who know something of, and do not love, Africa and her people, and been a cause of pain to those who do earnestly desire to see her countries march steadily in the track of civilization and Christianity to developed productiveness and wealth. What Liberia has need of is capital, and an increase of civilized industrial population; and when she has these, she will no doubt gradually spread out her arms toward the interior. She wants, too, after all that has happened concerning her and her representatives in England, to have some one of established reputation here to speak with authority in her name, and who may be applied to with confidence in such matters as this of the wonderfully increased value of her lands through the operations of some extremely wealthy company, which we can only at present think of as about as mythical as is the greatly increased value which it is said to have induced.'}, {'id': 3699, 'article_title': 'WHAT SHOULD NOW BE DONE?', 'full_section_title': 'WHAT SHOULD NOW BE DONE?', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_01_1879', 'content': ""\n\nWe must be excused in repeating that they cannot be so represented for a smaller sum than 300l. to 400l. a-year.

Young, Secretary to the Colonial Institute, in a paper read by him at Amsterdam) of a very important section of gentlemen, intimately connected with the British Colonies, who hold that the federation of Great Britain with her Colonies, is now the only safe and legitimate course for the mother country to pursue. It is not our purpose here, to examine and criticise either the principle or the plan of a federation such as Mr. Young purposes and advocates. All that we would say at present is, that we are not a convert to his theory; which, if our impression be correct, could never be reduced to practice, or work even if so reduced. Nor do we intend to put forward any counter proposition in stating what has long been in our mind as likely to be conducive to a continued understanding between the mother country and her colonies; and to such an acquaintance by the former, with the wants and wishes and interests of the latter, as could not fail to establish a mutual sympathy that has not hitherto existed, and that would diminish, if it did not entirely put an end to, that Imperial egotism of which we treated in our last number. What has been in our mind is, a Colonial Parliament to sit in London, for discussing and bringing before the Imperial Parliament and Her Majesty Government, the varied and in many cases vital interests of the Colonies, so as to obtain the co-operation and action of Her Majesty's Government for the attainment of objects which, in the absence of such enlightenment by the Colonial Parliament, it might overlook or disregard, to the great injury and prejudice of the Colonies. We feel certain that were there such a Colonial Parliament, sitting in London, some basis of agreement between the mother country and her Australian Colonies, respecting desired annexations, would soon be arrived at. Nor are we less certain that if such a Colonial Parliament had existed, Porto Novo would long since have been annexed to Lagos, instead of having been allowed to fall into French possession; that the sea board between the present British trans-Volta countries and Dahomey, would also have been incorporated, as is their desire, with the Gold Coast Colony; and that railroad construction, by or under the auspices of Government, would long ere this have been commenced in that Colony. The sympathy existing among colonies, in face of the mother country, would lead to a mutual understanding and enforcement upon objects in which each separate colony—that might be relied upon as best to understand its own wants—was interested. Action undertaken by the Imperial Government, at the instance of such a Colonial Parliament, could not and would not be any longer stigmatized as proceeding from earth greed on the part of the mother country, which really does not, and would not in any instance, obtain any pecuniary advantage, any addition to imperial revenue, by the fruits of such action, the Colony alone being the gainers. My present purpose being only to emit the idea of such a Parliament, composed of representatives sent to London by the Colonies, I do not enter upon the subject of the number of representatives from each Colony to this Parliamentary Chamber, the mode of election, the remuneration, and the source from which this should be derived. Let the principle be admitted, these important subsidiary questions would soon be settled. But, with regard to West Africa, as every colony or settlement, however small, should have representation, there would certainly be a representative of Lagos, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia; and, as we have before stated, it is not unreasonable to suppose that these would obtain sympathy from the comparatively gigantic Canada, the Cape, the Australias, and others, who in their infancy were Crown Colonies, and as such encountered, in the Imperial Government, all the hindrances to progress and development, of which the poor West African Colonies have had, and still have so much reason to complain. Large sums are paid to officials, for the most part European, there is a considerable and costly Government staff; but, beyond the enforcement of public order, nothing is done to hasten the development of the great resources of the Colony. We honestly believe that, in the not distant future, it will be deplored that the British Government took so little real interest in West African affairs. It has, of course, conferred immense benefit by putting an end to the atrocities of superstitious rule and customs, to tribal wars, and finally to slavery; thus laying the foundations of civilization, and by giving assured protection to Christian missionaries, facilitating the spread of those divine truths, the heart-felt reception and influence of which ennobles and refines humanity. Under its aegis, too, facilities for trade and commerce have been supplied by European capital and enterprise. But by direct action, such as the opening up of roads, and the supply of other material aids to progress and development, it has done nothing; while its officials have but too generally exercised an influence in the opposite direction.

But it should be remembered in that elevated sphere that, although the British Government authorities have almost entirely ignored the subject of Education, and that, if it had depended solely on them, the people of the British West Coast Settlements would at the present time be almost as ignorant as were their forefathers at the time when the Foreign Slave Trade was finally suppressed on the West African Coasts, other agencies have been steadily at work; that the Church and Wesleyan Missionary Societies have been educating the people, many of whom, also, through success in trading enterprise, have been able to obtain for themselves and their offspring the advantages of British culture in England and Scotland. And again, that, although so many abuses have been corrected, the old leaven of irresponsibility from which they spring, still remains; and that, although the public exhibition of its fruits—licentiousness, favouritism, and tyranny—has been in some measure restrained, that fruit still grows, and adds a new taint to the foul moral atmosphere of the Settlements. The letters and papers from the West Coast which we have from time to time published, and which we select from a host of such documents, show that a constant censorial vigilance over Administrative acts and conduct is still imperatively necessary, if those Settlements are to be pushed forward on the road of civilization. We have had occasion in late numbers of this journal to expose and comment upon the so-called administration of justice there. Our Lagos letters in this August number reopen the question, and expose a system of abuse of the forms of justice that arouses in us a strong feeling of indignation. We are jealous for the true fame of Great Britain. We would have our country sans peur et sans reproche; and it grieves our heart when we see that those who are entrusted with executive and legal powers abuse these in the shameful manner we have had and now again have to expose. Look at the picture shown by our Lagos correspondent. We have in a recent number called upon the Secretary of State for the Colonies to limit the powers of Queen’s Advocates on the West Coast, to pay them an adequate salary, and to prohibit their appearing before the Courts as counsel in any but criminal cases where the prosecution really is by the Executive authorities. If this reform be not effected the stream of justice will continue to be poisoned at its source, and instead of being a purifying will be a poisonous and corrupting one. There are now in all the Settlements barristers-at-law who have been legally educated and taken their degrees in England, and the field of private practice ought to be left open entirely for these educated Africans, who in not a few instances have given proof of high ability and of legal knowledge fully on a par with the majority of Europeans who accept legal and judiciary functions in those countries. Then again, it has become quite time that what are called “local-made solicitors,” should be dispensed with. These self-constituted lawyers were perhaps necessary before young Africans legally educated in England went out to the Coast to practise. We have said perhaps the self-constituted lawyers, to whom renewable certificates were eventually given, might have been necessary, although we have had but too ample evidence from the Coast of the venality of most of these men, and of the shamelessness with which they plundered, and, when it could be made to their advantage, sold their clients. But whatever necessity, real or fancied, may have existed in the past, there can be no longer any need of the employment of those semi-legal bloodsuckers. We say without hesitation that certificates to these men should no longer be renewed. The employment by one of them in Lagos as clerk and interpreter (see letter, “Public Opinion”) of a man who has been notorious for fraud, and more than once convicted of felony, is a scandalous insult to the population among whom he is thus authorized and allowed to “practise.” This is a matter that should be looked to by the local authorities; while the limitation of the powers of Queen’s Advocates, who frequently become acting judges during the absence on leave of occupants of the Bench, ought to be without delay effected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But it is not alone in the administration of justice that gross abuses exist. The Executive fails in its obvious duty on many points. We shall only mention one or two here, although their name is legion, and in this we confine ourselves still to Lagos. How often have we pointed out that Lagos should be a focus of civilization, whence precept and example should act on the intelligent barbarism of the Egba and Yoruba countries; and how greatly we have had to deplore that such civilizing influence has never yet been exerted. And we can scarcely now hope that within our time it will be exerted. We had hoped, too, that the publication of a well-conducted paper in Lagos, the Lagos Times, would have given a voice to public opinion sufficiently strong to lead to the correction of such abuses as that which has been strongly brought before us of the neglect to light the streets of Lagos. Well-lighted streets would constitute a difference between Lagos and the interior heathen towns that every visitor from the interior would see, and would speedily appreciate. And yet such is the culpable lethargy of the Executive, in or over which the educated native public of Lagos has no power, that, although the lamps and appliances for adequately lighting Lagos throughout have been procured and do exist, no lighting takes place except in the immediate neighbourhood of Government House and the adjoining residences of some principal officials and merchants. This is a scandalous remissness on the part of the Executive, and the more scandalous because the police of Lagos is distributed, or rather concentrated, on the same principle and in the same locality as the light. By this ingenious process on the part of the authorities the greater portion of the town is made over to darkness and depredators, and has become most notoriously unsafe both for persons and property. Burglary, robbery, and violence are said to be of nightly occurrence. There seems to be a rather large criminal element among the Lagos population; and most certainly, with a local revenue of some £50,000 a year, this ought to be kept adequately in check by street lights and a sufficiently numerous, good, and well-distributed police. That it is not so is a disgrace to the Executive authorities, a reproach to British rule, and leads us moreover to ask the question whether the time has not arrived at which some independent native element should be admitted to the Executive and Legislative Council. There are many local quicksands which a European Executive cannot discover; many local wants with which a European Executive will not sufficiently, if at all, sympathize. The addition of a thoroughly independent elected native element in the Council would bring in that knowledge and sympathy, and would be tending in the direction indicated by the House of Commons Committee of 1864-5, preparing the natives for self-government, under, of course, the sovereign control of Great Britain. Education, by the action of Missionary High Schools in West Africa, and the constantly deepening stream of youth sent by their parents to England for medical, legal, and general instruction, is really making considerable progress among a section of the population of the Settlements, as indicated by the gradual formation of local Bars, constituted by members of the Temple and Lincoln’s Inn; by the increasing number of medical practitioners who are members of the London and Edinburgh College of Surgeons and Physicians; and not least in importance by the number of young men who have been sent to England to be educated in the higher branches of learning, and who are now returning to their native land to take their part in the work of civilization and progress. It is to these men that we must look for the future development of the West African Settlements, and it is to them that the British Government must look for the future maintenance of its influence and authority in those regions. The time has come when the British Government must recognize the fact that the West African Settlements are no longer mere outposts of Empire, but are becoming integral parts of the British dominions, with a population that is rapidly advancing in intelligence and civilization, and that is entitled to a voice in the management of its own affairs. The sooner this is recognized, the better it will be for all concerned.\n**91**', 'last_edit_date': '1881-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICANS IN LONDON', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The lot of a Native of West Africa, who may be staying in London for the first time, is not a very enviable one.

We hold that great improvements ought to be effected therein, and that such improvements would conduce alike to the commercial and political advantage of our country and to the prosperity of the natives, whose social progress cannot but yield profit to those who deal with them. We are strongly of opinion, however, that whatever faults now occur in the administration of our West African Crown colonies, those faults are fewer and more remediable than they would be if the Gambia or Sierra Leone or the Gold Coast or Lagos were in the hands of trading corporations. All along those portions of the West African coast which are claimed as British possessions, we would urge, firm control should be maintained by her Majesty's Government, in the interests both of white traders and of the natives with whom they trade. We venture to submit that if this control were limited to the establishment of equitable tariffs and to whatever police regulations were found necessary for the maintenance of order, and if territorial rights were exercised over only such areas as were required for actual occupation by British subjects, the administration of the colonies would be far more economical and far more beneficial than it has hitherto proved to be. The best, if not the only, chance of a prosperous future for British West Africa depends, we consider, on the careful avoidance of all schemes of conquest in the interior and of despotic interference with native institutions, and on the maintenance of a generously conceived and wisely directed protectorate over the natives, they being encouraged to enter into treaty arrangements with us, by which it would be no less to their advantage than to ours for them to abide. We regard with interest and hope the approach to this course which is being made in Lagos, and we desire that the same course should be pursued much more completely in the Oil Rivers District.\n\nWe should go beyond our present purpose, and should overtax your Lordship's courtesy, were we on this occasion to set forth in detail our views as to the general policy which, in our opinion, should be adopted and enforced throughout the several parts of British West Africa. But we beg most respectfully, yet at the same time most earnestly, to state to your Lordship our conviction that the present disorganised and discreditable state of affairs in the Oil Rivers District calls for prompt and thorough amendment, and that this amendment should be aimed at by placing the district under the direct control of the Crown, instead of its being handed over to a chartered company.\n\nWe have the honour to be,  \nMy Lord Marquis,  \nYour Lordship's most obedient servants,  \n*(Here follow the Signatures.)*\n\n---"", 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'How to Conciliate Natives, Etc., in a New Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## HOW TO CONCILIATE NATIVES, ETC., IN A NEW COLONY.\n\nThe following is an abridged account of _an affair_ that came off lately at Lagos. Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued. Few days after, hearing at the police-station. Decision—""The Europeans to pay for the summons, 3s.""\n\nOur correspondent says: ""This is a British colony. Is that English justice? Is that the way the white people mean continually to treat us, to make us respect, fear, and honour them?"" He adds: ""If a black man had committed a similar offence, he would most likely have got one or two years\' imprisonment."" And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_. We believe so too. For this reason, among others, we insert his complaint. We cannot afford to have the game of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast played over again at Lagos. We know the chief authority will see this in our columns; and we hope to hear that, if justice has not been duly administered, the error will be rectified. We abstain from further remark at present, except to express our regret that the chief authorities, in so small a place as Lagos, should seem to be so inaccessible to those who fancy they have been wronged by subordinate officials.', 'last_edit_date': '1863-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE WEST AFRICAN DELIMITATION QUESTION', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Coke (the chairman), reminded Mr. Hughes that the constitution of this country was not the same as that of foreign countries, and the way other nations managed their affairs was different from the manner adopted by England. A French merchant went to Siam, or anywhere else, settled down, undertook enterprises, and established himself to a certain point, when he called in the assistance of his Government, who invested him with authority, and authorised him to establish commercial relations with the people in the name of the Government. That man had his own private interest, backed up by Government authority, and he went on pushing his contracts in the name of the Government till he went too far, and, perhaps, trod upon the toes of the English traders. Then representations were made by our traders, communications passed between the foreign Government and our own Foreign Office, and the matter was settled by the foreign Government simply saying that the man had exceeded his instructions. It was necessary, in order to stop that class of agents from going beyond their instructions, to set the English Government to work. The Government of England represented the people, and unless the people formed on opinion, and represented it to the Government, it did not seem to be the duty of the authorities to act. This was a matter in which the large interests of the African section of the chamber were particularly concerned, and they were the people of this country in this particular case. They wished to speak with one mouth through the chamber to the Foreign Office, so that they might request the Government to put a stop to those malpractices. A similar case arose some two or three years ago in the neighbourhood of Lagos, where the French were doing the same thing as they were now doing at Sierra Leone. They tried to get behind the Colony of Lagos, and made a treaty with the King of Abeokuta in order to cut off the stream of trade that came down from the interior to Lagos, and to turn it down to the French territories so that it might be exported from French ports. The chamber sent a deputation to Lord Knutsford, and his lordship had to go to the Foreign Office in order to communicate with the French Government. The result of the negotiations was that the treaty was abandoned, the French Government stating that it was a mistake, the efforts of the French local authorities were rendered futile, and the English were now carrying out their trade very satisfactorily. They addressed the Foreign Office this time on the advice of Lord Knutsford, who had stated at the last deputation that it was necessary to communicate with the French Government through the Foreign Office. He would, however, communicate with the Colonial Office and ask them to send a representative with the deputation to support their claims. It would be very desirable that they should get Baron De Worms, who was connected with the Colonial Office, to perform the ceremony of introducing the deputation, and it was satisfactory to see Mr. Hughes present on that occasion, since he could communicate with Baron De Worms on the subject.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'High Officials in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all familiar with the adage that ""Example is better than precept;"" which is only a brief and imperfect mode of saying that precept comes more forcibly home to the hearer when it is illustrated and enforced by the conduct of the teacher; and that precept cannot be expected to have much weight and influence when what it enjoins is in direct opposition to the acts and conduct of the utterer. The evil practices of the mere verbal moralist do not annul the holy precepts that may fall from his lips; but they do impair, if not destroy, their efficacy even among those who may have had the inestimable advantages of religious and moral training. And if this be the case where there ought to be sufficient mental enlightenment to enable the hearer and beholder to separate between the precept and the man whose office or position makes it a part of his duty to promulgate it, even when daily transgressing its commands, how much more injuriously must it obtain among the poor ignorant, uneducated, and unenlightened people of Africa, who, if they reason at all, can only reason from the facts that are brought under their notice. One of the first things that forced itself upon us when we commenced our public labours for Africa, was the mightily pernicious influence on the African mind and conduct of the evil examples set by Europeans exercising authority on the West Coast. We shall not recapitulate charges which from time to time it has been our painful duty to make against officials, and which have been always most reluctantly made by us. Thank God there has been a gradual improvement in these matters; but there is yet much to condemn. Our officials do not yet seem to have quite got rid of the old feeling among their class, that in taking service in Africa they were freed at once from all those religious and moral restraints to which they were more or less subject in Great Britain and Ireland; and that they may do with impunity all such things as may be done by irresponsible traders frequenting the Coast in the legitimate search for gain, and who are only answerable to their own consciences as before God. British officials represent the British nation and its Sovereign, and ought to represent also the precepts of the Christian religion which these profess. The declared policy which they have to carry out or help to forward, is one of the Christian enlightenment of the natives, and their preparation for the responsible duties of self-government as members of dependent or independent African communities; and whatever may have been previously the case, they are now amenable to public opinion in England and Africa as represented by the African Times.

England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

This complexity adds depth to the claim, showing that while treaties were a tool for expansion, they were not universally accepted or effective without challenges.",True,1615,Colonial Administration,General Critique of Colonial Administrations,"[{'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Treaty-making 1885-1902', 'content': 'Prior to the Berlin Act, European powers had acquired spheres of influence in Africa in a variety of ways - through settlement, exploration, the establishment of commercial posts, missionary settlements, the occupation of strategic areas, and by making treaties with African rulers.$^{41}$ Following the conference, influence by means of treaty became the most important method of effecting the paper partition of the continent. These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Treaty-making 1885-1902 > The bilateral European partition treaties', 'content': ""The acquisition of a sphere of influence by treaty was usually the first stage in the occupation of an African state by a European power. If such a treaty was not contested by any other European power, the incumbent power gradually turned its treaty rights into sovereign rights. A sphere of influence arose, therefore, in the first instance, by a unilateral declaration; it became a reality only when it was accepted or not contested by other European powers. Often spheres of influences were contested, but these territorial difficulties and boundary disputes were eventually settled and ratified as a result of mutual agreements between two or more imperialist powers operating in the same region. The limits of these territorial settle› ments were determined, as closely as possible, by a natural boundary, or, where no such boundary existed, by longitude and latitude. Occasionally they took account of indigenous political boundaries.\nThe Anglo-German Treaty of 29 April (and 7 May) 1885 which defined the 'spheres of action' of the two countries in certain parts of Africa is regarded as perhaps the first serious application of the spheres of influence theory in modern times.$^{48}$ By a series of similar treaties, agreements and conventions, the paper partition of Africa was virtually concluded by the end of the century.

But because a sphere of influence was a political rather than a legal notion, a friendly power might choose to respect this fact while an unfriendly power might choose to ignore it. The same was true of the hinterland doctrine, notorious for its evocation of the principle of 'manifest destiny' and the wild claims made on its behalf.

The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials.

The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850.

Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like.

Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa.

Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

This was the more so because the success of the African leaders had been achieved at the cost of what may be called the legacy of wars.\nThere had emerged larger, stronger states with a tendency towards the concentration of executive power in individuals and specific title holders directly responsible to the ruler, and officials gaining office more by merit, achievement and favour of the ruler than by hereditary rights. In the process of achieving such stronger states with a more effective concentration of executive power, weaker states had disappeared. Various groups in danger of losing power and various vested interests adversely affected had fought back and wars had become endemic.

The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease. Indeed, for Europe, the timing of the conquest could not have been better; for Africa it could not have been worse."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared. And yet even more noticeable were the many new centres of power that emerged, experimenting with new administrative structures, generally tending towards a more effective exercise of power by the ruler, clearer definition of his jurisdiction, greater control of officials who owed their positions to his favour rather than their own hereditary rights, improved tax systems and the like. 5\nSome historians have described these reformist movements as the activi› ties of African 'proto-nationalists and empire builders' engaged in a kind of African Scramble which in part provoked, or at least helps to explain, the European Scramble.$^{6}$ In fact, these reformist activities were not a sudden or fitful movement in any way comparable with the European Scramble. The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century.

But if there are difficulties ahead, it is well that the country should be prepared for them in good time. From the detailed accounts we have lately received of the defeat of Usibepu, the loyal Zulu chief, whose power had been established on the ruins of Cetewayo\'s, it appears that the position of the Reserve and of the British Resident is seriously threatened. The conquerors of Usibepu included not only the Usutus, the tribesmen who had been unshaken in their allegiance to Cetewayo, but a powerful body of Boers from the Transvaal. To the latter, it is said, was due the success of the attack on Usibepu\'s warriors, who, having repulsed the onslaught of their native enemies, were broken by the withering fire of the Dutch riflemen. The flight of Usibepu leaves the ground clear for the ambition of the Boer leaders, and brings the Usutus, intoxicated by victory, face to face with the British forces within the Reserve. It is evident that the former adherents of Cetewayo are, for the moment, merely tools of the adventurers from the Transvaal, who imagine that there is something to be gained by stirring up turmoil among the Zulus. The experiment is, perhaps, not as hopeful as its authors believe, for the Zulus, as South African history shows, are not tools that can always be handled with safety and success by the Boers. In order, however, to rid themselves of Usibepu, and to give a check to the British power, the Usutus are willing to become the close allies of the Transvaal Republic, or, at all events, of its more reckless and aggressive spirits. Dinizulu, the youthful son of Cetewayo, has been set up as a puppet sovereign by the Boers, who have promised him their protection and assistance, and to revive a forgotten treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with Cetewayo\'s father, Panda. The first-fruits of this confederacy are visible in the overthrow of Usibepu. The latter reckoned, apparently, upon English support, though without any well-defined claim, and the Boers will in all probability make use of his ""abandonment"" as a cogent argument addressed to the native mind in favour of the Dutch instead of the British connexion. The Boers, at the same time, if not possessed of much political knowledge, can hardly be ignorant of the serious aspects of an attack upon England, and having enough to occupy them immediately in the absorption of the territories of Usibepu and his adherents, they will hardly encourage their new allies to press their advantage so far as to threaten the Reserve. But the Usutus are savages, and, while ready enough to accept the assistance of the Boers in battle, they may not be equally willing to pay deference to the prudent counsels of their advisers. They have already declared, in menacing language, that they will not spare either the Reserve or Natal itself in their campaign of vengeance. Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, had been forced to retreat even before the recent victory of the Boers and Usutus over Usibepu, and has been standing for some time on the defensive. The Imperial forces in Natal and in the Reserve are, no doubt, strong enough to repel any partial and unorganized raid, but there is now, it is clear, a possibility, at least, of more serious perils, which is causing disquietude at Maritzburg and Durban.'}, {'id': 4905, 'article_title': 'GERMANY AND THE WEST COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'GERMANY AND THE WEST COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1884#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_09_1884', 'content': ""We learn that one of the English mail steamers just arrived at Liverpool was detained at Quitta for several hours, awaiting official documents from the authorities there, in order that she might convey the same to Governor Young at Accra.

They blamed the furious river for having so long barred all intercourse between them and the white people whom they had heard of. I entered into treaties with them according to their form—viz., exchanging our blood, which is a most binding ceremony, and called blood-brotherhood. I promised them I should return. The five months we laboured through the cataracts gave me many opportunities to study the people and their needs, and vague plans for fulfilment of my promise to them were made. After returning to Europe I heard of several schemes being in progress for the extension of commerce in Africa, and much correspondence passed between promoters and myself relative to the ways and means. One, however, attracted me most: it was the Internationale Association Africaine. After assisting in its counsels, I was commissioned to take an expedition into Africa to carry out my promise to the tribes around Stanley Pool. We were limited at first to a small sum of money, more as a test than for any serious work; but the success of the mission was so marked that the Association was emboldened to proceed on a larger scale. Stanley Pool was gained, and we were in peaceful occupation of a good port, with friendly neighbours. It was about this time that we became an object of attack—furtive advance was made from the north, the Portuguese assailed us from the south, and ill-natured and suspicious traders in our rear. In our front were the welcoming native tribes. Events which long ago became public made us aware that the European nations were resolved upon securing to their own particular advantage the fruits of our enterprise, and that if we were not quick to secure for ourselves and clients a free road we might look upon our enterprise as useless and void. Accordingly, we sounded the feelings of the natives; we laid the question before them as frankly as I now lay it before you. We made treaties with them, by which they ceded to us the sovereignty and every right which could be taken by others to our disadvantage. We despatched agents along both banks of the river from Stanley Pool down to Nokki, and secured the governorship, the right to say who should come into the land; the right to barter, to trade, to cultivate, to mine, and so forth, for the Association and its clients.'}, {'id': 4970, 'article_title': 'A Journey through the Senegal District', 'full_section_title': 'A Journey through the Senegal District', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_12_1884', 'content': ""Dr. Colin, a doctor in the French Army, has lately returned from an expedition to the Western Soudan, having explored a portion of the valley of the Falemé, one of the principal affluents of the Senegal, and the auriferous region between that river and the Bafing. He started from Podor on June 24, 1883, with a convoy of twelve negroes and twelve beasts of burden, following the left bank of the Senegal as far as Bakel and crossing the Fouta, where the natives of the Toucouleurs tribe gave them a great deal of trouble. His only white companion injured himself at this point, and had to go back to St. Louis. From Bakel Dr. Colin made his way to Senudebu, at one time a French fort, but now unoccupied. As the Toucouleurs men who accompanied him refused to enter the Malinké territory, he left his beasts of burden and material there and made his way to the French station at Medina, where he found a fresh convoy. At Dialafara, the capital of the Tambaoura, he was very cordially received by the chief of that country, who signed a treaty placing himself under the protectorate of France, with the exclusive right to make roads and work the gold mines, which Dr. Colin described as being very valuable. The natives here are, he says, very much inclined to open commercial relations with France, so as to be able to send their products to the factories of the Senegal. The Malinkés, to whom Dialafara belongs, are described by him as believing in a superior Power, but as not practising any outward rite. The negro type predominates among them, but there are also many who have intermarried with Arabs. From Dialafara, Dr. Colin proceeded to Kassama, the capital of the Diebedugu, situated a day's march from Kundian, one of the strongest cities in the States of the King of Segu. Dr. Colin was the first European to visit this place, and he was so well received by the king that he remained there a month, studying the resources of the country, which, he says, abounds with cattle, indigo, cotton, and gutta-percha. The two thousand Malinkés of Kassama live in peace with the Toucouleurs of Kundian, though, as a rule, the two tribes are very hostile to one another. The gold mines are about six miles to the south of Kassama, at the foot of the mountain chain which divides the valleys of the Falemé and the Bafing. The gold is exchanged for salt, of which there is none in the country, and 12s. worth of gold can be had for a quantity of salt worth only 1s. at St. Louis. From Kassama Dr. Colin explored the course of the river Falemé, and his description of this stream and of the valley through which it runs shows that it must have great attractions for the hunters of big game, such as elephants, lions, panthers, wild cattle, and antelopes, which are very abundant there. Returning to Bakel for fresh provisions, he found it impossible again to ascend the Falemé as he had intended, owing to the rainy season setting in, so he made his way down to St. Louis, taking with him the son of the King of Kassama, who came to offer allegiance to France on behalf of his father. He also had as his companion from Bakel to St. Louis, a Moor from Timbuctoo, who had been deputed by the corporation of merchants there to ask the Governor of St. Louis to open a trade route to their city by the Niger. This Moor stated that if such a route were to be opened, all the trade of Timbuctoo would pass that way instead of through Morocco; and he added that the upper waters of the Niger are navigable from Timbuctoo to Bamaku.""}, {'id': 4999, 'article_title': 'The German Settlement on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The German Settlement on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1885#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_01_1885', 'content': 'With reference to some details respecting an extension of British protection over the Cameroon Mountains and the coastline to Calabar, recently given by the Vienna correspondent of the *Daily Chronicle*, the same correspondent now adds: ""That there is truth in the report is shown by a later account of M.

But in the meantime a German gunboat, with Dr. Nachtigal and Dr. Buchner on board, had arrived at Cameroons, and, aided by the German factory there, had succeeded in inducing the chieftains to sign an agreement placing the Cameroon River and the Bimbia territory under German protection. The chiefs, however, having given their signatures without consulting the natives, the latter are very indignant, and have protested against the arrangement. Victoria has been acquired by the British, who purchased the territory from the Catholic missionaries. Rogozinski, fearing that the Germans were coveting Bobia—a territory acquired for the Catholic mission—and other districts, wrote to the British Consul, advising him to at once have the coast-line, from Victoria to Calabar, placed under British protection. The reply to this was the arrival, at the end of August, of the British gunboat *Forward*. The assumption of the protectorate was then performed without difficulty and delay. The meaning of the protectorate was explained to the natives by interpreters. The chieftains and the elders signed the agreement by putting crosses under their signatures, and the commander of the gunboat made them presents. On returning they passed two German gunboats sailing to Bibundi. Fortunately, they came too late. The British Consul has separated Bobia and the Mandoleh Island from Victoria, placing both under a separate jurisdiction.

He is a very frank, straightforward, simple-spoken man, who tells his tale to the point, and it is difficult to hear what he has to say without recognizing the transparent simplicity of the traveller, or without sympathizing with what he has to say.

Herr Einwald is not a land jobber, nor does he for a moment contemplate making any profit out of the territory ceded to him by Dinizulu. His first step was to make it over in writing to Herr Lüderitz, of Angra Pequeña, by whom it is being pressed upon the German Government. Herr Einwald will no doubt see Lord Derby, and explain to him exactly the position of affairs in Zululand, the nature of his grant from Dinizulu, the reason why it was obtained, and he will ask in return to learn from Lord Derby what England intends to do in the unfortunate country which has been abandoned to anarchy. Herr Einwald is an old traveller in these parts, nor is this the first occasion on which he has addressed himself to the English Colonial Office. Again and again he has sent to the English authorities warning words as to what would follow if they persisted in a policy which he considered as mischievous as it was mistaken.

On arriving at Dakar, a town of Senegal, where we laid our shore end, three others and myself were landed to take charge of the end of the cable during the operations and keep up communication with the ship. For three days we had to keep continual watch in the hut which was built on the beach to contain the instruments. Behind was a peculiarly unsavoury native town; in front of us was the slaughter-house for the whole place. The cattle were the small mouse-coloured cattle, with splendid horns and humps on their backs, to which one is accustomed in illustrated books on Africa, and the poor brutes used to suffer dreadfully. Long before the cattle came in sight the sharks began to gather round the beach, over which the blood was to run, and the trees were tenanted by flocks of vultures and carrion crows. The rapidity with which these animals cleared the slaughter-house of everything but the blood-stains as soon as the butchers had left with the meat was perfectly astonishing. Dakar itself was very unwholesome, and a house was taken for us to occupy when we were not engaged in the hut on the island of Gorée, lying on in the Bay of Dakar. It is merely a rock, and at one time was in the possession of the English, who, on leaving it to the French, did so on condition that it should be a free port. Here we occupied the upper rooms of a house which was totally unfurnished, but was occupied by a regular army of negresses, whose manners and customs amused us very much. Two of these negresses were supposed to be our servants for one franc a day. They could do little for us except prepare our meals, and those by no means up to the taste of the European. We had no beds, only mattresses and rugs, and camp-chairs and wine cases to sit on.

A striking example is that of the Congo Free State, which, in addition to the magnificent endowment of King Leopold, is subsidised to the extent of £80,000 a year by the Belgian Government. Great Britain, on the other hand, has never contributed a shilling to aid us in our work of exploration, civilisation and extirpation of the slave trade. It would be idle to complain, even if we were disposed to do so, of being thus left entirely to our own resources, and it may be that in the long run we shall profit more from the energy evoked and the liberty fostered by independence of State subsidies and State interference. But it is an indisputable fact that commerce on the Niger has suffered heavily during the last three years from the pecuniary encouragement given to our foreign neighbours. No appreciable effect is indeed produced in respect of those articles of African produce such as gum, kernels, oil and rubber, which are not suited for land carriage over long distances; but in respect of one valuable product—viz., ivory, which is carried on the backs of slaves for immense distances at a small cost, these subsidies, which practically amount to bonuses to the local merchants, have unquestionably diverted a considerable value from the Niger markets to those of more favoured regions, and have thus diminished your annual dividends to the extent of at least 4 per cent. It is not easy to see how this result has benefited the taxpayers of the European States which pay these bonuses out of their home exchequers; but it has undoubtedly enriched the merchants of various nationalities trading in their African possessions at the expense of commerce in unsubsidised British possessions where the whole cost of administration and development has to be met by taxation on trade. Passing from these considerations of our external relations to our neighbours, I will say a few words on our own internal condition, that is on the progress of settlement within our present sphere of operations. You may perhaps remember that at our meeting two years ago I dwelt at considerable length on the great difficulties with which we have had to contend, apart from those arising from the unhealthiness of the climate and from the intermittent residence and consequent want of continuity in our staff in Africa. I pointed out that ""we have to deal with 800 tribes who have been for countless generations plunged in idle barbarism, whose sole idea of wealth has been the holding of slaves, and whose main occupation in life has been to acquire such slaves by intertribal war or kidnapping."" I am glad to be able to tell you that year by year there has been a steady growth of the whole, some influence and power of the Company—a growth necessarily slow and incomplete, but more rapid than we had ventured to anticipate. The missionaries in the Lower Niger have borne witness to the remarkable progress of peace and security under our rule. You must not understand me as saying that there is not still in those regions a vast amount of gross barbarism and uncurbed ferocity; but only that these have been mitigated and even in some places abated to a degree which more than justifies our presence there as the ruling power. Having achieved such striking success as far up the Niger as Lokoja, we have thought the time ripe for taking similar measures in the Pagan countries to the south of the Lower Benue; where, during the few years since we first established our stations, and probably for many years previously, incalculable miseries have been inflicted on the natives by slave hunters from the North and East. It is an inevitable consequence of these raids that their operations expand year by year in a wider circle, as belt after belt of country is devastated and depopulated, leaving no further prey for the slave hunters; so that tribes whom we had already commenced to train to peaceful commerce and whom we were teaching to utilise the natural resources of that fertile region, have disappeared, most of their members having been either killed or captured as slaves, while the more fortunate are hiding amongst the forests and rocks in hopes of escaping the fate of their companions. The region of which I am speaking is at present one of the principal hunting grounds for supplying the enormous and apparently insatiable demand for slaves in the Central Soudan and even as far as Morocco. You will at once understand that if we longer delayed taking the necessary remedial measures all hope of developing those fertile and once populous regions must be abandoned. We are therefore impelled by interest, as well as the ordinary feelings of humanity, to act decisively at this, the earliest practicable moment, and to afford these pagan populations— with whom we have made treaties—efficient protection to life, freedom, and property. We have, therefore, ordered the military occupation of this region, which is now being executed. This measure has demanded an increase to our small army and consequently additional expenditure, which must temporarily be met by increased taxation. I must remind you that although the establishment of peace and security will certainly bear fruit in largely increased commerce yielding a larger revenue, the immediate result will be only to preserve the trade already existing. The development which will naturally arise from a sense of security amongst the natives cannot be expected at once. You must remember that the greater portion of the taxation at present falls upon the Company, which is still by far the largest European trader in the territories, although no longer alone there, as at the time of the issue of the Charter. This has confirmed us in the belief that it will be wiser for us not to declare for 1890 more than our usual 6 per cent. dividend. I now move that the Report and Accounts be received and adopted.

On the east, the south, and the west, we see her ever watchful and ready to found a colony, or even a trading station only, and to enter into treaties with the native kings and chiefs; the outcome of all which is sure to be, sooner or later, the subordination of the native to the European influence. In the course of one week recently, there were laid before the Reichstag no less than three treaties under which chiefs of various tribes on the West Coast place themselves and their people under the protection of the German Empire. The meaning of these treaties is, says Kühlow\'s Trade Review (to which we are indebted for much information as to the German movement all over Africa), sooner or later ""annexation,"" as by them the influence of all other foreign Powers is expressly excluded, while the chiefs place themselves—so far, at least, as all exterior matters are concerned—entirely in the hands of Germany. Under these treaties the natives concerned are assured of protection from foreign foes; but, on the other hand, they undertake not to entertain any warlike intention independently of the Great Power. It is not reasonable to suppose that the natives fully understand the importance of the agreements into which they appear so readily to have entered; but this much at least is clear, that Germany, as she agrees to be responsible for the security of these people in time of trouble, must be prepared to restrain them from anything that would tend to the provocation of surrounding tribes, or from any overt act that would lead to hostilities. We may rest assured that Germany will take good care that the power she has thus obtained will be exercised whenever it suits her policy and the principles of German extension, which have been before her eyes ever since the first conception of a German colonial policy.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1886#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

The thoughts of those who are interested in the welfare, present and future, of Africa—and that is tantamount to saying the whole civilized world—have been directed to that hall in the Palace of the German Chancellor in which the delegates of the European Powers have met to discuss the question, ""What shall we do with it?"" The Treaty of Berlin was in the mouth of every one six years ago: then, in this same hall, and under the presidency of ""the man of blood and iron"" who is the moving spirit at the present gathering, the delegates of Europe met to discuss the best means to be used to bolster up the effete government of Turkey—and ended by taking so much territory away, on the understanding that having less to govern, greater attention could be given to what was still left to the Sublime Porte. But it was well understood that the catastrophe was only deferred; that the final overthrow of the Turkish rule in Europe is inevitable. The present gathering is in every way different to that which preceded it—the object they have in view is to shape the destiny of a continent. We read that on the wall before the Plenipotentiaries hung an immense map of Africa, as if to remind them that their business was not to do with any particular nation, but with a quarter of the world—not with a kingdom that had been great in past days, and, through misgovernment and oppression, had sunk to the level of a tenth-rate Power, but with whole nations concerning whom the page of history is a blank. The future of Africa is in the hands of Europe, and to the Berlin Conference is committed the solution of the question—who is to hold Africa, and on what principles should it be held. The Conference may be said to have arisen in the first instance out of the Congo Treaty of Feb., 1884, between Portugal and Great Britain, which was, in no small measure, due to the discoveries commenced by Commander Cameron and completed by Mr. Stanley, of the immense importance as a trade route of the River Congo, flowing as it does through the heart of Africa, and issuing into the Atlantic Ocean. So long as the trading was confined to a few miles from its mouth, matters were allowed to take their chance. Portugal claimed the sovereignty of the adjacent region, but did nothing to enforce or justify her claim, which was regarded with indifference by most of the Powers, and always disallowed by Great Britain. But when the International African Association came to the front, setting up stations along the river, and thus opening up the interior, when also M. de Brazza claimed a portion of the upper waters for his country, and it was known that France had bargained for what we may call the reversionary interests of the International Association, it became necessary to take some steps to secure order and freedom of trading at the mouths and along the course of what was evidently destined shortly to become one of the leading highways of the world\'s commerce. Lord Granville saw no better way than by recognizing the sovereign rights of Portugal over the strip of coast at the mouth of the Congo, making this acceptance conditional upon the latter\'s agreeing to maintain freedom of trade and navigation, and binding her to secure the execution of this promise under the superintendence of an International Commission similar to that which discharges a like office on the lower waters of the Danube. On these terms, and with the addition of the invariable article requiring co-operation in the extinction of the slave trade, a Treaty was drawn up and signed by the Plenipotentiaries on February 26th last. But before the ratification could take place a storm of indignation was aroused on all sides, the merchants of the two nations principally concerned being loudest in their expressions of disapproval, with the result that the Treaty was never ratified, but allowed to drop out of existence. So that there still remained for disposal the question of the Congo—who should possess it, and how far could the principles of free trade and navigation be maintained? To complicate matters still further, came the action of the Germans, who were suddenly possessed with a mania for colonization, and proceeded to annex various districts along the West Coast, as it is alleged, without paying due regard to the previously acquired rights of others. In abandoning the Congo Treaty, Lord Granville had let fall the suggestion that Portugal and Great Britain might unite in proposing to the other Powers some international arrangement which would prove more acceptable. Prince Bismarck took the hint, and thereupon issued invitations to the Powers to send representatives to Berlin to discuss the measures to be taken, and the result is the assembling of this Conference, which must ever exercise a wide influence upon the future of Africa. It would be premature at present to discuss the proceedings of the Conference and the special Committee of Experts, but one thing would seem to be assured—viz., we shall obtain the material and practical results desired, in fuller measure and with surer guarantees than could be looked for under the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Niger and Territories on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have been requested to publish the following correspondence:—\n\n""Chamber of Commerce, Manchester, Nov. 2, 1883.\n\n""My Lord,—In November last year this Chamber addressed to your lordship a memorial praying that the earnest endeavours of Her Majesty\'s Government might be directed towards promoting a friendly understanding with other European Governments in order that the sovereign and territorial rights of the natives of the Congo River, and of the adjacent territories on the West Coast of Africa, might be respected and maintained, and that there should be no interference on the part of any Power with the existing freedom of navigation and commerce.\n\n""The attention of other European nations is now being devoted to the extension of commerce, and to the increasing importance, not only of the Congo, but also of the Niger and other rivers, which are the principal means of communication and of trade with the populous tribes in the centre of Africa, and there is reason to fear that they are seeking to annex territories, and also to secure such concessions from native rulers as may enable them to put a hindrance to that freedom of trade and navigation which has hitherto been enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa.\n\n""Your lordship has recently been informed of certain proceedings of French officers on the Niger and the Bonny, and other rivers and places on the African coast, which call for the serious consideration of Her Majesty\'s Government.

This question presents two aspects—first, the rights of the grantor; secondly, the rights of the grantee. First, they say, with regard to the law of nations, we must ask ourselves whether the chiefs of savage tribes can make treaties, &c., or whether the tribes they represent are considered as States capable of making international treaties. The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence. Therefore, only territories without masters, that is, those in which no sovereign power is as yet established, can be rightfully available for occupation.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.724, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.752, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them.

What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910.

A comparable arrangement existed in the Spanish-dominated portion of Morocco where the cadi was guided in his role by the Inventare, the Spanish counterpart of the contrôleur civil.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage. The present system is a great injustice to Sierra Leone, and it is high time that it should be remedied.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The West African settlements comprise Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos. Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all more or less acquainted with the phrase, ""grandmotherly government,"" and know how much annoyance is caused—and that, too, with but little corresponding advantage—when the Legislature takes upon itself to decide upon minor questions of purely social interest, the solution of which is best left to the individual; but the complaint of the inhabitants of the West African Settlements is not that now and then the Legislature meddles with matters best left to individual judgment, but that the people are altogether suffering from ""over-government."" In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.751, 'probability_score': 0.07, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It may also be added that the absence of any certain and speedy communication between the settlements in those days had, doubtless, some share in leading the Committee of 1842 to recommend the separation of all the governments.\n\nThe arrangement now contemplated will make it necessary to provide the colonies with greater facilities for intercommunication than they at present possess; and in making the necessary provision for this purpose, it will be right to consider whether it will not be also possible so to arrange that the settlements having an extensive sea-board or much internal water communication may be assisted in maintaining that regular and certain intercourse with their people, which is one of the surest guarantees for the preservation of peace.\n\nSierra Leone, as the headquarters of the general Government, will require the exclusive services of a small steamer suitable for visiting the settlements.

In former times sufficient attention was not always given by the authorities to the suitability of candidates for employment in the minor posts in these then much despised West African possessions. But all this has greatly changed. The growing importance of the West African trade, and the general éclaircissement which followed the operations of the Ashanti War, have brought about a different spirit in the administration of these colonies, and the present colonial service in West Africa is not inferior to any other branch of the service in other parts of the world, and of late has furnished a considerable proportion of remarkable men who have distinguished themselves on the West Coast of Africa, and have been raised to posts of great influence and distinction elsewhere. I think, however, that decidedly more might be done to encourage such work as I have referred to in Lagos, namely, a thorough and scientific examination of the natural history and ethnology of these lands, so that we can be better guided in our administration of them, both by increasing our knowledge of their natural resources and by becoming more acquainted with the character of the races whom we are to rule. Especially should the learning of native languages be fostered among colonial officers. This movement has been already begun on the Gold Coast by Sir Brandford Griffith, and in Lagos by Captain Moloney, but I do not think any official steps have been taken in the matter. In nearly all the great divisions of Africa there is some lingua Franca—some widespread language of general use among native traders, or the ruling caste, which would be understood everywhere, from Benin to Old Calabar, and up the Niger to its confluence with the Benue; the Yoruba tongue, which is prevalent throughout Logos colony and right away to the kingdom of Nupe; the Hausa language, which is a good deal spoken in the Gold Coast colony, and which is one of the leading tongues of the Niger basin; the Mandingo, which is widely spread as a commercial language over the Sierra Leone colony; and the Wolof, which is much spoken on the Gambia. In the learning of each one of these languages in their respective spheres of influence colonial officers should be encouraged by small bounties or some palpable reward. These languages are simple in construction, and are illustrated by grammars and dictionaries published by the various missionary societies.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Officials and Pestilential Filth', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A glance at our 112th page will convince the most incredulous that it is not only in the matter of gaol discipline and management that the extremely efficient and well-selected officials appointed by the Colonial-office to the West Coast of Africa show an entire absence of that ""ordinary intelligence"" which Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen so desiderates for a proper comprehension of West African affairs. Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

We fully agreed in the necessity of a totally independent executive administration for what is now the Gold Coast Colony, which could not be effectively governed from Sierra Leone, if there was to be any departure from the old do-nothing-good policy at Cape Coast. If we are to give credit to what has been now all but officially stated, the present administrative vacancy at Sierra Leone is to be filled up by the appointment to that place of the actual Administrator at the Gambia, Mr. Kortright; who is there to have the title of Governor of the West African Settlements; the Gambia being executively united with Sierra Leone and the Sherbro\' under him. But why should these dependencies be united administratively—and executively, as we hope they will be—under such an exceedingly vague and indefinite title? Why should the name of Sierra Leone, which has been fostered into something akin to metropolitan importance, be thus contemptuously set aside; and Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and Sherbro\', figure only in future as a group of West African Settlements? Is it that Her Majesty\'s Government, sensible too late of the irrevocable and irremediable faults in the past, whereby the commercial future of Sierra Leone has been so compromised and restricted, look upon Sierra Leone as doomed to comparative stagnation and insignificance, while the Gold Coast shall be developing in wealth, power, and dominion? It may be so. There is very much of this aspect about the adoption of such a title, as designating a group of unimportant places which the British Government may find it, in the course of a few years, advisable to retire from, to drop, or to dispose of. We strove heartily, some few years since, to rouse the Sierra Leone people to a sense of their actual and prospective position, and to the true and lasting interests of their country. But Sierra Leone has been too much wrapped up in self-conceit. She thought it enough to puff her cigar and twirl her cane in public promenades, and to await with self-sufficient complacency what, according to ancient heathen parlance, the gods might provide. We have strenuously advocated her right to a metropolitan position as regards the administration of justice on the West Coast; but what voice has been heard in or from her in support of the pretensions we have put forward in her behalf? Alas! alas! enervated by Government expenditure, and the concentration of European educational energies within her, she has become politically and industrially decrepit in her very youth; and we feel bound to confess that we are full of apprehensions with regard to her future.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REPRESENTATIVE FOR AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'London, November, 1867.\n\nSir,—To induce a more substantial interest in the government of Western Africa by the Colonial-office; to bring more effectually and unhesitatingly their wants and requirements, as well as their grievances, before the notice of the proper authorities; to effect a thorough and proper government of the poor inhabitants of that unfortunate Coast, and to establish a feeling of interest for them and relating to their affairs in the mind of some of the higher classes of our population, requires a responsible person to be nominated and paid for by the inhabitants of the Coast as their official agent in this country.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""Because of their exclusion, the new elites went into open opposition against the colonial powers. In this open opposition the traditional rulers could not join them. Their continued survival depended on the colonial power and this tied their hands. Also for the most part the traditional rulers were not sufficiently educated to participate meaningfully in the highfaluting debates of the new elites. In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place. Because they did not side with the new elites, the latter regarded them as the lackeys of imperialism. They in turn regarded the new elites as revolutionaries who wanted to destroy im› memorial custom and turn the world upside down.\nTo make matters worse the two were driven by imperialist propaganda into engaging in a struggle over who spoke for the people. The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them. The kind of acrimony which this disagreement at times generated could be seen in the dispute between the chief of Akyem-Abuakwa in the Gold Coast, Nana Sir Ofori Atta and the leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa in the 1920s. It could also be seen in the same period in the quarrel between Harry Thuku's Young Kikuyu Association on the one hand, and the Kikuyu Association dominated by the traditional rulers on the other. 7\nYet one cannot conclude from the foregoing that in the period 1880 to 1935 the normal relationship between the new elites and the traditional rulers was invariably one of conflict. The nature of the relationship varied both in place and time. In the French territories neither the new elites nor the traditional rulers flourished under alien rule. And when after the Second World War the stranglehold of colonial autocracy came to be progressively relaxed, those who emerged as the leaders of French African nationalism included traditional rulers and their descendants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'was the devastation caused in areas surrounding the Zulu nation after 1800 and in the Zulu Wars from 1879 until the last rebellion in 1906.

Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements.

The General lost no time, however, in pageantry. His public speeches were brief and to the point, such as colonists as well as English people had pleasure in hearing and in reading. A strong, fresh, and healthy mind spoke out in plain language. At Barkly West the General and Special Commissioner was practically on the border of Bechuanaland, and while here his duties directly bearing on that territory actually commenced. His first work was to put himself in the way of ascertaining facts. Accordingly, we read that Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Mackenzie, and Mr. Wright were at the Special Commissioner’s head-quarters at Barkly, and were also assisting at the interview with President Kruger at Fourteen Streams. This meeting secured much for the peace of South Africa, and secured it by the ability of the Special Commissioner. Strange to say, the new boundary line had never been marked off—although a year before Lord Derby had asked the High Commissioner to make this an early duty. The ratification of the Convention by the Transvaal took place early in August, and yet Sir Charles Warren found in January that no step had been taken to beacon off the new boundary line. By his orders steps were at once taken to mark off the line in question, and President Kruger took upon himself from the date of the meeting all responsibility for the peace of the district added to the Transvaal by the new line. This was at once practicable, as the boundary line was a well-known trade road. Having failed to gain lands for his Goshen clients, President Kruger yielded to Sir Charles Warren, and consented to make known to the Rooi Grond freebooters the notification printed and issued by Sir Charles to the effect that no one who had engaged in war against Her Majesty’s protectorate could expect anything at his (Sir Charles’s) hands. The affairs of Stellaland did not come formally before the meeting at Fourteen Streams. The Special Commissioner made acquaintance with this tangled web on his reaching Vryburg. It was noted in the newspapers at the time that Mr. Rhodes objected to his predecessor, Mr. Mackenzie, being in Stellaland if he (Mr. Rhodes) was to go there. This remarkable desire on the part of one Deputy Commissioner with reference to his predecessor was acceded to by the Special Commissioner, and the papers announced that Sir Charles entered Stellaland, accompanied by Mr. Rhodes, while Mr. Mackenzie proceeded to visit certain districts in Western Bechuanaland. And now certain very remarkable events took place. Mr. Rhodes had preceded Sir Charles to Vryburg. Not meeting Mr. Van Niekerk there, Mr. Rhodes proceeded to the Transvaal, and induced Mr. Niekerk to accompany him to meet the Special Commissioner. The two political associates came as far as Taung with this object; but found that Sir Charles had passed them on another road on his way to Vryburg. Hastening back again, Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Niekerk were in time to form part of the procession that welcomed the Special Commissioner to Vryburg. I have learned that two days after the arrival of Sir Charles Warren in Cape Town the High Commissioner drew up a paper on the affairs of Stellaland, which he assured Sir Charles it was necessary for him to sign at once in order to secure the peace of that district. So far as this document went it was meant that arrangements of Captain Bower and Mr. Rhodes were to be upheld, and that the Special Commissioner should have nothing to say to the affairs of Stellaland. Once in Stellaland, however, the Special Commissioner was beset with those who brought grave charges against the so-called Government of Stellaland under Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Niekerk. Whether those complaints by themselves would have induced Sir Charles to open up Stellaland affairs is not certain; he must have felt, however, that he had no choice left when Mr. Van Niekerk came forward and demanded full inquiry and examination into his conduct of affairs. Niekerk’s conduct having been what it was in the past, his action in coming over from the Transvaal and demanding this inquiry is inexplicable, unless, indeed, he was over-persuaded by short-sighted friends, who entirely misjudged the character of the Special Commissioner. However the idea of inquiry and examination may have originated, it soon became evident that his request would lead to very serious consequences. The court of officers might try Niekerk for malpractices as to money, land, or other property; but what was the Special Commissioner to do when the charge of murder—aggravated by heinous circumstances—was brought against Mr. Niekerk and others, and was supported by many witnesses? When Mr. Mackenzie asked Niekerk to become Commissioner under him, he was, as we see in the papers, ignorant of the grave charge against him, of complicity in murder; but it is asserted that this was well known to the High Commissioner, to Mr. Rhodes, and to Captain Bower when they virtually constituted Niekerk an Imperial officer after the resignation of Mr. Mackenzie, and that the ex-Deputy Commissioner, in handing over the affairs of the Protectorate, implored these officers not to have anything to do with such a man as Niekerk. The inexplicable and unheard-of course which was followed by the High Commissioner and his representatives, Captain Bower and Mr. Rhodes, led, strangely enough, to the existence of the court before which Mr. Niekerk himself has been arraigned. The Special Commissioner found in Vryburg a court open for the civil and criminal business of Stellaland, and open with the sanction of the High Commissioner. As to its power, it exists in connexion with a Government which issues titles to land and sanctions deeds of sale of land, and does so with the sanction and approval of the High Commissioner. In short, the Special Commissioner found that Stellaland had been virtually annexed by the High Commissioner, and Sir Charles at once availed himself of the legal machinery thus placed to his hand for the trial of the Administrator of Stellaland and some others who are said to be guilty of the murder of a young colonist of English parentage called Honey. It is already certain that Honey was never tried for—or, indeed, charged with—any capital offence. For reasons which will no doubt appear, it was resolved by those who are charged with the murder that Honey must be ""got rid of."" They tried to accomplish this end by getting him tried for cattle-stealing in the Transvaal, but this broke down; so they took him out of the Transvaal, brought him into a thicket, shot him down, and battered his head with stones. It is not asserted that Niekerk was present; but it is said that it can be established that what was done was by Niekerk’s written order. De la Rey and others of those chargeable in this dreadful affair have fled into the Transvaal, from which those who know Niekerk declare that he never willingly came away; and it is supposed that General Warren will request that these criminals, as well as the murderers of Bethell, shall be given up to be tried by a duly-appointed court of justice. The opposition of the present Cape Ministry will not take Sir Charles by surprise, as he knows that he left England expressly to alter wrong arrangements which they wished to make with the freebooters. His action in Stellaland at first took people by surprise. But now public confidence is unabated; people feel that for once ""murder will out,"" even in the Transvaal; and there is no deep feeling against what is being done. When this crime came before him Sir Charles was able to put the Transvaal to the test from Stellaland, and before dealing with Goshen. The manner in which all this has been done is calculated to deepen public confidence in Sir Charles, both as General and Special Commissioner. What the High Commissioner will do with reference to Mr. Van Niekerk, or how he will explain his virtual annexation of Stellaland and his placing Imperial affairs in Niekerk’s hands, and what Her Majesty’s Government and the English public will have to say about all this, are questions which people in South Africa are asking with considerable interest. Not furtive but real annexation ought at once to take place. Sir Charles ought to have the services of a colonial judge to adjudicate in such grave affairs; and the settlement of Bechuanaland ought to be accomplished under Imperial auspices before the country passes in the hands of those Colonial Ministers to rectify whose misdeeds in Goshen is one of the objects of the expedition.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters. The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage. The present system is a great injustice to Sierra Leone, and it is high time that it should be remedied.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.624, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sir John Pope Hennessy on the Crown Colonies', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, when he first went to the Mauritius he found a strong prejudice existing against British administration. The French population of the Colony had an affection for the Queen, but they had a great dislike to the Bureau Coloniale in London. What really the Colonies wanted was to have the management and control of their own local government. They thought they could transact their own business better than other people—better, even, than the Colonial Office in London. One certain remedy for the discontent that prevailed was to give to the Colonists far more control than was now permitted them over their own affairs. In fact, what they wanted was an extension of the principle of local self-government.\n\nBeyond that, he would like to suggest a reform nearer home. The Colonial Office, whether rightly or wrongly, was very unpopular in the West Indies and in our West African possessions, and in his opinion one great cause of that unpopularity was to be found in the fact that the department in London was not strong enough to deal with the large and important mass of business that came before it from the Colonies. No doubt they had a highly-trained body of men in the Colonial Office, some of them men of first-class ability; but then the total staff, including the Permanent Secretary, Assistant-Secretaries, and clerks, only numbered forty-eight. One grievance which the Crown Colonies had was in the matter of patronage, for all appointments, except those of over £200 a year, rested with the Colonial Office. This occasioned great indignation in the Colonies. The outcome of such a policy was that all the appointments were filled by strangers, and, as an illustration, he might mention that on his arrival in the Mauritius he found that of the eight official members of the Colonial Government only one was a Mauritian. What he had on the subject of Colonial patronage applied to all the Crown Colonies, and it was only too evident that some reform must be made in the direction of the reforms accomplished in the Home and Indian Civil Services.

Another powerful argument in support of this is as follows: The settlement of Lagos, although called the youngest of the settlements, has superior advantages over the other settlements. It has become a self-supporting settlement, without the cost of a penny to the British Government for the last few years. Although the settlement is only ten years old from the date of the cession, its revenue is no less than 50,000l. a-year, collected from a very moderate customs tariff; a revenue which is sufficient for carrying out its own government, and might leave a yearly surplus revenue to meet any emergency, were it only controlled by the people. The settlement is surrounded by tribes who are by far more intelligent, energetic, and enterprising than most of the West Coast tribes, and who have their own regularly-organised native governments with strong native military organisation (especially the Egba, Yoruba, and Jebu tribes), being able to march out at any time an army of 20,000 to 60,000 fighting men. It is therefore essentially necessary that the head of the executive of this settlement should have an unfettered action, subject only to the rule of the Colonial office, by which means he will command the greater respect and esteem of the powerful interior chiefs, who will look upon him as the direct representative of the Queen of England. If necessary, I can adduce proof that, since the creation of this central government, the chiefs of the surrounding countries have ceased to look up to the administrator in the same light of respect as the Queen's representative as they did in former times, consequently the prestige and influence of this government has become much more weak and impotent since 1866 than it was and would otherwise have continued to be. The prosperity of this settlement, and the rapid progress of civilisation and Christianity in this country, depend very much upon the free action of this Government; and any such action is entirely impotent in the eyes of the surrounding chiefs, so long as the head of the executive continues to be (as the native chiefs call it) a boy or subordinate of the Queen's representative at Sierra Leone."", 'last_edit_date': '1871-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1871#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

I cannot, however, refrain from telling the Colonel, through you, that there is really a very serious amount of discontent (to use a mild term) in these settlements among all classes of the people, and this feeling is likely to be greatly increased by a step which his Excellency has lately taken.

This has been done, as I positively know, by advice of the agent of a certain London firm, whose power on the Coast has hitherto been paramount. It cannot be said that this power and influence over the Colonial Government has, as a general rule, been exercised for evil.

Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

I believe I express the mind of my countrymen when I say that by self-government we simply desire some of those invaluable rights enjoyed by almost every community of British subjects—that is to say, to have the honour of saying nay or yes to those laws or rules of action by which our whole conduct as a people is guided, and most especially to have the privilege of managing, to some extent at least, our pecuniary affairs. In fact, Sir, the power of self-government for which we crave is but a shade better than what is termed in this country ""local,"" or ""parochial.""

Let them exercise their present authority to the fullest extent, and check any incursion we may dare to make into the laws through having power put into our hands.

Without questioning for one moment the kind feelings of the honourable gentlemen of the Council of Sierra Leone, I contend that, from the very nature of their appointments, being liable to be removed from one place to another, it is impossible for them to take the same interest in the colony as the native inhabitants. It naturally becomes a matter of very little importance to them whether any material improvement takes place in the colony or not; having to leave it in a comparatively short time. The painful consequence of this is, that we see many important schemes which might be for the well-being of the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are left undone. Mr. Editor, need I remind you of the intelligence which is brought to us by almost every mail, of the havoc the various kinds of fever are making amongst the different classes of the inhabitants of the colony? Is it, Sir, I ask, that these gentlemen are not aware of the principal cause of all this mischief? Do they not know that all this evil arises from the total absence of drainage and general sanitary improvements in the colony? It is not possible to conceive this. In fact, I should consider it an insult to every individual concerned to charge them with ignorance with respect to this matter. And yet, Sir, we see these most material improvements untouched. And why so? The answer is what I have intimated: It is not natural to man to labour for the sole benefit and enjoyment of others. And who will deny that if some of the native gentlemen, who know that the probable lengthening or shortening of their days hangs upon the existence or non-existence of these improvements, had the power of carrying them out, they would use their utmost efforts to do so?

This association has also suggested the appointment of native agents in all the treaty districts, whose business it should be to keep the Governor informed of all native movements tending towards war. This would enable him to take effectual action for their suppression, and he should be authorised to use the powers lodged in him for that purpose.

He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Possible Hostilities against Dahomey', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That the Local Government believe more in police and gaols, as you have observed, than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education, is self-evident; for whereas several thousands of pounds are annually voted to the former and expended, the few hundred pounds voted to the latter are doled out so niggardly and irregularly, that it seems almost a matter of regret an ordinance was ever passed in its favour.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters. Is it necessary to add that wherever such a state of things existed or may exist a colony is sure of being misgoverned?', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True
