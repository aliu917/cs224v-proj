61,"European colonial powers underestimated the challenges of maintaining an effective and stable military presence in Africa, leading to overstated loyalty and effectiveness of colonial forces and frequent invalidation of officers.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that European colonial powers underestimated the challenges of maintaining an effective and stable military presence in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights the reliance on indigenous troops, who often faced alienation and hostility from local populations, potentially undermining their loyalty and effectiveness. It also notes the denial of command positions to Africans, limiting their political role in independence movements and suggesting a lack of trust in African capabilities. Additionally, the scarcity of military resources during World War I forced European powers to divert troops to suppress local revolts, indicating challenges in maintaining control. However, the text emphasizes the logistical and military superiority of European powers, which allowed them to conquer Africa with relative ease, despite these challenges. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on the high rate of invalidation among officers due to illness, highlighting the insidious effects of the African climate on European forces and the necessity of sending many officers home. This underscores the underestimated challenges of maintaining a military presence and supports the notion of frequent invalidation of officers. The articles also discuss the inadequacy of some colonial administrators and the inefficiency of military establishments, suggesting overstated loyalty and effectiveness of colonial forces. While the articles do not explicitly address the loyalty of colonial forces, they provide evidence of the underestimated challenges and frequent invalidation of officers, complementing the textbook's nuanced view of both the challenges and advantages European powers faced in maintaining their colonial rule.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that align with the claim that European colonial powers underestimated the challenges of maintaining an effective and stable military presence in Africa.

By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': 'At a time when the Allied colonial regimes in Africa could least afford trouble in their own backyards, their authority - still only tenuously established in places like southern Ivory Coast, much of Libya, or Karamoja in Uganda - was widely challenged by armed risings and other forms of protest by their subjects. As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

It lacked the means of quick transportation to the scene of war. By 1880 it was divided into four regiments - one stationed in each county - each under an Americo-Liberian commander subordinated to the Liberian president, the army's commander-in-chief. 87 The typical condition of the militia was portrayed in President Barclay's description of its Fifth Regiment in May 1906 as: 'unsatisfactory: Colonel Carter, its commander, being also a preacher and absent constantly; the Lieutenant Colonel being illiterate; the major being deaf; the Regiment is rapidly going down and must be reconstructed'.$^{88}$ The LFF, no less inefficient than the militia, comprised in December 1913 three American and seven Liberian officers and over 600 enlisted men stationed in over a dozen detachments in the Liberian hinterland. Up to 1914, the officer commanding each detachment performed both military and administrative duties in his district. Consequently he received instructions from, and reported to both the Department of War and the Department of Interior (neither of which co-ordinated with the other).

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The causes of failure', 'content': ""Every case of resistance and armed insurrection went down to defeat, at least if one considers only the results at the scene of action. And yet the West Africans lacked neither courage nor military science. But they were at a heavy disadvantage in the face of the invaders. Apart from the technical superiority of their enemies' weapons, they had no real compensatory advantage over the conquerors. To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems. Finally, like Africans elsewhere, those of West Africa, except Samori, had to use outmoded weapons such as dane guns and bows and arrows in the face of cannon and the Maxim gun. In the combination of all these factors lay the source of the African defeat."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""The final and easily the most decisive factor was, of course, the over› whelming logistic and military superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa. While Europe was using professional and well-drilled armies, very few African states had established standing armies and fewer still had pro› fessional armies. Most African states recruited and mobilized individuals on an ad hoc basis for either defence or offence. Besides, in addition to their own armies, the European powers could always, as A. Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease. Indeed, for Europe, the timing of the conquest could not have been better; for Africa it could not have been worse."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': ""Fourthly, while the period after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-8 was marked, according to J. Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'However, within the next thirty years, this situation underwent a phe› nomenal and indeed a revolutionary change.

But it was not African sovereignty and independence alone that had been lost at that time. It represented also an assault on established cultures.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act.

They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose. Examples of these two developments are found among the Igbo of Nigeria, the Gikuyu of Kenya and the Langi of northern Uganda. ! 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place. However, policy ran a long gamut, from reluctant acceptance and forced adaptation of such structures as in Portuguese Angola and German East Africa, to considered efforts at institutional preservation as in British Northern Nigeria or French Morocco. Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as 'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of [and one may add subservience to] European powers' (Chapter 19).

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number. A similar comparison of the mortality amongst the black regiments employed respectively in the West Indies and on the West Coast (Return No. 30, Appendix), shows an average of deaths in the former of 23·92 per 1,000 against 32·19 per 1,000 in the latter. These returns do not certainly establish the objection that, compared with other stations on which our army and navy are called upon to serve, the West Coast of Africa is particularly fatal to life. No detailed information has been obtained respecting the loss by death of civil servants of the Government on the West Coast; but it may be stated that the loss of life from climate amongst this class is by no means large; the facility with which officers of all the services who suffer to any dangerous extent from disease are permitted to return home on sick leave, must operate to diminish considerably the number of fatal cases.\n\nThe expenditure of the Imperial Government for the settlements consists of a small grant in aid of their civil establishments, which averages about 12,000l. a-year, and of the cost of the military establishments required for their protection, an amount which varies with the strength of the force employed. Recent events on the Gold Coast had caused a considerable increase to be made to this force, but the present appearance of affairs seems to justify its reduction to about its usual strength.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MOSSAMEDES', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""During the past few months interest in the western shores of Africa has been growing apace. A congress has assembled in the capital of the greatest of European military Powers to debate on the future of Western Africa, and to apportion such portions of it as remained unannexed. A Free State, with a European monarch for its first sovereign, has arisen upon the foundations of a philanthropic association for the promotion of trade and industry. The days of native kings and potentates are at an end, and from the southern extremity of Morocco to the northern boundary of the Cape Colony, the western shores of the Dark Continent are now in the possession of European Powers; England, France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal having succeeded in obtaining a share of the general scramble. I have endeavoured, in this series of letters, to give some description of the most important points along the coast which promise to come more prominently into notice in the future, and, as the waste and uninhabited places of the earth become fewer and fewer to attract, a larger European community than it does at present. I have said in a former letter that the West Coast of Africa is emphatically a place to visit, but not to live in. This remark, however, must be taken to apply merely to the coast as it is at present circumstanced, with its miasma, malaria, mangrove swamps, and discomforts generally. Sanitation has, in other portions of the globe, triumphed over difficulties as great as these, and, so far as I can judge, there do not appear to be any insurmountable obstacles to making the West Coast of Africa a fairly healthy, if not an altogether pleasant, place to live in. I do not for a moment suppose that it is ever likely to become exactly a health resort, but it must be recollected that up to the present it has hardly had a fair trial. The men who, as a rule, have been sent to the West Coast of Africa are those who have come there as a dernier ressort. They have naturally enough, I suppose, regarded it as their earthly purgatory wherein to expiate their offences against society or their incapacity for doing anything for themselves. They have done uncommonly little up to the present for the West Coast of Africa, which is probably about the only part of the world that has not only not advanced, but generally, whenever it has been in the possession of European Powers, retrograded of late years. The Europeans resident on it have been content to exist there, have regarded the chances of life with philosophic indifference, as mere incidents of the climate, and have looked upon their time spent in those regions as a period of their life completely wasted, to be got through somehow or another. As a consequence of all this, nothing has been done to improve either the places, the people, or the surroundings. The British colonies on the West Coast of Africa are a disgrace to the British Empire. They are inferior in every respect to those of any other Power in that part of the world—a fact which is, in my opinion, due to their having hitherto been regarded as receptacles for the failures and ne'er-do-wells of the British Islands. Were they administered by capable men, instead of being looked on with equanimity as pest-houses to be avoided at any cost, they might long since have ceased to be pest-houses, and have become centres of a great trade with the interior, which they are most certainly not at present."", 'last_edit_date': '1886-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1886#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The expedition alluded to came first to Angra Pequeña; and their report is of such a nature as hardly to induce their countrymen to try their fortune at colonizing the place. To begin with, in their opinion, the copper mines—from which so much was to be expected—appear to be not worth the trouble of working; and next, the country between them and the coast is described as nothing but a dreary waste of sand hillocks, where neither water, fuel, nor food is obtainable; indeed, they estimate the cost of water delivered at the spot to be not less than thirty shillings per ton! After visiting Angra Pequeña, the expedition proceeded northward to the Kunene River, which they found to be broad and promising at its mouth, but narrowing considerably a very few miles inward, and completely cut off by sand hills in the dry season, and occasionally disappearing altogether. So not much could be hoped for in the navigation of this river! From here they proceeded, a distance of about two hundred and fifty miles, to N\'Gami, where the scenery presented a most pleasing contrast to any they had passed through before: with a beautiful lake, and ""villages swarming with peaceful and friendly natives, eager to trade."" But they were forced to the conclusion that the place is ""impossible"" for the German or any other colonist. The journey took a fortnight, and fodder for the oxen had to be brought along the whole way at an immense expense, and yet the beasts died off at an alarming rate. Altogether, they found the transport difficulties insuperable. After leaving N\'Gami, the expedition proceeded to the Congo, the first place they visited being the German station of Nokki, which they pronounced as quite desolate! It need scarcely be said that the dominions of the International Free State of the Congo came in for some rather unfavourable criticism—that was, perhaps, only to be expected under the circumstances. As we have observed above, this account from which we gather our facts does not profess to be the official report of the members of the expedition, but only the impression gathered by one of the party; and we await the official publication of the report with much interest. In all probability, these statements will be upheld, especially with regard to Angra Pequeña—being borne out by the fact that we may feel assured that had this place been worth holding, Great Britain would have assumed possession long ago. No mention appears to have been made, so far at least, of the recent German acquisitions further to the north—notably, the Cameroons, from the possession of which so much of advantage has been looked for. With regard to this part, it must not be forgotten that for a long time commercial intercourse has been regularly carried on; and thus the Cameroons may be made of much service to the Fatherland, as affording opportunity for colonization, and a focus from which German influence may be gradually extended along the coast. In this connexion it may be noticed that a regular service of steamers is now running between Hamburg and the Cameroons, calling also at other ports along the West Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-11-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_11_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CONGO FREE STATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On the other side, the _Indépendance Belge_ published the account of an interview of a member of its editorial staff with Dr. Allard, physician to the International African Association, who has returned here after a stay of three years in the Congo territory.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

Quite recently Mr. Tisdell, U.S. Consul in West Africa, published a report of a visit which he made to the Lower Congo, in which he painted so black a picture that no one seems to have given it much credit. Mr. Tisdell did not go beyond the threshold of the Free State, and his information was mostly at second-hand. The report which Lieutenant Taunt has to render bears a very different complexion. He did not content himself with a hurried visit to Vivi and Stanley Pool; he went up to Stanley Falls, the remotest station of the Free State. Lieut. Taunt speaks very freely of all he saw. He does not seek to conceal that he saw things which he could not approve. He found barren stretches on the Lower Congo, but even these are redeemed by fertile spots. He admits that the administration is not all that it should be, and that some of the officials do not seem fitted for their task, especially in the Lower Congo, where the officials are too frequently changed. (This, we believe, is their own fault, as the administration is extremely compliant in yielding to the wishes of discontented chiefs of stations.) As Lieut. Taunt proceeded up the river he became more and more satisfied with what he saw. From some of these stations he obtained superabundant supplies of European vegetables. At some stations cattle are reared with perfect success, and fresh meat is consequently abundant. Near one of the upper stations a feeding ground has been discovered frequented by immense herds of buffalo. Lieut. Taunt enjoyed perfect health during the whole of his journey, and with the commonest precautions, he maintains, there is no reason why white men should not keep in good condition. But he found the greatest imprudence among some officials, who seem heedless of the directions laid down by Mr. Stanley in his book. The only unfriendly natives he met with were near the mouth of the Aruwimi, and their hostility the traveller attributes to the fact that no station has been established among them. Indeed, he is of opinion that it would be to the interest of the Free State that these should be multiplied. He believes that on the Congo there are abundant resources to develop. On his way down he met with 500 natives who had been to the lower river with loads of ivory. The old ivory route, which struck off the river a considerable way up and made straight for the coast, has been abandoned, and diverted to the stations of the Association on the river itself.

Rarely did the peasants seek to solidify their initial gains or to shift their goals from an attack on the symbols of their oppression to an attack on the colonial system as a whole. As a rule, increased or more strictly enforced taxation and labour demands precipitated the uprisings. In the Zambezi valley between 1890 and 1905 at least sixteen different uprisings occurred. Most of these revolts were directed against the Companhia de Mozambique and the Companhia de ZambØsia to which Lisbon ceded most of central Mozambique. Both of these undercapitalized firms sought to maximize profits by imposing a heavy hut tax and exporting forced labour, policies which precipitated the uprisings.$^{53}$ During this period there were also several small-scale uprisings in Angola.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa.

So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation.

Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland. Therefore, distance from the coast was one of the determinants of how early the colonial economy could be set in motion.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

Only by uniting will you gain access to your rights'. Such were the ideas of James Africanus Horton, a Sierra Leonean, Joseph Smith, Henry Barnes, T. Hughes, F. L. Grant and R. J. Ghartey. Under the circumstances the coastal chiefs were very open to such arguments. They dreaded being attacked again by the Asante and were determined to contribute to their own defence, but they disapproved of the flabby attitude of the Dutch to Kumasi and its coastal ally, Elmina. They therefore opposed the exchange of forts that the British contemplated with the Dutch in order to make their respective territories homogeneous. However, they were also afraid of being abandoned by the British, who pressed them to unite against Asante in defence of the coast, but did not intend to give them the means to do so.

There is a tendency in the military element everywhere to be despotic and oppressive; and in our West African settlements it has had a pretty good field for the exercise of its selfish energies. In the comparative infancy of the British settlements, when the local revenues were very small, and there were no educated native people, it may have been necessary or convenient to confer certain civil government and magisterial offices upon military men in garrison. But the practice was so injurious that only very extreme necessity could ever justify it; and that necessity no longer anywhere exists. Military ascendancy on the West Coast is an unmitigated evil, and we shall oppose it until it be finally destroyed. If the officers in the British West India regiments employed one after another on the West Coast do not receive pay adequate to their services, let the Imperial Government increase their pay out of its own revenues, and not supplement it by injurious exactions on the revenues of the settlements. The officers of the West India Regiments are, for the most part,* men of very low mental calibre, and of very imperfect education, and among these Major Bravo, now in command in Sierra Leone, is perhaps one of the worst specimens. Is it not, then, a most atrocious injustice that because this creature of Major Blackall, the ex-Governor, was made by him stipendiary police magistrate, that he should still be allowed to insult, in this capacity, the people of Sierra Leone, among whom there are so many men so far his superiors, morally and intellectually, that it would be an insult to them to institute any comparison between him and them? On what possible ground can it be justified that such a man as Major Bravo should be saddled on the Sierra Leone revenues for 600l. a-year, only to extend his sphere of mischief in the capacity of a magistrate, and to give him power to insult such men as Mr. Rainy with impunity, to bring the military into increased odium with the community at large, and the administration of justice into loathing and contempt. To retain such a man in such an office at Sierra Leone, is a most unjustifiable insult to the people, is disgraceful to the British Government, and a gross plunder of the colonial revenues. Then, again, look at the performance of magisterial duties at Cape Coast by Colonel Delamaine Mends. Is not this something at which every man in authority in the office in Downing-street ought to blush (page 128). Does it not exhibit that the system of the British Government in the West African settlements is a system of plunder, and nothing else. If the Acting Administrator has the power to dictate to the magistrate what warrant he shall or shall not grant, and what his decisions are to be, is it not a despicable thing that a man should consent to be such a tool; a discreditable farce that there should be such a magistrate to be paid out of the local revenues at the rate of a guinea per hour? If the Acting Administrator possesses such power, why is it not ordered that he shall himself sit as magistrate, and save to the settlement the pay of a magistrate. It would be much more fair for the Government to say at once to all persons residing there, ""You will please to observe that you are to live under an irresponsible despotism, and to have no will but that of the governor, and no redress for anything you may suffer from him."" Men would be able to understand this; but they cannot understand such a system as actually prevails, while being told at the same time that they are living under the protection of British laws. We are sorry to have to mention the name of Captain Russell, at Accra, in conjunction with two such military magisterial specimens as Major Bravo and Colonel Mends, because we have before heard much in his praise; but ""Roll him out"" is not the sort of language that will cause the Administrator or the administration of justice to be respected.

The officers returned on board, and I suppose —— must have been under alcoholic influence, or he would not have shown such selfish and brutal passion to the poor boatmen, who only asked to be compensated for taking him on board, or have assaulted and abused the merchant\'s clerks who went to discharge their employers\' cargo brought out by the steamer. Listen to this officer of Her Majesty Queen Victoria: \'I do not care a —— about black niggers, and I am determined to kill one before I am satisfied.\' —— also assaulted the policeman and Customs officers who were on duty on board the Volta, as is customary; and we are told that the authorities declined to grant any redress to the poor Customs\' House officers. Is it not wrong that there should be no redress for persons thus unwarrantably treated? Fortunately, however, his Excellency sent for the military officers to come on shore again, and we saw —— and other officers coming on shore in civilian\'s dress, when our people took the matter into their own hands, and as soon as —— landed from the boat, the black niggers fell upon him and gave him such blows that he fell flat on the beach. When we saw him soon afterwards, he was, with his pocket-handkerchief on his bleeding nose, on his way to Government House. I am sure —— will remember Bathurst, River Gambia, and, in particular, the black niggers\' blows. We do not think that the steamer\'s officers should have allowed such brutal treatment of clerks who went for their employers\' cargo on board, but we suppose they did not dare to interfere with a Queen\'s officer.""', 'last_edit_date': '1875-07-19', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Classified medical returns of the colonial hospitals, Sierra Leone, for thirteen years, are in the possession of the Statistical Society.

He says: ""They are generally runaway slaves, yet discipline and their elevation from serfs to freemen soon enable them to appreciate their improved position. When claimed by their owners (a circumstance which is constantly occurring), an arrangement is made to indemnify them, and redeem the slave by the payment of 8l. sterling, that sum being deducted by instalments from the man\'s pay. Their services during the Kroboe revolt, in 1858, and disturbance in the Abra district, in 1859, showed their value as soldiers."" It is, therefore, with no small regret that we have lately had occasion to refer to the mutinous conduct of these men; but judging from all we have heard of the cause of their insubordination, the conclusion has forced itself upon our minds that these outbreaks never would have occurred had their officers known how to govern them and obtain their respect; and should the cause of these mutinies ever be adequately inquired into, we have strong reason for believing it would then be found that, however guilty the men may have been, they have been sinned against as well as sinning.\n\nMr. Clarke thus describes the privileges enjoyed by the officers of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps; but before quoting further from his paper on this head, we may remark that he has overlooked one of their most valued privileges—viz., that they undergo no preliminary examination prior to being appointed. This escape from the ordeal or test of efficiency should, we conceive, be no longer tolerated, as it has unquestionably led to the admission of men of inferior attainments:—\n\n""The officers have the privilege of holding civil appointments, and promotion is very rapid, not so much from death vacancies as from officers being transferred to other regiments of the line, or from retiring on half-pay.

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number. A similar comparison of the mortality amongst the black regiments employed respectively in the West Indies and on the West Coast (Return No. 30, Appendix), shows an average of deaths in the former of 23·92 per 1,000 against 32·19 per 1,000 in the latter. These returns do not certainly establish the objection that, compared with other stations on which our army and navy are called upon to serve, the West Coast of Africa is particularly fatal to life. No detailed information has been obtained respecting the loss by death of civil servants of the Government on the West Coast; but it may be stated that the loss of life from climate amongst this class is by no means large; the facility with which officers of all the services who suffer to any dangerous extent from disease are permitted to return home on sick leave, must operate to diminish considerably the number of fatal cases.\n\nThe expenditure of the Imperial Government for the settlements consists of a small grant in aid of their civil establishments, which averages about 12,000l. a-year, and of the cost of the military establishments required for their protection, an amount which varies with the strength of the force employed. Recent events on the Gold Coast had caused a considerable increase to be made to this force, but the present appearance of affairs seems to justify its reduction to about its usual strength.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'RECOMPENSE TO NATIVE OFFICIALS FOR SERVICES DURING THE WAR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have to bear the burden of many griefs and sorrows. The cries of those who suffer injustice are ever filling our ears. As Editor of the African Times, we are supposed to have the power to redress every wrong and remove every grievance under which people may be suffering on the West Coast of Africa. There is in this a great tribute to the power of an independent public press, as well as to us in our editorial capacity; and we can only deplore that our success is not always on a par with our desires as regards the matters in which we are implored to render aid. Without being thus implored, we felt it to be a duty last month to bring prominently under notice the insufficient recognition and non-requital of most efficient and important services performed by the Bonny Contingent during Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s march to Kumasi. We take this opportunity to call official attention anew to what we then urged as being due to Prince Charles Peppel, Mr. Jumbo, and the tried valiant men whom they so successfully led in that Ashanti Expedition. Such just claims have, we feel convinced, only been accidentally overlooked, not wilfully neglected, and will be recognized and satisfied. We are only sorry that it should have been at all necessary again to remind Her Majesty\'s Government of them. In that reminder we laid it down as an axiom that ""a great country should never be unmindful of services rendered, or defer the reward due to those who have rendered them;"" and put forward the incontrovertible fact, that the greatest States and Governments have their times of perplexity and need, when the feeble aid of others, who are very insignificant in their eyes, may be of great importance. What we then applied as regards the services of a body of men, we now apply as regards an individual. We are pained to say that there has been, owing to what cause we know not, a lack of proper consideration as regards individual claims at Cape Coast, since the happy conclusion of the late war. Many instances have been brought under our notice, but although we had no doubt as to the reality of the wrong complained of, the circumstances were such as required more examination than we could possibly make, before we could have felt justified in publicly calling attention to them. The friends, however, of a man named G. B. Duker, have placed his case before us in a way that fully justifies our notice of it. Among the many extraordinary duties that had to be performed during the war, there was one of great importance; that was, the faithful and diligent receipt and transmission of despatches and other communications from and to the army in the field. We heard so many praises at the time of the regularity and unswerving assiduity and faithfulness with which that service was performed, that we must confess we were under the impression that they were performed by some European official, who had been specially detailed to the office of Military Postmaster. We now find we were in error on this point, and that the person placed in that most responsible position is a native of the Gold Coast—one who has never been in England, but who has obtained the knowledge he possesses, and the acquirements which enabled him to discharge such duties, in the Wesleyan Missionary Schools there. Most important official despatches and letters, were daily and hourly, passing through his hands, and he was solely responsible for them. They were the despatches and letters, as his friends remind us, ""to and from the British Government and the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Garnet Wolseley; Sir Garnet Wolseley\'s Staff, the 42nd Highlanders, the 23rd Fusiliers, the Rifle Brigade, the Naval Brigade, the 1st and 2nd West India Regiments, Colonel Wood\'s Native Regiment, Major Russell\'s Regiment, the Cape Coast Rifle Corps, the Army Service Corps, the Army Medical Corps, and the Royal Engineers. All their important and official despatches, letters, and correspondence passed safely through his hands, more especially those from headquarters at the front, and the commanding officers at their respective posts, en route to Kumasi."" After perusing this list, we are not surprised to learn that the work to be performed, and which was faithfully and punctually performed, was an arduous one, entailing great personal sacrifices on the individual in question.

All the time we were talking about the Ashanti war, it was mere child\'s play; it is now that there is war. On the 5th instant—a never-to-be-forgotten day—from 9 o\'clock in the morning, the bush people commenced coming into town with their property, their children, their sick, aged, lame, blind, wounded, and killed. It was a dreadful sight to witness. Between 2 and 7 o\'clock, the influx of people was indeed great, and the effluvia arising as they passed was awful. The crowd was so thick, that the poor people were almost treading on each other; the very little were being dragged along; all rushing to Cape Coast for safety, for the Ashantis were pursuing them. The men who went to fight also returned, every one of them, in great fright and confusion. The excitement was intense. The people were flocking in all night long; and there was such weeping and wailing all night. Some missed their wives, some their husbands, and others their children; and others again their money and other things. We had no sleep that night, and on the morning of the 6th the excitement was worse. The Ashantis were said to be only five miles from Cape Coast—that is, at Sweet River. A great many warriors went out, but returned again. On that day they brought nine Ashantis altogether—six living ones, a seventh very badly wounded (he said the Ashantis were determined to come to Cape Coast to fight), and the heads of two others. Two men\'s heads were cut off at Sweet River, a third by Mr. Taylor\'s farm. On the 7th, it was reported that Ashantis were at Mrs. Barne\'s farm, at Aboom, and at Salt Pond near us. You can just imagine what a panic the town was in: people running every way; some going into town, some going up street. All the brick-sheds were occupied by the bush people; they cook and sleep all about in the streets. Our cellar under the balcony is thick with people. The people from Commenda (the other side of Elmina) are all coming to Cape Coast. The Ashantis are after them, too; they cannot pass through Elmina, as the Elmina people do not like them, so they come by water, and every day some of them die at the landing. In one hour eight boats were sunk; the other day five men were drowned; the day before that, two; yesterday one. Mr. F. C. Grant kindly sent a sailing-vessel to bring the women; she brought 300 of them yesterday, and is going back for more. The water the bush people drink is enough to kill them, and there has been no rain for some time now. They begin to die already. Yesterday they buried two in the field near us. There is never any market now at all; they have rooted up all the plants everywhere. On Tuesday, the 10th June, we had a very heavy shower of rain, of which the bush people were all very glad. Yesterday they buried two bush people again in the field. The sea is so rough that I do not think I shall be able to come. All the soldiers\' wives are going to be sent to Sierra Leone, except four. There are 100 white soldiers now in the Castle, and the West Indian troops are expected. The Ashantis are said to be at Elmina now. All that part of Elmina that are for the English and the British Subjects, are all in the Castle there now. Achampong and other Ashantis are in the town. The man-of-war, Druid, is gone there this morning to watch their movements. They passed many people with small-pox on the day they came to town, all naked. The Ashantis have captured a great many Fantis and some Cape Coast people; some were killed, others taken to Coomassie. The merchants and the educated natives have formed themselves into a company, and go patrolling every night; besides, other patrols go out; the Houssas go out also. The people that came into the town on the 5th were said to be about 20,000, but I think they must have been more; and from that day to this they are coming in from all parts; but some of them have left Cape Coast and gone to Anamaboe and other places, as they could not get food here.""', 'last_edit_date': '1873-06-10', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_07_1873#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

In the first place, as S.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed.

However a brief account of the military campaigns is essential if we are fully to understand the implications of the war for Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'of the most powerful states, ethnic particularism, and internal cleavages among the ruling strata or class and occasionally, between it and their subject population.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Military systems', 'content': 'One major effect of this growing importance of European firearms was the relative decline of cavalry as the elite and striking force in areas where it had been important and its replacement by a European-style armed infantry. In the forest areas and in places influenced by Nguni warfare, the traditional elite was already the infantry. Here the main trends of the nineteenth century were the training and increasing professionalism and subsequent introduction of European armaments to this infantry. In the widespread movement of peoples, such as followed the Mfecane or the collapse of the Old Oyo empire, sometimes a people in a scrubland area hitherto depending on cavalry moved into a more forested area where cavalry warfare was difficult, and this further encouraged the decline of cavalries. Some of the states in direct confrontation with European settlers, having a tradition of mounted riflemen, bred ponies for fast movement, organized importation of European arms and created new armies that for a while had the balance of power on their side. In much of the rest of Africa and especially the Sudan, where for centuries the cavalry had been the core and the elite of the armies, trained, professional foot soldiers armed with rifles rose to become the elite force. The cavalry was beginning to be relegated to the second line of defence and reserve. This sharpened the revolution in the military systems in Africa and had important social and economic implications that all helped to strengthen the ruler as the chief executive of the state.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us. Furthermore, the uneven nature of the distribution of educational facilities prevented a uniform process of modernization in each colony, which further accentuated differences and tensions between ethnic groups and regions. These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'Secondly, while admitting that the new geo-political set-up that emerged was an asset even though an accidental one, it nevertheless created far more problems than it solved. Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language. The problems of nation-building posed by such a medley of peoples have not proved to be easily soluble.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ... Overnight, African political states lost their power, independence and meaning. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 26, 'article_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '10-14-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_11_1862#article-5', 'issue_date': '22_11_1862', 'content': ""Sir,—The Government here is still very feeble. There has been a mutiny again of the Gold Coast Corps; indeed, their normal condition is mutiny and insubordination. They are allowed to plunder, attack and insult the people at will. The soldiers at Christiansborg, Accra, make it a regular practice to go out on the road in broad daylight, and commit plain highway robbery, forcibly taking away live stock and any other description of property they can find from the passers-by.\n\nThe last mutiny, above alluded to, occurred on Friday, the 3rd inst. The corps has been disorganised for many months, and the men were at any time ready for a small spree when an opportunity occurred. A soldier of the corps, while on duty as sentry in the castle at Cape Coast, struck a girl with his musket. He was ordered by Mr. O'Callaghan, the magistrate before whom he was brought up, to be flogged, and the punishment was inflicted publicly outside the gates of the castle. In the evening the men assembled and marched out of the castle with their band, and went to a place called Napoleon, five miles distant from here, and situated in the bush. The Government here (so called out of courtesy), consisting of three or four gentlemen, were exceedingly alarmed. Some chiefs and native gentlemen of Cape Coast succeeded at last in bringing back the mutineers, 170 in number, and most of them have been sent up to Sierra Leone in a man-of-war. The castle is now garrisoned by some sailors and marines from vessels of war and the Cape Coast Volunteers, a native force, who, although greatly despised and ridiculed some time ago by some officers of the Gold Coast Corps, have rendered efficient service since the late mutiny. The complaints of the mutineers are many. I presume there is an end of this dreadful Gold Coast corps. Thank God!\n\nAt Accra, when the news of the mutiny reached that place, the commandant, Major De Ravignes, acted with great energy and discretion, calling on all the merchants and head men to bring in their people to be sworn in as special constables. This call was promptly responded to. Patrols paraded the town all night and every night, and sentinels were placed at various places. Nothing, however, occurred.

It appears that there is an impression on the minds of the people in some of the villages where the road-tax had been commenced that the tax is collected from them to make good the streets, &c., of Freetown; because after the tax had been collected from those who could pay, the defaulters were called upon to clean the roads in the best way they could; so that work which was formerly done by the whole of the villagers is thrown upon a comparatively few defaulters.

The exclusive intelligence to be found in our columns will well repay perusal. We fear there is no doubt of an Ashantee war. Imperfect as our system (if it merit the name of a system) on the Gold Coast is, the comparative security of life there has long been gradually draining Ashantee of a portion of its population. Slaves seek refuge there, rather than be slaughtered and buried in a dead chief's grave. Is any chief or headman summoned to Comassie in a manner that causes him to dread a fatal termination to his journey, he prefers to migrate to the protected territories with his willing followers. If the British Government had fully comprehended its inevitable mission on the Gold Coast, the active influences of civilization would long ere this have penetrated Ashantee, and such a war as is now imminent, or actually commenced, would have been impossible. Had there been roads from the coast to the Ashantee frontier, every police post at their terminus would have been a radiating centre of civilising influences. We think that on the first symptoms of approaching trouble with Ashantee, the Gold Coast authorities ought to have called upon the chiefs to open up military paths, if not roads, through their districts. Now we suppose every man is engaged as a soldier. The people have to defend their homes. But when this war shall have finished, roads must be made, and such changes as may be requisite in the character of our occupation there in order to enable this to be effected must be ordered. A wave of civilization must have way made for it to roll on from the seacoast to the Kong Mountains. We are sorry not to have heard of any proclamation forbidding the Fantees and other people of the protected territories to slaughter and decapitate their prisoners. It is not creditable to us that it should be thought pleasant to our authorities on the coast to have human heads sent to them. We are in Africa to civilise, and to countenance barbarous practices is not the way to civilise. Again, if the quarrel proceed to full and widespread hostilities, we hope the small British force there will be under good leadership. We confess to great misgivings on this point. The state of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps does not inspire us with any confidence in those who have allowed that formerly fine, well-behaved body of men to lose all discipline and subordination.

He says: ""They are generally runaway slaves, yet discipline and their elevation from serfs to freemen soon enable them to appreciate their improved position. When claimed by their owners (a circumstance which is constantly occurring), an arrangement is made to indemnify them, and redeem the slave by the payment of 8l. sterling, that sum being deducted by instalments from the man\'s pay. Their services during the Kroboe revolt, in 1858, and disturbance in the Abra district, in 1859, showed their value as soldiers."" It is, therefore, with no small regret that we have lately had occasion to refer to the mutinous conduct of these men; but judging from all we have heard of the cause of their insubordination, the conclusion has forced itself upon our minds that these outbreaks never would have occurred had their officers known how to govern them and obtain their respect; and should the cause of these mutinies ever be adequately inquired into, we have strong reason for believing it would then be found that, however guilty the men may have been, they have been sinned against as well as sinning.\n\nMr. Clarke thus describes the privileges enjoyed by the officers of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps; but before quoting further from his paper on this head, we may remark that he has overlooked one of their most valued privileges—viz., that they undergo no preliminary examination prior to being appointed. This escape from the ordeal or test of efficiency should, we conceive, be no longer tolerated, as it has unquestionably led to the admission of men of inferior attainments:—\n\n""The officers have the privilege of holding civil appointments, and promotion is very rapid, not so much from death vacancies as from officers being transferred to other regiments of the line, or from retiring on half-pay.

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number. A similar comparison of the mortality amongst the black regiments employed respectively in the West Indies and on the West Coast (Return No. 30, Appendix), shows an average of deaths in the former of 23·92 per 1,000 against 32·19 per 1,000 in the latter. These returns do not certainly establish the objection that, compared with other stations on which our army and navy are called upon to serve, the West Coast of Africa is particularly fatal to life. No detailed information has been obtained respecting the loss by death of civil servants of the Government on the West Coast; but it may be stated that the loss of life from climate amongst this class is by no means large; the facility with which officers of all the services who suffer to any dangerous extent from disease are permitted to return home on sick leave, must operate to diminish considerably the number of fatal cases.\n\nThe expenditure of the Imperial Government for the settlements consists of a small grant in aid of their civil establishments, which averages about 12,000l. a-year, and of the cost of the military establishments required for their protection, an amount which varies with the strength of the force employed. Recent events on the Gold Coast had caused a considerable increase to be made to this force, but the present appearance of affairs seems to justify its reduction to about its usual strength.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

After three weeks on board ship, we were glad to get ashore at Accra. On landing, I was taken to Christiansborg, and introduced to the Governor and other officials. Having got into harness, I began my duties, and found that my mode of conveyance from one place to another was by go-cart. The arrangement consists of a small hand-cart on two wheels, drawn, as a rule, by one Kroo boy, and pushed behind by another, or a couple more. I was not a little surprised and pleased to find, on my first visit (Saturday), that cricket was going on, the match being Whites v. Blacks. Some of the Natives play very well, and take great interest in the game. After about a month\'s stay I started on my first trip through the bush. A hammock and eight carriers, besides six men for carrying luggage, are allowed for this expedition; and one is carried, lying full length in the hammock, at the rate of about four miles an hour. Having received instructions, I pushed on as fast as possible to take over the duties of Commissioner for a large district. These duties are many, and not at all times the most pleasant. They consist, in the first place, of magisterial work—i.e., sitting daily in court and distributing justice to the offenders; next, coroner\'s work; also performing marriages, accounting for all moneys received in Customs duties, paying all officials in the district, and if belonging to the constabulary, commanding the Hausas and civil police at the station. In fact, a District Commissioner is monarch of all he surveys. Some of those holding the office are Natives. After three months of such work, I was ordered into Accra. The Hausa force, composed of European and Native officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, are well able to hold their own, as far as Native troops go. The Native officers are fine men, nearly all having seen service, and wearing medals for campaigns as well as for distinguished conduct in the field. The non-commissioned officers and men receive extra pay for good conduct. Several of the non-commissioned officers have been to England, for instruction at Hythe, Shoeburyness, and Knellar Hall; and it is the custom to send a number every year at the expense of the Colony. One company is told off as gunners, and work the several 7-pounders, &c., receiving extra pay. The drums and fifes are very good; and the buglers it would be hard to beat. The headquarters are at Accra, but there are detachments at all the large stations. One sees the value of the Hausas when they are sent on an expedition, no commissariat or baggage-waggons being required. The men are simply paid 3d. a day as subsistence money, and they find themselves. They are well drilled, and are armed with the Martini-Henry short carbine for bushwork. The whole, or nearly the whole, of the Hausa force are Mohammedans, and their souls are cared for by their priests, who belong to the force, and are paid by the Colony. The men are recruited from the following tribes, viz.: Hausa, Wongora, Dagomba, Meshi, Fulas, Dagotahs, Grunshis, Grumas, and Yombas. The civil police force consists of about 350 men, mostly Fantis. They are in uniform, and perform the duties of policemen, as at home. There are an inspector and two sub-inspectors at the head of the civil police, and the work is carried on as satisfactorily as can be expected out of the material provided.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'.

H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

Initially, market considerations were the most decisive factor. As production grew in the Maghrib to keep pace with the rate of industrialization in Europe, prices fell accordingly and the terms of trade deteriorated. Under the harsh economic conditions of the times, competition became progressively fiercer and European policies for expansion overseas became more aggressive. 15 As early as 1816, the British fleet under Lord Exmouth was despatched to North Africa and this was repeated in 1819 under Admiral Freemantle with the co-operation of the French naval division of Admiral Jurien, in order to notify the 'Barbary' powers of the ban that had been placed on privateering by a concerted decision of the European nations. This osten› sibly noble purpose, however, concealed rapacious intentions, since sub› stantial commercial privileges were demanded by the French, especially on behalf of their countrymen living in Provence, and by the British on behalf of their Italian and Spanish clients, who were in competition with the French. This marked the beginning of an ultimately highly successful policy aimed at securing the submission of the North African countries to Europe's ever-growing economic and political demands.$^{16}$ Instructions given to the new French consul who was sent to Tunis at the head of a squadron in 1824 stressed 'the necessity of establishing relations with this inferior power [the Regency] which are more in keeping with the dignity and interests of the kingdom [of France]'.$^{17}$ European, and particularly French trade, derived the greatest benefit from this 'necessity', since it was enabled to expand rapidly by exceptionally advantageous facilities provided by a system that was revoltingly unfair.

'If there were no Barbary pirates, they would have to be invented', exclaimed one of the French merchants established in Tunis.$^{18}$ Another factor that came into play was the sense of 'national honour', for various aspirations could be satisfied or failures compensated for with only a minimum of risk in the Maghrib.

But the struggle was resumed again in the 1880s, partly because of the entry of Germany into the race and partly because of renewed invasions by Dahomey which increased the determination of the rulers of Porto Novo and the states of western Yorubaland to seek protection from the French or the British. The French conquest of Dahomey in 1892, the AngloFrench Partition of Borgu in 1895, the extension of British rule over the rest of Yorubaland and their conquest of Benin in 1897 must be seen as the logical conclusion of the Anglo-French rivalry of the 1860s, itself provoked by the pre-existing unities of the hinterland of the ports the European powers tried to control on the coast.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.585, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'The events that marked the real turning point, however, were the formal annexation of Lagos to the British Crown in 1861 and a British naval action against Porto Novo later the same year.$^{34}$ These two British actions naturally sensitized the French, who had considerable commercial interests in Whydah and Porto Novo. Encouraged by Porto Novo itself, a French protectorate was declared over this coastal Aja state in 1863 to check further British advance along the coast to the west. Both the British and the French soon discovered the obvious: that the real value of Lagos or Porto Novo was to be measured in terms of the trade with the hinterland in the Yoruba and Aja interior which the two ports shared. This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities. In this Anglo-French rivalry, western Yorubaland became the main theatre because of the positive response of the local peoples, who saw in the European interventions the solution to the problem of the continuous invasion of their area by their more powerful neighbours.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New patterns of European intervention in the Maghrib', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Commercial expansion and the struggle for control over the world's trade routes were among the most marked characteristics of European colonialism in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

If Neapolitan sailing ships were making for the coast and caught sight of a Tunisian or Tripolitanian flag, their crews were quick to make their escape.

The French occupation of Algeria shattered the economic unity of North Africa by deflecting trans-Saharan trade to routes east and west of Algeria and by disrupting east-west caravan traffic along the northern fringe of the desert. The advance of the French army was a direct and immediate manifestation of the impact of Europe, a presence more remote if no less real elsewhere because of the shifting volume and composition of trans-Saharan trade. By the end of the century trans-Saharan trade, with the revenue and ready supply of labour it brought, had all but collapsed. The importance of this trade in the lives of nomads suggests the need for further research on the effects of shifts in commerce and its decline: what was the effect of the formation of the state ruled by 'Abd al-Kädir astride a major east-west route? How precisely did desert people react to shifts in commerce? How did declining trade affect resistance? The French occupation of the desert also introduced a new military factor in the relationship between desert oeople and the outside world. The mobility of nomads allowed a number >f options in resistance that might coalesce around Muslim leaders and .eligious orders, but the arid environment often limited the freedom of groups or individuals with shared resources by presenting them with a choice between resistance and survival.

Nor could the Moroccans stand up to the French army, which exerted pressure on the frontier with Algeria and sometimes pursued dissident groups into Moroccan territory. The pre-Saharan fringe of Morocco belonged to the biläd al-sibä, or land of dissidence, but this translation obscures long-standing and important economic, religious and social ties between siba and Makhzen, the territory where the sultan could collect taxes and exert his authority. Morocco enjoyed the informal protection of the British, who controlled the lion's share of Moroccan import-export trade, and British interest in Morocco helped to postpone the French takeover. In efforts to protect their territory beyond the Atlas, Moroccan sultans took care to throw into relief existing political and diplomatic ties with the south-east. Even if Moroccan sultans could not tax or control nomadic groups beyond the Atlas, they could enter into local politics by throwing their weight behind one faction or another, by mediating disputes, or by capitalizing on their prestige as religious leaders. The religious influence of the Moroccan sultan extended as far as the Niger bend; the Kunta shaykh Ahmad al-Bekkai, leader of the Kâdirïyya in the Sudan, recognized Mawlay 'Abd al-Rahmän as imam of all Muslims and carried on diplomatic correspondence with the Moroccan crown. 11 The real significance of the French occupation of the Algerian desert was that it was a phenomenon of an entirely new order. It was far more permanent than the occasional expeditions of the Moroccan sultan into the desert, journeys whose main purpose was to make and renew acquaintances with important local people. It also contrasted sharply with the infrequent visits of Ottoman officials to the oases of Cyrenaica and with the Ottoman policy of leaving the nomads to themselves except for occasional attempts to tip the balance in disputes between groups.

Between the French territory and the mouth of the Congo, some 350 miles, the coast at present is chiefly occupied by petty native kingdoms, which will doubtless soon be absorbed, probably by France. Along this coast there are several small settlements belonging to various Powers; at Setti Camma are some British factories; at the mouth of the Kevilu are both Dutch and English factories; at Punta Negra is the station recently occupied by the French; at Chinchoxo is a Dutch factory; and just south of the last-named is Landana, which, with the adjoining territory, was placed under Portuguese authority by treaty with the native chiefs in December last.

The question under discussion is one of those curious points which sometimes arise in treaties relating to countries of which maps can give only an approximately correct idea. For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands. It is the neck of the bottle through which the trade of the colony flows, and this is recognised by the French no less than by the English colonists. France is therefore doing her utmost to obtain such a modification of the Convention above referred to as will give her control over this trade centre. The bait held out to our Government is some concession in that no-man\'s-land, the region around Lake Chad. Meanwhile the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are alarmed at the danger which threatens their trade, and have pointed out to Lord Salisbury and Lord Knutsford that Sierra Leone is of great strategical importance to the Empire, and that the cession of Fararma to France, by enabling the French to deflect the trade to their Senegal and Niger colonies, must result in the destruction of the commerce of Sierra Leone and in its eventually being absorbed into the French colonies, by which it is even now almost entirely hemmed in.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRANCE AND ENGLAND ON THE NIGER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The third and fourth routes, from the Upper Niger and the Ivory Coast respectively, may be treated together, as they involve the same insuperable difficulty—that of exercising effective commercial or military influence in Central Africa at a considerable distance from either the sea, a navigable waterway, or an already settled, developed and, therefore secure inland base of operations. France, whose Senegal Colony dates from the seventeenth century, was able gradually to establish her power on the banks of that river up to Kayes, the highest navigable point. Thence during many years of alternate energy and abandonment, which afford a striking example of the costly wastefulness of State vacillation, a few miles of railway have been constructed to Bafoulaba, further up the river. It is said that this short railway involves a heavy annual cost to prevent its being submerged by sand-drifts. In 1881 there commenced a period of great military activity under the able and energetic Colonels Desbordes, Gallieni and Archinard. A succession of brilliant expeditions have enabled France to establish a line of military posts from Bafoulaba to Bamaku on the navigable stream of the Upper Niger, on which have been placed three posts up to Kurusa and two down to Niamina. Treaties have been made with Samory and Ahmadu, two of the most powerful native rulers, which, under the principles of international comity, probably give France rights in those regions as against other European States; but they do not—at any rate as yet—give her a secure basis of operations from which to commence, without the aid of a navigable river, even a military occupation of the 500 miles which separate Bamaku from the western frontier of the Sokoto Empire. On the contrary, the French position on the Upper Niger itself must long be one of watchful defence. Ahmadu is again at war with France, while the attitude of Samory is such as to demand serious sacrifices to defend the position even on the Senegal River. I am informed on good authority that not one French commercial establishment has been placed on the Upper Niger, so that the considerable expenditure of lives, heroism and money during the past ten years, has as yet been fruitless. The truth is that France has before her a herculean labour in pacifying, effectively occupying and developing the great triangle, 250,000 square miles in area, of which the seaboard from Cape Blanco to Mellicoree forms the western side; a line from Cape Blanco to Niamina, the north-eastern side; and the Upper Niger, from Niamina to Kurusa (with a prolongation to Mellicoree), the south-eastern side.

But there has been a dispute for years between France and Spain as to the possession of an area of some 50,000 square miles on the river Muni, to the north of the Gaboon, at the head of the Bay of Corisco, embracing a coast-line of over 100 miles, extending from the Rio Campos to Cape Santa Clara. A joint Commission is now sitting in Paris for the purpose of settling the question. Spain claims that her rights extend into the interior as far as the river Mobangi. France disputes this claim, and is only prepared to allow Spain a small area on the coast. The claims of Spain to the Muni region are of somewhat old date. By a treaty concluded with Portugal in 1777, the latter ceded to Spain the islands of Fernando Po and Annobon, as also the right to trade on the coast between the mouths of the Niger and Cape Lopez, a coast-line which Portugal claimed as belonging to her. Many years since Spanish traders settled on Corisco Island, and had stations on the opposite coast, which were used as depôts for slaves from the interior till they could be shipped across the Atlantic. In 1843 the chiefs of Corisco Island, as well as those on the opposite coast, north and south of the Muni, according to Spanish authorities, formally recognised the sovereignty of Spain. How far the jurisdiction of these chiefs extends is the point to be settled by the joint Commission. The French have had to intervene at various times to maintain order in the district which is claimed by Spain, and maintain that the area to which Spain has any real claim is a mere patch on the coast round Cape St. Jean. France does not contest the claim of Spain to Corisco Island, though she doubts her right to the Elobey islands, in which are French and German factories. A Spanish expedition penetrated many miles into the interior from the river Benito, and professed to have made large annexations. As a matter of fact both French and Spanish gunboats traverse the Muni, on the banks of which the flags of the two countries alternate. It is not probable that much difficulty will be found in coming to a compromise which will give France the lion's share of the territory in dispute. At the same time advantage may be taken of the meeting of the Commission to arrange for a definite delimitation of the Spanish claims on the south of Morocco, which cover some 240,000 square miles, and which may be found to be in the way of French railway projects from Algeria to Senegal."", 'last_edit_date': '1891-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1891#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The French Occupation of Boussa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the first place, it may not be altogether superfluous to recall the situation of Boussa, which lies to the north and north-east of Dahomey, in the back country of the Guinea coast, and stretches along the right bank of the Middle Niger for a considerable distance above the rapids which mark the dry-season limit of the river navigation. Boussa is the more important as a riverain State because it is independent of the adjoining empire of Sokoto. British authority upon the River Niger is delegated wholly to the Royal Niger Company, and it must be remembered as a principle of international law that the possession of a charter from any civilised Government gives validity as against the acts of other civilised Governments to native treaties negotiated with the holder of the charter. The Royal Niger Company obtained its charter in 1886. From that date treaties negotiated by it with the Native authorities and accepted by the British Government have international validity. The authority and position of the Niger Company in the sphere claimed by it for British influence have from the beginning rested upon this treaty basis. Force has only been used, as in the late campaign, to maintain the absolutely essential principle of respect for treaties. In the few years immediately succeeding the acquisition of the charter the activity of the Company was mainly directed to the negotiation of political treaties with the native Sultans, Emirs, and petty chiefs. A web of treaty rights was in this manner spread with the consent of the local authorities over the entire area which is now known as the territory of the Company, and when in 1890 the question of a definite delimitation of French and British spheres of influence was discussed between the Governments of the two countries concerned the treaties negotiated by the Royal Niger Company were taken as forming the legitimate basis of the British claim. They covered at that time a territory extending to 500 miles above Say, on the Upper Niger. France at that time had no definite claim on the Upper Niger below Segou, which is 1,000 miles above Say, nor had her sphere of influence on the Dahomey coast been carried further north than the ninth parallel. Her conquest of Dahomey had not at that time taken place, and her establishment on the coast was confined to Porto Novo and some trading posts.

An attempt to visit Timbuctoo was made in 1889 by the naval Lieutenant Caron, who descended the river from Bamaku in an armed steam launch. After a perilous voyage, he succeeded in reaching the port of Timbuctoo, but the attitude of the natives was so threatening that he was compelled to return up stream without even landing there. Nevertheless, it is probable that France will, before long, occupy Timbuctoo, not because of its intrinsic importance—for this, according to the best authorities, is small—but because its name is a household word, redolent of the poetry of the desert and of the mingled civilisation and barbarism of Islam in Africa, which appeals to the imagination of the French electorate.

From Tufilaten down to a little above Say, the Niger is so broken by rocks and rapids as to make its navigation impracticable to cargo vessels; while the country on either side for the greater part of the distance is rocky and sterile.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': 'Whatever the variety of theories and methods of colonial domination suggested and implemented in the period between the two world wars, an emergent pattern of bureaucratic rule is evident. By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North Africa and the Sahara', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Here two points must be made.

Barely ten years after the event, for example, a son might give details of his father's battles which the latter knew nothing about, though, from then on, he would knit them into his account in all good faith. The colonial version, though contemporaneous with the events, is not perfect; it is tainted with the hostility that existed in the armies of the colonial powers between metropolitan and colonial regiments. The officers of the latter did not hesitate to portray their campaigns in Africa in such a way as to make them look comparable to the battles waged in Europe by the former. 5\nThe second influence was nationalist. Operations for conquest were contemporaneous with reformist and nationalist activity in the towns. Even when they were taking place far from the towns, the townspeople eagerly followed their ups and downs and immediately used them for ideological ends. It was often the militant townsman who got the old highland warrior to dictate his recollections.\nFor the two reasons given, the statements we now have cannot transform the colonial account or the nationalist version: but they can throw a different light on them, always provided we go beyond their strictly local setting."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in North Africa and the Sahara', 'section_title': 'Stages of resistance > The failure of African initiatives and resistance', 'content': ""and Islam lays down strict rules for people's wars. Contrary to the idea common in the West, the djihâd as understood in recent centuries is defensive: that is, military service and the taxes that flow from it are only compulsory for everyone if the country is the victim of aggression. In the case of an offensive war (and there have been none in North Africa for centuries), contribu› tions and service are only voluntary. In the circumstances of the nineteenth century, this left the military initiative to the invader. Defence of the realm was traditionally one of the provisions of the bay'a (sovereign's investiture contract). In the event of attack, were Muslims supposed to organize resistance themselves immediately, or ought they to await the sultan's instructions? The question has been discussed at length by the doctors of law, and the view that prevailed was that responsibility should be left to the sovereign so as to stop demagogy and extravagant promises. This explains why, when French or Spanish soldiers appeared in a district, as they did in Tuât in 1864 and 1890 or Tarfaya in 1885, the inhabitants sent a delegation to the Sultan and then awaited his orders. Responsibility was thus left with the sovereign; and he was in a dilemma, for if he held aloof, he jeopardized the legitimacy of his authority, and if he replied favourably to the request, the powers would hold him responsible for anything that happened. Usually he advised calm, delegated a chief to maintain order, and allowed those involved to hope that the problem was being solved through diplomatic means (which many of those on the spot were all too ready to believe).$^{40}$ Here we come to the heart of the matter.

The instructions to Sir Charles Warren are as follows: ""The general object of your mission is to remove the filibusters from Bechuanaland, to restore order in the territory, to reinstate the natives on their lands, to take such measures as may be necessary to prevent further depredation; and, finally, to hold the country until its further destination is known. You have also correctly defined the outlines of the policy to be adhered to, and your own duties as Special Commissioner. You will be under the direction of Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of the Cape Colony and Her Majesty\'s High Commissioner in South Africa, who will, however, be requested to leave you a very large discretion as regards all local matters. In regard to all operations in the field and the organization of the mounted Volunteer Force, you will receive your instructions from the Secretary of State for War, and the General Commanding in South Africa, and will not be accountable to the Colonial Government or to the High Commissioner. Should you require assistance in the discharge of your civil and political duties, which cannot be rendered by the military officers on your staff, you should apply to the High Commissioner to sanction any necessary payments from the fund at his disposal for the purposes of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. You will clearly understand that Her Majesty\'s Government have agreed that the Cape Ministers shall endeavour to effect a peaceful settlement of the difficulties in Montsioa\'s country, and that active military operations shall not be commenced until a reasonable time has elapsed. Her Majesty\'s Government sincerely trust that the Cape Government may be able to propose such a settlement as can be honourably accepted, but it is obvious that in the unfortunate event of their failure to do so no time should be lost in removing from the Protectorate those who have violated its independence and seized the lands of the protected chief. The Cape Government have stated that (if their mission be successful) they think they will be in a position to submit to the Colonial Parliament, as soon as it meets, a scheme for the government of the country, pending its annexation to the colony. Should their expectation be fulfilled, it will become a question for the consideration of Sir H. Robinson, after consultation with you, whether you should continue in charge of the Protectorate until the necessary measures for taking it over have been adopted by the Cape Parliament. If, on the other hand, the annexation of the territory to the colony should for the present prove impracticable, it will be necessary to maintain within it a sufficient armed police force; and if it is necessary to increase the force now in Bechuanaland, suitable men for the purpose will doubtless be procurable from among the mounted Volunteers whom you are about to enrol.

Since March 31 last the remainder of the capital has been entirely called up. In a separate report the directors have detailed the Company's operations since the grant of the Royal Charter, and have added many items of information which will prove interesting to shareholders, and enable them to realise the work effected in opening up and developing the field of the Company's operations.\n\nArrangements have been made for the construction of the section, from Vryburg to Mafeking, of the northward extension of the Colonial Railway. The construction of this railway will entitle the Company to 8,000 square miles of land in British Bechuanaland, over one-third of the area of the entire colony. The telegraph was completed to Fort Salisbury on Feb. 17, 1892, thus covering a total distance from Mafeking of 819 miles, chiefly over very rough country. The cost of the line was £92,809. Up to August 31 last, messages representing 1,562,112 words had been transmitted over the line, which, after making allowance for Government messages, gave a net revenue of upwards of £4,000, equal to over 4 per cent. on the capital invested. Since August the Company has entered the Postal Union of South Africa, and a weekly service for passengers and mails has been established throughout Mashonaland. Letters and parcels can now be despatched from any town or station in Mashonaland to all parts of the world.

At Lagos the Admiralty has hitherto supplied the service of two gun-boats, which have been employed in the navigation of the lagoons, and in communicating with vessels outside the entrance.\n\nFrom the shallowness of the water of the lagoons it is necessary that the vessel employed in their navigation should have a very light draft of water, whilst, for going outside, the heavy sea that prevails on the bar necessitates the employment of a larger and deeper steamer.\n\nAlthough two vessels are thus required for the use of the settlement, it would be quite possible to dispense with the services of the larger, except at particular periods; for example, when the arrival of the mail, men-of-war, or store-ships, &c., was expected; but during these intervals she might proceed to the Gold Coast, and afford the Governor of that settlement an opportunity of visiting some of his numerous out-stations. As the distance between the two colonies is but three hundred miles, there would be plenty of time to allow of her performing this service at frequent intervals, without prejudice to her ordinary duties at Lagos.\n\nIt appears from the army estimates for the present year that the proposed military expenditure on the four settlements amounts to £27,897, and that this provides for an effective force of two regiments of black troops, or about 1,800 men.\n\nIt has been already stated that the condition of affairs on the Gold Coast and Lagos is such as to warrant the reduction of the force allotted for their occupation one-half, or by half a regiment; this should effect a corresponding diminution of one-fourth in the amount of the estimate, but so much of this expenditure is caused by the large establishment of staff, which the exigencies of the climate appear to render necessary, that it will not effect anything like this saving.\n\nThe force formerly employed on the coast averaged about 1,000 men, and there seems no reason to suppose that it might not be at once reduced to this amount without exposing the settlements to any risk; further reductions are, however, needed to bring the charge for their defence within reasonable limits, and the readiest mode of effecting this is to be found in the extension to the other settlements, so far as their circumstances warrant, of the system already successfully tried at Lagos, the employment of an armed police force of the natives known as houssas, as auxiliaries to, or even substitutes for, regular soldiers.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Capture of Tambi', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Instructions were recently received at Sierra Leone from the home authorities to despatch a military expedition to Tambi to chastise Chief Karimo.

Colonel Ellis, in the meantime, had been sent for from the Gambia River. He arrived at Sierra Leone on the 28th in her Majesty's gun-boat Widgeon, and left with the last detachment in command of the whole expedition. What is being done now ought to have been done in the first instance. A Frontier Police may be useful where no troops are stationed, but people fail to see the value of the police force, when the troops can be called upon, and are always available to fight when and where necessary.\n\nA detachment of the West India Regiment and of the Sierra Leone Frontier Police, portions of the second Expedition despatched against Tambi, returned to Freetown on April 13, with the intelligence that the attack on Karimo's stronghold had been completely successful.\n\nImmediately after the reverse of March 18, when Captain Robinson, of the Royal Engineers, was killed, the Acting-Governor, Sir William Jones, received authority to employ the West India Regiment, if necessary, in support of the further expedition that was now inevitable. He left Freetown, on the 20th, with an escort of fifty police, to visit the friendly natives, and ascertain whether they would be willing to furnish levies, and proceed against Karimo in company with the Sierra Leone Frontier Force. The mission was successful, and the levies were of the utmost value.\n\nThe Expedition, consisting of eighteen officers and 550 men of the West India Regiment and a body of the Frontier Police, started for Tambi on the 30th ultimo, under the command of Colonel Alfred Ellis. The force was joined by the native levies, and the combined Expedition appeared before Tambi a few days later.\n\nNo time was lost in beginning the attack. The native friendlies were at once sent forward to surround the stockade and destroy the outworks, instructions which they carried out with promptitude, after a few skirmishes with the enemy, in which several casualties occurred on both sides. The troops and the police were then ordered to the front, and after some sharp fighting, in which two soldiers were wounded severely and eight slightly, the town was carried by assault.\n\nNo prisoners were taken, as Karimo's forces evacuated the stronghold before the Expedition was able to cut them off. Their rout was complete, and during the two and a-half hours for which the fighting lasted their losses must have been considerable. Karimo himself, whose capture is so necessary to the peace and security of the district, was not in Tambi during the assault.

The scene of the conflict is to the west of Lake Nyassa, in the country known as Angoniland, within the British Central African Protectorate; and a confederacy of slave-dealing chiefs seems to have been formed, with King Mwasigungu at its head, whose object was to dispute the right of the British to interfere with their man-hunting expeditions. Nobody can impute a shadow of bloodguiltiness in this matter to our representatives. Every effort appears to have been made by our Consul-General to come to terms with the barbarous potentate; but Mwasigungu rejected all offers, and actually declared war. No doubt he felt confident of beating the small force of Sikhs and Natives, who could be brought against him, and, as far as numerical superiority went, his confidence was not misplaced. In the actual conflict, Lieut. Alston and Captain Stewart, who commanded the Sikh contingent, had only 150 men under them, to which must be added a body of five thousand Natives. This little army marched into the country of the slave-dealers, and in three battles succeeded in utterly routing King Mwasigungu and the other chiefs, although they had a force of twenty thousand fighters. The danger of the enterprise can be gauged from the fact that two strong stockades had to be taken by assault, and Lieut. Alston is mentioned as having gallantly led the storming parties. Fifty towns were captured by the victorious British troops, and 600 prisoners, including 14 chiefs, fell into their hands. One of the latter, a notorious character, with the stain of past murders on his soul, was taken to the shores of Lake Nyassa, and there tried, condemned, and executed. The loss in the slavedealers\' army was great, while six of the Sikhs seem to have fallen on our side. The capture of ninety guns, and the re-opening of the trade routes to the Luapula river, are not the greatest advantages to be derived from this achievement. The prestige of the Arab slave-dealers will have received a blow in all the region between the Portuguese border and the Loangwa; while the ability of the British to make their Protectorate a reality will be forcibly impressed on the Native mind. Not only has the capital of the presumptuous monarch been captured, but a fort has been built there and garrisoned by Protectorate troops, so that there will be a standing pledge and symbol of our authority in the heart of the country. Thus gradually the tide of civilisation sweeps over the darkest places of the Dark Continent, and not for the first or the last time has British daring and enterprise brought succour to the slave. If the process of ""ransoming the African"" has to be effected by violent means, then it is satisfactory to find that a force under the British flag is capable of meeting four times its number of Arabs, and putting them to rout.

Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious.

There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place. However, policy ran a long gamut, from reluctant acceptance and forced adaptation of such structures as in Portuguese Angola and German East Africa, to considered efforts at institutional preservation as in British Northern Nigeria or French Morocco. Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'What was the attitude of the Africans themselves to the establishment of colonialism, involving as it did such a fundamental change in the nature of the relationships that had existed between them and the Europeans over the preceding three hundred years? This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

The colonial governments made varied use, as R. F. Betts has shown above (Chapter 13) of traditional institutions and leadership elites to facilitate their control of the subject peoples. Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools. Having lost the traditionality of their positions and roles in the eyes of their people, they were treated in most cases like mere instruments of control by the colonial masters and not as real partners. The loss of real power and social status and prestige was a source of discontent for many of them."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years. The importance of this particular legacy varied from one colonial system to the other. There is no doubt that the British bequeathed a better trained, numerically larger and more experienced bureaucracy to her colonies than the French, while the record of the Belgians and the Portuguese is the worst in this respect.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'And as will be seen in many of the following chapters, religion was indeed one of the weapons used against colonialism. Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

A most intelligent and trustworthy correspondent lately gave us, apropos of a desired tramway, some account of the rapid progress of palm-oil tree plantations in the Eastern district. All this, and a great deal more, seems, however, to be threatened, through that long indecision, that long delay in arriving at a wise decision, on the part of Earl Kimberley, of which we have ventured to complain. The existing danger is not a danger arising from any present military superiority of the Ashantis over the people of the Protected Territories. Under the, for a long time, efficacious protection of Great Britain, the population of those territories has so greatly increased since the time of the old Ashanti triumphs above alluded to, that we do not hesitate to say they are fully capable of their own protection and defence against Ashanti, if permitted to organize and act in their own way, and furnished with those supplies of arms and ammunition and other sinews of war, which it is the indisputable duty of the British Government, as the sole recipients of the customs revenues (the only revenues) to place at their disposal. And here the complete organization for defence against Ashanti, as projected and arranged by the Fanti Confederation, comes naturally before us once again for recommendation and insistence with Her Majesty's Government. Under actual British West African policy, as inaugurated after the decision of the House of Commons' Committee in 1865, such confederation, whether for eventual good (as we believe) or eventual evil, has become an absolute necessity of the position. This is no new assertion of ours. We have insisted on it again and again, no doubt to the disgust of the Colonial office. But it is the fault of Earl Kimberley, not our fault, that we are compelled again to reproduce the leading facts in our columns. After the ill-blown and disastrous Ashanti war bubble, which led to the sitting of the aforesaid Parliamentary Committee, the people of the Protected Territories were informed by the British authorities that in the future they must depend entirely on themselves as against Ashanti. Some arms and ammunition might be served out to them, and a British officer or two be lent to them - but nothing more. From that time the Home Government set resolutely to work to reduce the military expenditure on the West Coast. What remains for now some time past at Cape Coast and Accra, is nothing more than a mere guard for the sacred persons of the British authorities, and for the British flag which floats there. While thus, however, repudiating all obligation to defend, and withdrawing all their means for defending, they kept and keep within their own hand all power to direct the policy and negotiations of the territories as regards Ashanti; and as regarded the habitual allies of the Ashantis, the Dutch; as well as the whole public revenue of the country. Hence the treaty with Holland for exchange of territories, which, most unwisely, handed over towns to the Dutch without the consent of the people; and whole provinces which we had no power whatever to give, much less any shadow of right to give; and which opened to the traditional Ashanti enemy constant access to Elmina and other then Dutch coast towns. The kings, chiefs, and people saw the injustice and the danger, and met it boldly. Combined native forces assembled for operations against the Dutch. These operations led eventually to the sale by the Dutch of all their Gold Coast possessions to Great Britain. The assemblage of those combined native forces had in it the fruitful and vigorous germ of the Fanti Confederation, which became an acknowledged and influential fact during their progress. We have before claimed, and we claim again, for that Confederation the great victory of the entire withdrawal of the Dutch from the West Coast. Meanwhile the Ashantis—as the fruit of what ought to have been nipped in the bud at Addah by the British authorities at Cape Coast if they had been worth their salt as rulers—had laid waste whole districts in the extreme east of the territories, destroyed the cotton plantations and the people of Krepee, and committed all those other horrible excesses which uniformly attend their invasions. Was it likely, was it reasonable, that the kings and chiefs, alive to their constant peril on the side of Ashanti—long since forewarned that they must provide for their own defence; and seeing the Coast quite denuded (so far as regards all practical purposes connected with internal policy) of British troops—should dissolve their infant but provedly effective union, which had only been effected at the price of many mutual concessions; fold their arms in apathetic resignation, and deliver their throats to the Ashanti knife? It was neither likely, nor reasonable. What was likely and reasonable was, that they should endeavour to cement and extend their union; that they should organize it for internal administration and defence, under the friendly care of the British Government. They did this. The British authorities had often shown them that, before they could be regarded as a real organization, they must form something of a constitution, setting forth their objects, aims, and proposed means of action. This they did also. They met at Mankessim, joined and assisted by educated natives. They drafted and signed a Constitution, appointed officers, sent some of these latter, with the said Constitution, to be submitted to the British Coast authorities and the Colonial authorities at home, for their examination and approval. Then burst the storm. The Acting Administrator, Mr. Salmon, received the Fanti Confederation officials with a burst of ungovernable fury; refused to take and transmit the documents, charged the bearing officials with high treason, arrested and imprisoned them. He made the British Government to be like the dog in the manger—unable and unwilling to govern and defend the interior provinces, but at the same time determined that the Fanti Confederation, which could, and offered to do this, should not do it either. We do not intend here to re-state the persecutions and prosecutions which resulted from this dog-in-the-manger policy of an Administrator who was clearly unfit for the office he then filled, under circumstances that demanded a wise and prudent course of conduct. Immediately the atrocious folly came to our knowledge, we supplied Earl Kimberley with a copy of the Fanti Constitution, and detail of what had taken place, referring the whole matter to his consideration, and praying a speedy decision. Hitherto no such decision has been communicated. The territories remain without any effective native organization for their defence. The kings of some of the frontier provinces have therefore acted according to their own will. Hence the detention by them of the Ashanti chieftain, whose cruelties at Elmina and elsewhere had made him very odious to them; and, as a further consequence, the reported Ashanti inroad, with its usual atrocities and horrors. Both these are the direct results of the non-adoption of the Fanti Confederation by Earl Kimberley; while he has been at the same time carrying out the economic Government policy of the withdrawal of troops from the Coast. Had the Fanti Confederation been thus adopted, and its organization and action been approved and regulated by the British Government, the Confederation would have acted in accord with the British authorities as to the return of the Ashanti captain to his country. He would not have been detained as he has been, to the disgrace of the British authorities and the anger of the King of Ashanti. Nor this alone; but in addition, it is beyond doubt that the King of Ashanti would never have ventured an inroad into the Fanti countries had their organization for defence been approved and perfected. The so-called Protected Territories could only be a prey for the Ashantis when there existed division among their kings and chiefs, or some mere temporary rope of sand their union, ready to fall in pieces at the Ashanti touch. United, as they have sought to unite themselves, for general policy and combined action, with the assent of the British Government, they would be a power with which Ashanti could not cope. Unless the British Government has entirely changed its policy, and intends to undertake the military defence of the Protected Territories and their permanent internal administration, in defiance of the Parliamentary recommendation, it is imperatively called upon, by"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_01_1873#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EXTENSION OF BRITISH PROTECTORATE ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""In a letter from the Colonial Office to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, with reference to complaints of interference with trade with West Africa, and apathy and inactivity on the part of the Government of our West African possessions, Sir Henry Holland says steps have been taken to stop the attacks of the Adansis on native traders on their way to the coast, and an officer had been despatched to warn the chiefs and people against committing or allowing such outrages. With reference to the memorial from the mercantile community of the Gold Coast, urging the need of keeping open the trade routes to the interior, with particular reference to the action of the people of Sefwhi, Her Majesty's Government have consented that the Sefwhi country should, on certain conditions, be included in the British Protectorate on the Gold Coast. Captain Lonsdale has been sent up to Sefwhi to arrange with the King and people for their being taken under British protection. The condition will, of course, be imposed that they should refrain from interfering with traders, and give free and unrestricted intercourse through their country. With reference to the complaints of delay on the part of the Governor in replying to the despatch from Colonel Stanley as to the condition of Coomassie, Sir H. Holland says that Colonel Stanley approved of the postponement of the despatch of an officer to Coomassie. There might be a large staff of officials in the Colony, but the Governor might not have at his disposal a suitable man for such a mission. To appoint an officer not possessing the necessary qualifications would be to risk a serious failure, and an aggravation of the evils it was desired to remove. Sir Henry Holland is most anxious that trade in the West African colonies should be fostered and developed, nor can he doubt that the Governors of those colonies share his anxiety to promote that object. He must express his dissent from the opinion of the Chamber that there has been apathy on the part of the Gold Coast Government in dealing with these matters. The task of maintaining peace and order in the interior, and securing freedom of trade, necessitates tedious and troublesome negotiations, which, owing to the jealousies and differences amongst the various tribes, require to be conducted with much tact and delicacy.

We are lords of the coast from the Assinee to the Volta,* with exception of a few isolated points so feebly held by the Dutch, that, but for British assistance, the latter would have been driven out long since by the natives. Along that coast we have certain fortified places and other towns. But we have never professed to acquire territory beyond the immediate precincts of those fortified places. All without those narrow lines is native—under British protection from the Assinee to and beyond the Volta, and from the coast to the frontiers of Ashantee. The natives have accepted our protection, as successors to the old African Company, because it is only our shadow over them that has prevented their being swallowed up by the Ashantees, whom that company first enabled them successfully to resist. But for that shadow, the chiefs would have been at perpetual war one with the other; the foreign slave-trade would have gone on depopulating, and the Ashantees would have found them an easy prey.

The truth is they have no commanders. Their kings, chiefs, and captains are such in name only—not a soul cares for any one of them. Now just look at King Cudjoe of Accra. He is at this moment on the Volta at the head of his _Army_, which, without any exaggeration, consists of himself and the little boy that carries his stool or throne! There are three or four other _Kings_ of the protectorate there in the same plight—five kings whose combined forces consist of eleven men including themselves. The coast natives do not care a fig for their chiefs. This is not to be wondered at; what is surprising is that the Government does not assume the authority which these chiefs once did possess, but which is now exercised by nobody. King Cudjoe is a very respectable chief, quite a different stamp of man from the ordinary coast chiefs, and not a drunken old sot as he has been described in my hearing by certain ""gentlemen,"" who are really hardly ever sober themselves.

The exclusive intelligence to be found in our columns will well repay perusal. We fear there is no doubt of an Ashantee war. Imperfect as our system (if it merit the name of a system) on the Gold Coast is, the comparative security of life there has long been gradually draining Ashantee of a portion of its population. Slaves seek refuge there, rather than be slaughtered and buried in a dead chief's grave. Is any chief or headman summoned to Comassie in a manner that causes him to dread a fatal termination to his journey, he prefers to migrate to the protected territories with his willing followers. If the British Government had fully comprehended its inevitable mission on the Gold Coast, the active influences of civilization would long ere this have penetrated Ashantee, and such a war as is now imminent, or actually commenced, would have been impossible. Had there been roads from the coast to the Ashantee frontier, every police post at their terminus would have been a radiating centre of civilising influences. We think that on the first symptoms of approaching trouble with Ashantee, the Gold Coast authorities ought to have called upon the chiefs to open up military paths, if not roads, through their districts. Now we suppose every man is engaged as a soldier. The people have to defend their homes. But when this war shall have finished, roads must be made, and such changes as may be requisite in the character of our occupation there in order to enable this to be effected must be ordered. A wave of civilization must have way made for it to roll on from the seacoast to the Kong Mountains. We are sorry not to have heard of any proclamation forbidding the Fantees and other people of the protected territories to slaughter and decapitate their prisoners. It is not creditable to us that it should be thought pleasant to our authorities on the coast to have human heads sent to them. We are in Africa to civilise, and to countenance barbarous practices is not the way to civilise. Again, if the quarrel proceed to full and widespread hostilities, we hope the small British force there will be under good leadership. We confess to great misgivings on this point. The state of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps does not inspire us with any confidence in those who have allowed that formerly fine, well-behaved body of men to lose all discipline and subordination.

It indicates that Her Majesty's Government have entirely abandoned the do-nothing or surrender policy which was so disgraceful to Great Britain, and so unjust and destructive to the protected territories; that they feel and admit their obligations as regards those territories, and are determined to vindicate British honour and Gold Coast security, against the cruel and treacherous enemy who has been so disgracefully permitted to push his devastating hordes to within cannon-shot of Cape Coast and Elmina. Sir Garnet Wolseley has a reputation for dash, daring and persistence, which induces us to think him a fit person to be at the helm of affairs on the Gold Coast at this period, when the evils which have flooded in, because of Colonel Harley's fatal incapacity, demand the presence of a man of action for their removal. It must not, however, be supposed that in condemning Colonel Harley we exonerate Her Majesty's Government. They appointed him, and they sustained him against an overwhelming evidence of events which convinced every one but themselves; and now they will have to draw largely on Imperial revenues to undo the mischief which their protégé has permitted to run riot in the countries placed under his care. We look upon this, however, only as a just retribution. The British Government would not do anything for those countries which Divine Providence had given into their hands. They withdrew their troops, yet would not allow the natives to confederate and organize for the defence of the countries which they stated they would themselves no longer defend. They would not surrender for the organization of a local force, any portion of the large revenues they were levying on the trade of the country. They ignored the wealth and importance of territories, second to none in the world if the ordinary appliances of civilization had been introduced there. And now, through the acts of their own servants, without any fault on the part of the unfortunate natives, they have been placed in a position with regard to those territories which exacts from them, in vindication of their national honour, pecuniary and other sacrifices tenfold greater than would have been needed for the performance of the duties they have sinfully neglected. We say sinfully, for God does not entrust power to such a country as Great Britain to be used by her as the talent was by the man mentioned in one of the parables of our Divine Redeemer. She has neglected her duty; and now God, by His overruling of human actions and events, forces her to perform it in the very way she would least of all have desired.

In virtue of those powers we made every chief or king answerable to us for the way in which he exercised his powers and as regards disputes with neighbouring chiefs, because to make the Protectorate strong it was necessary the tribes should be at peace one with another; and because, being involved through the Protectorate we had assumed in any disputes they might have with their formidable neighbours, it was but just we should have the power to restrain them from any acts that should lead to hostilities. These mutual relations and duties were not questioned on either side. The last Asánte war, however, led to results which have changed all this. After the withdrawal of the West India troops from the River Prah, the native kings and chiefs were distinctly informed that in future they were to protect themselves—that all they could count upon from the British authorities was some arms and ammunition, and possibly an officer or two to direct them.

This approach was criticized by white settlers who desired more direct control over African labor, and the importation of Indian laborers for the sugar industry further indicates a reliance on external rather than local native forces for economic purposes. The African Times articles mention a volunteer force in Natal composed of nearly 500 enrolled Europeans, indicating some local mobilization for military purposes, but not involving native forces. They also highlight the use of native police in other regions, such as Sulymah, suggesting some integration of local forces in British operations, though not predominantly in Natal. The lack of specific examples of native forces being mobilized for military campaigns in Natal in the articles suggests that the claim may not fully align with the historical context presented, indicating a difference in the portrayal of British colonial strategy in Natal.

They were also without diplomatic and military alliances with their neighbours. Instead, they frequently raided, fought and generally distrusted each other. Their compositions ranged from autonomous chieftaincies to bands of nomadic refugees, captive slaves, and wards of either the colonialists or missionaries. Most were tributaries or raid victims of the Zulu, Ndebele, Bemba, Yao or Nguni.\nWhile some of these small groups, like the Barwe, Mangwende, Makoni and Mutasa paramountcies, chose armed resistance against the threat of colonialism as did the Xhosa, many others such as the Hlubi, Mpondomise, Bhaca, Senga and Njanja allied themselves with the whites in the misguided hope of thereby assuring their protection and security.

The Shona, Tonga, Tawara, Venda and Ndau had frequently employed these strategies throughout the eighteenth and nine› teenth centuries, during the rivalry between the Changamire and Mwenemutapa dynasties, while the Sotho, Mpondo, Mfengu, Thembu and Tonga had utilized similar strategies to exploit the rivalry between the Mtetwa and Ndwande confederacies.

Added to this, several of the small groups, such as the Mfengu, Thembu, Njanja, Cewa and Tawara, had for some time existed under strong military influence.

Most likely the missionaries had left on the advice of Shepstone, who knew of the impending war, just as he had done in 1877. 47 On 11 December 1878 the full ultimatum was delivered to the Zulu representatives. It demanded the dismantling of the Zulu army, acceptance of a British resident, reinstatement of all the missionaries, and payment of fines from the various alleged violations of the Natal border and persons. 48 The ultimatum was simply impossible to meet within the specified twenty to thirty days. When the time expired, the British forces under LieutenantGeneral Lord Chelmsford invaded the Zulu kingdom on 10 January 1879.\nChelmsford's army consisted of 15000 soldiers, many of whom were Africans drafted in Natal, while Cetshwayo's force probably numbered 45000. The major advantage enjoyed by the British was their firearms, which were most effective when used in combination with such defensive measures as trenches, walls of waggons or sandbags. The Zulu, on the other hand, fought with spears and shields and had a limited number of guns which they had not yet integrated fully into their military technology and training. The shields were useless against bullets. The spears were devastatingly lethal in close combat, but the Zulu were not allowed to profit from this advantage by the British army, which fired at them from a long distance. The result was that in nearly all the battles the Zulu suffered enormous casualties while striving to get near their enemies. It was only at Isandhlwana on 22 January 1879 that the Zulu tackled a British column in the open and thoroughly beat it.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure.

While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

All the Africans living in the reserves were placed under chiefs and headmen, and where the latter did not exist, new ones were created. African laws, except those concerning witchcraft, were permitted to operate. To finance his administration, Shepstone imposed a hut tax collectable in cash or cattle (which could be sold to the white farmers for cash). His administration was consistently attacked by the white settlers because, they argued, it made the Africans economically self-sufficient and therefore prevented them from becoming labourers on the farms and plantations. But Shepstone did not lock up the Africans in locations because he loved them. Rather, he clearly saw that coercive measures to produce labourers would only result in resistance, which the comparatively weak Natal colonial administration could not possibly cope with. The settlers who criticized him seem to have ignored the contribution of Africans to the profits of large landowners who subsisted on the rentals of over half the black population living as squatters on white farms, and to the colony's revenues in the form of the hut tax. In fact what Shepstone had done was to produce a cheap administration that afforded the white colonial society opportunities to exploit both the Africans and their natural resources in comparative peace and security. 12 The white society was mostly of British origin. After the drain by Boer emigration the white population increased steadily as a result of immigration by British subjects escaping from the social problems accompanying the economic crisis of 1847-51. Financed by speculators, some 5000 white settlers left Britain for Natal in this period. By 1870 the whites in Natal numbered 18000. The increase in the number of white settlers went hand in hand with constitutional changes. In 1856 Natal was made a separate colony and granted a Legislative Council. The franchise was made colour-blind, so that male British subjects owning at the minimum immovable property worth £50 or renting property worth £50 at an annual rate of £10 could vote. But the whites made it impossible for the Africans to qualify for the vote.

The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected.

The Boers obtained self-government, which indeed proved to be a stepping stone to greater freedom. Further negotiations produced the London Convention of 27 February 1884 under which Britain relinquished its control over the Africans, but retained control of the republic's foreign relations.51\nJust as the imperial forces were struggling to crush the Boer uprising, the Cape colonial forces were fighting the Sotho in a war that broke out on 13 September 1880. Just like the first Anglo-Boer War, the Lesotho armed conflict was intimately related to the British efforts to achieve a South African confederation. Both the Cape colonial government and the British officials at the Cape wanted to disarm the African states as a first step to federation. And it was the Sotho rejection of unilateral disarmament that led to the Cape-Sotho War of 1880-1.\nSince 1872 Lesotho had come under the Cape colonial administration.

Terms such as 'treaty', 'sphere of influence', 'effective occupation', 'annexation' and 'frontier force', which became common throughout the rest of Africa after the Berlin Conference, had been in widespread use in Southern Africa since 1815. European settlers in Southern Africa, unlike their counterparts in the rest of Africa, were from the beginning interested in establishing permanent homes in their new environment, attracted by its temperate climate, fertile agricultural land, cheap African labour and an abundance of minerals.\nBy 1880 there were a total of four white polities in South Africa: the Cape Colony and Natal, with their predominantly English-speaking white population of 185000 and 20000 respectively, and the South African Republic and Orange Free State, each with over 50000 Dutch-speaking whites. Then, on 12 September 1890, a further British colony, Mashonaland, was established. In these five settler colonies, vast majorities of indigenous Africans were dominated by white minorities. For the San and Khoikhoi this domination had been going on for over two hundred years while others, such as the Xhosa, Mfengu, Thembu and Mpondo peoples, had been subjugated to varying forms of colonial rule for nearly a century (see Fig. 9.1). 1\nUnder the Sand River Convention (1852), the British and Afrikaners had agreed not to sell firearms to Africans throughout Southern Africa.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite.

By then the kingdom was under Mswati. The society consisted of a dominant immigrant Nguni group to which the royal Nkosi-Dlamini dynasty belonged, and the indigenous Sotho people. The Nguni had established their rule over the Sotho by conquest and marriage alliance and had created a centralized, unified kingdom based on common loyalty to the crown, on friendships and intermarriages. Like the southern Sotho and the Tswana, they had survived the ravages of the Zulu revolution, but were occasionally victims of Zulu raids. Their foreign policy was designed to secure defensive alliance against the Zulu. Thus initially Mswati regarded the settlers of Natal and the Transvaal as well as the British government as potential allies against his traditional African enemies. 10 The settlers, on the other hand, were interested only in the land, live› stock, labour and minerals of the Swazi. The Transvaal was particularly interested in the annexation of Swaziland in order to gain access to the sea through Kosi Bay. At the same time, Natal and Britain were particularly afraid of a German-Transvaal partnership in promoting a railway to Kosi Bay. But neither of them was willing to assume direct responsibility over Swaziland, a small area that was isolated from the larger colonies and the lines of communications, and where no substantial mineral discoveries had been made.

The African rulers, like Moshoeshoe, sought to forestall settler colonial rule by acquiring pro› tectorate status. When alarmed by a dissident sect of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Transvaal - the Doppers - who wanted to cross through Tswana territories to Damaraland in 1876, Kgama, king of the Ngwato section of the Tswana, had written to the 'Great Queen of the English People' requesting protection. He wanted to know the conditions for protection and he emphasized that the relationship would be guided by 'Christian morality'. Furthermore, his rival brother, Kgamane, had settled in the Transvaal with his followers and was fighting with the Boers in the hope of gaining the Ngwato throne (see Fig. 9.1).\nThe British were bitterly divided over Bechuanaland. The RhodesRobinson group wanted to eliminate the imperial factor in favour of settler colonialism - including joint annexation by the Cape and the Transvaal, which only failed because the Transvaal refused. But the MackenzieWarren humanitarian-imperialist groups, like the African rulers, wanted to forestall settler colonialsim, because they were opposed to the brutality and destructiveness of settler colonialism over their Tswana Christian converts and church schools.

The Nandi in Kenya, for instance, resisted militarily the construc› tion of the railway through their territory. Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.654, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony and Natal before 1870', 'content': ""allowed literate Africans with some property to petition the lieutenant-governor to exempt them from African customary laws.

The lieutenant-governor again had the discretion to turn down such a petition. The result was that, up to 19035, only three Africans had qualified for the vote in Natal and Zululand. 13 Economically, Natal came to rely on the sugar industry, which required intensive use of human labour. Efforts to compel Africans to supply the necessary labour came to nothing, because of the poor working conditions and low wages offered by the planters. The Natal planters, assisted by their government, resorted to the importation of Indian labourers. The scheme was arranged in such a way that at the end of a ten-year period of working in Natal, the Indian labourer had the option of either returning to India with his passage paid or exchanging his passage fees for a land grant and remaining in Natal permanently. The first Indians arrived under that scheme in i860 and towards the end of the 1860s there were 6000 of them in Natal; many of these opted to remain in South Africa permanently.

These treaties were calculated to secure the area for the British rather than the French or the Germans who were encroaching from the west and east respectively.\nFollowing the establishment of the principle of effective occupation at the Berlin Conference and to forestall the French and the Germans, the RNC felt compelled to move in. The doors to the north lay through Ilorin and Nupe, both of which were determined to maintain their inde› pendence and sovereignty. Nupe was therefore invaded in 1897.

Nevertheless, the RNC came out victorious in the end, deposed the Etsu and installed a more pliable one. Nupe was defeated because, as Crowder has pointed out, it failed to realize that 'head-on cavalry charges against rapid-firing rifles, artillery and maxim guns was the worst military strategy possible'.$^{52}$ A similar invasion was launched against Ilorin in the same year.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society.

But if there are difficulties ahead, it is well that the country should be prepared for them in good time. From the detailed accounts we have lately received of the defeat of Usibepu, the loyal Zulu chief, whose power had been established on the ruins of Cetewayo\'s, it appears that the position of the Reserve and of the British Resident is seriously threatened. The conquerors of Usibepu included not only the Usutus, the tribesmen who had been unshaken in their allegiance to Cetewayo, but a powerful body of Boers from the Transvaal. To the latter, it is said, was due the success of the attack on Usibepu\'s warriors, who, having repulsed the onslaught of their native enemies, were broken by the withering fire of the Dutch riflemen. The flight of Usibepu leaves the ground clear for the ambition of the Boer leaders, and brings the Usutus, intoxicated by victory, face to face with the British forces within the Reserve. It is evident that the former adherents of Cetewayo are, for the moment, merely tools of the adventurers from the Transvaal, who imagine that there is something to be gained by stirring up turmoil among the Zulus. The experiment is, perhaps, not as hopeful as its authors believe, for the Zulus, as South African history shows, are not tools that can always be handled with safety and success by the Boers. In order, however, to rid themselves of Usibepu, and to give a check to the British power, the Usutus are willing to become the close allies of the Transvaal Republic, or, at all events, of its more reckless and aggressive spirits. Dinizulu, the youthful son of Cetewayo, has been set up as a puppet sovereign by the Boers, who have promised him their protection and assistance, and to revive a forgotten treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with Cetewayo\'s father, Panda. The first-fruits of this confederacy are visible in the overthrow of Usibepu. The latter reckoned, apparently, upon English support, though without any well-defined claim, and the Boers will in all probability make use of his ""abandonment"" as a cogent argument addressed to the native mind in favour of the Dutch instead of the British connexion. The Boers, at the same time, if not possessed of much political knowledge, can hardly be ignorant of the serious aspects of an attack upon England, and having enough to occupy them immediately in the absorption of the territories of Usibepu and his adherents, they will hardly encourage their new allies to press their advantage so far as to threaten the Reserve. But the Usutus are savages, and, while ready enough to accept the assistance of the Boers in battle, they may not be equally willing to pay deference to the prudent counsels of their advisers. They have already declared, in menacing language, that they will not spare either the Reserve or Natal itself in their campaign of vengeance. Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, had been forced to retreat even before the recent victory of the Boers and Usutus over Usibepu, and has been standing for some time on the defensive. The Imperial forces in Natal and in the Reserve are, no doubt, strong enough to repel any partial and unorganized raid, but there is now, it is clear, a possibility, at least, of more serious perils, which is causing disquietude at Maritzburg and Durban.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1884#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Late Kafir Trouble in Natal', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**ATROCITIES IN NATAL.** — The British public (whose attention has been of late much directed to the Ashanti muddle) appear to be not generally aware that in another part of Africa proceedings have recently taken place which, if the facts be as stated in the partial accounts received, cannot be otherwise described than as a series of cruel and dastardly outrages, perpetrated on a host of women and children. Several months ago some Kafirs, attracted to the ""Diamond-fields"" by the rush thither of many persons from all parts of South Africa, took occasion to supply themselves with rifles at the diggings. This proceeding coming to the ears of the Natal authorities, who have (and properly enough) forbidden the natives to have in their possession unregistered or concealed arms, an order was forthwith issued that the offending Kafirs should at once register their rifles. It appears that there was either a delay or a refusal to act on this order, and measures were taken to enforce compliance. Three young colonists lost their lives in attempting to arrest the Kafirs. Hereupon a large party of soldiers and colonists set out in pursuit of the offending natives, who fled across the mountains, leaving their wives, children, and cattle behind. Failing in their attempt to seize the males, the colonists made a wholesale sweep of all the female relatives and property of the fugitives, and, it would seem, with little discrimination as to whether they were taking the families of the innocent or the guilty. Not content with stealing from 8,000 to 9,000 head of cattle, and large numbers of sheep, goats, and horses, the Colonial authorities kidnapped (according to successive Reuter\'s telegrams) fifteen hundred of the helpless Kafir women, the wives, sisters, and children of the fugitives and others. And now comes the worst part of this disgraceful business. It is stated in the latest despatches that the wretched creatures thus torn away by wholesale from their homes, are to be ""distributed,"" and ""apprenticed out at a distance from their former homes."" ""Applications have been received for 5,000 of them, if procurable, from persons willing to employ them."" Now what does this mean? All who are acquainted with the relations of colonists and natives (especially as illustrated by the brutalities of the Queensland colonists towards their enslaved and kidnapped Polynesian islanders—slaves under the guise of ""apprenticeship"") will know well that this apportionment of Kafir women and children must naturally result in the grossest cruelties and abuses. These and other evils and crimes have as yet passed without protest from the mother country; especially as the immediate danger of a Kafir war has passed away. But the scandal is so serious—the disgrace, which such proceedings are calculated to cast on the British name, one of so dark a dye, that it is needful that the Parliament and people of Great Britain should insist upon full inquiry, and if these facts be established, emphatically express their abhorrence of such enormities, perpetrated by men assuming the name and character of Englishmen in Natal.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Terrible Slaughter of Natives on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From Freetown, under date December 30, we learn that an encounter took place recently, just outside the Sulymah district, between a small British force and a party of war-boys.

Odete made a determined resistance, but was eventually driven out, and the town was entered and taken, Captain Manning having only two men wounded.

Some weeks ago a party of his men made a raid close to Fort Mangoche, and carried off some Native women, the wives of some of the garrison. One of these women eventually returned. Her story was that, as soon as they were seized, they were hurried along through the bush to Katuri. On the second day she became exhausted and fell down, and was then beaten by her captors. At length the men left her lying insensible by the road. Telling her that she should not keep her baby, then only a few days old, they dashed its head against a rock and killed it. She eventually got back to Fort Mangoche. It was decided to send an expedition against Katuri, under the command of Lieut. Alston.\n\nLieut. Alston left for Mangoche on Sept. 15, with a force of 60 regulars, 30 irregular troops, and 20 carriers. They reached Katuri's town after a difficult journey through uninhabited country, without news of their advent having been communicated to Katuri himself. Katuri's town was a very large one, of about 30,000 houses, dotted over eight big hills and intervening valleys. The plains also for some distance in every direction were covered with houses. Lieut. Alston estimated the population at about 50,000. It had been arranged that the attack should be made in the early morning and, after a night march, the force arrived at the outskirts of the town before daylight. After a short engagement the town was captured, and Katuri himself was taken prisoner. The attack was so sudden that Katuri's men had no time to organise a defence, otherwise it would have been a very difficult place to capture. Most of the men fled when the first attack was made. The only casualties on the British side were two men wounded. A number of guns were seized, together with cattle and goats, and the whole place was burnt to the ground. Before Lieut. Alston returned to Fort Mangoche large numbers of people came in and stated their desire to leave Katuri and settle under the British at Fort Mangoche.\n\nBefore Lieut. Alston started on his return journey, 187 women, captured by Katuri in previous raids, succeeded in reaching him, and begged to be returned to their homes.

The Acting Commissioner at once despatched three columns to operate against the Natives. Fuller information from Blantyre, dated Oct. 25, informs us that a very serious attack had been made on the south-western portion of the British Central Africa Protectorate by the Angoni Zulus under Chikusi. The ruling chiefs of this tribe are related to the Matabele south of the Zambesi, and from time to time Matabele refugees have come to this district from across the Zambesi. By this means reports that the British were being worsted in the south by the Matabele spread to the Angoni, and Chikusi (whose territory lies partly within the British Protectorate and partly within the Portuguese sphere) seemed to think he could attack the British with some prospect of success. The slave raids of this chief were stopped a short time ago by the establishment of forts in the Upper Shire district, and as he thus lost much revenue by no longer being able to sell slaves to Arabs and Yaos he has of late been on very bad terms with the British. On Oct. 8, 600 of Chikusi’s warriors entered the Zambesi Industrial Mission station at Ntonda, on British territory, and, after demanding that the station and villages round should be ransomed they burnt villages and killed a number of people attached to the mission. On the same evening another band of 300 armed men occupied the mission station. Following on this, villages near Fort Liwonde on the Upper Shire were raided by Chikusi, and many people massacred.\n\nAs soon as the news reached Zamba, Mr. Sharpe, Acting Commissioner, took immediate measures for the defence of the protectorate. On Oct. 20 a column under Captain Stewart was despatched to the frontier, via Liwonde. Another force under Lieut. Alston, was sent via Fort Johnston, and Captain Manning and Sergeant-Major Devoy received orders to lead a third force of Sikhs from Central Angoniland. The three were to converge on Chikusi’s country. At the same time the Acting Commissioner sent information to the Portuguese at Tete asking them to co-operate with the British in dealing with such portions of Chikusi’s country as lay within their sphere. It was computed that Chikusi could put into the field 30,000 warriors, but only some 300 of these are armed with guns. In this case, however, it is not so much the guns that are dreaded as the rush of thousands of men armed with spears and knobkerries, and it is felt that the present enemy is only less formidable than the Arab confederation at the north end of Lake Nyassa was a year ago."", 'last_edit_date': '1897-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1897#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'NATAL.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By the Cape Mail we have news from Natal to the 3rd April. Previous reports are confirmed as regards the harvest prospects in this most interesting and important colony. Never, it is said, has there before been such a growing season. Never before did the crops look so green, advanced, and promising in March and April. All this is owing to a steady succession of genial rainfalls. The crop of Sugar is expected to be very large. This is very important for the colony, because Natal sugar has now become a favourite in the Australian markets. Coffee, Cotton, and all other products, look most promising, and a generally good yield is anticipated. Cotton, Flax, and other textile fabrics, are occupying attention in the colony. The average yield of Sea Island cotton will, it is said, be about 400lbs. of ginned cotton per acre. It is also now affirmed that cotton planting and sugar planting may be carried on successfully together, because at the time when labour is most wanted in the cotton fields it is least needed in the cane fields. Several patches of cotton, of a few acres each, are to be seen this year. But unless the Kafirs take to labour in the cotton fields, the labour question will be the great difficulty. The Flax that has been experimentally grown has given abundant yield, and the quality is reported as ""very good."" Wool is to become the favourite product of the upper country. There are continual importations of Sheep from the Cape, and of Rams of good breed from Australia and England. Some Alpacas are also expected from Australia.

But presuming that they are eligible for farming settlers, and that they will be put in good road communication with the central towns, Lord Carnarvon has given his assent to four plans; laying down, however, in reference to them, three absolute governing principles—i.e., 1. That all lands allotted shall front public roads. 2. That there shall be continuous occupation. 3. That perfect provision shall be made for the due reception and comfortable location of the settlers after their arrival.\n\nOf the plans, the first is: To grant 200 acres to heads of families possessing 500l.; alternate lots to be reserved for purchase within five years at 10s. per acre. The second plan: To settlers who will pay 5l. towards freight, and who can certify that they have means of support for six months after arrival, 50 acres with due right of commonage. Plan the third: Pastoral farmers to have lands on lease, not more than 1,000 acres, at a total rent of 12l. 10s. per year. These to be surrendered when wanted for agriculture, at six months' notice, but holders to have pre-emptive right to purchase 320 acres at 10s. per acre. The fourth plan is: That the Natal Immigration Agent in England shall keep a register of all lands of private proprietors that are for lease or sale.\n\nThese appear to us to be good regulations. We attach great importance to the private lands registry; because these lands are in the more central or settled districts, and many large proprietors would do well to sell half their uncultivated lands at a very low price to good immigrants, as they would thereby make the residue greatly more valuable.

J. Mann, ""On the Physical Geography of Natal,"" the author exhibited numerous diagrams and maps in illustration of his subject, which was to show how the peculiar climate and fertility of Natal depended upon its physical configuration. The colony was a portion of the narrow, bevelled rim of the African continent, whose vast interior is an elevated table-land, with its coasts presented to the moist winds of the Indian Ocean, and its interior frontier formed by the Drakenberg mountain ledge 7,000 to 9,000 feet high. From the salient point of the angular line of the Drakenberg a mountain ridge projects into the middle of the colony, forming a high central backbone, from which short lateral spurs jut out. Each deep valley has its stream, and no less than fifty separate rivers find their way to the coast. There is a general slope upwards from the sea towards the interior, the gradient for the first seventy miles being 1 in 70. Up this slope the sea breezes, impelled by the eastern trade-wind, blow almost continually, but most strongly in the summer, owing to the power of the sun on the land, and it is in this season that most rain falls, the moisture-laden air, on reaching the rising land, being no longer able to retain its humidity, and therefore discharging it in almost daily showers. During the winter, on the other hand, when the monsoon agency is at its least, there is almost perpetual sunshine, and the weather is dry. The summer rainfall, as the author had ascertained during eight years\' observation, is about 24 inches; the winter rainfall only 6 inches. The temperature in summer commonly rises to 85 deg. at midday, rarely to 97 deg., and at night very seldom descends to 52 deg.

420,British naval and military activities in Sierra Leone and surrounding areas during this period reflect a strategic effort to establish and maintain significant imperial influence and control in West Africa.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that British naval and military activities in Sierra Leone and surrounding areas during this period reflect a strategic effort to establish and maintain significant imperial influence and control in West Africa. The General History of Africa highlights Britain's intervention in the Vai region of north-western Liberia and Sierra Leone from 1860, leading to the annexation of most Vai chiefdoms to Sierra Leone in 1882, despite the lack of desire for British rule by the Vai chiefs. This action underscores a strategic move to expand British influence, further evidenced by Britain's use of both diplomacy and military force to conclude treaties of protection and engage in military confrontations, particularly to halt French expansion. The African Times complements this by detailing the presence of multiple British naval ships, such as Her Majesty's ships Narcissus, Rattlesnake, Adventure, and Supply, actively engaged in the region, and the dispatch of H.M.'s troopship Tyne and the Racer to Konakry and Sierra Leone, indicating a strong naval presence. The articles emphasize Sierra Leone's strategic importance as a British colony, serving as a center of government for West African colonies and a fortified coaling station. They also highlight ongoing boundary disputes with France and efforts to delineate spheres of influence, reflecting a broader imperial strategy to secure British interests. However, both sources acknowledge challenges, such as French competition and difficulties in maintaining control over trade routes and local alliances, complicating the narrative of unchallenged British dominance. Together, these observations illustrate the strategic military and naval activities aimed at reinforcing British influence in West Africa, while also highlighting the complexities and challenges faced in this endeavor.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that British naval and military activities in Sierra Leone and surrounding areas reflect a strategic effort to establish and maintain significant imperial influence and control in West Africa.

The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans. It should be emphasized that these reactions were very much determined by the local African situation. Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans. This was the classical era of treaty-making in practically every nook and corner of West Africa followed in most cases by military invasions, conquests and occupation by armies of varying sizes and discipline. The period from 1880 to 1900 was the high-water mark of European conquest and occupation of West Africa. Never in the known history of the continent has so much military action been seen and so many invasions and campaigns launched against African states and communities (see Fig. 6.1). Particularly memorable were the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey (now Benin) between 1880 and 1898, and the British campaigns in Asante (in what is now Ghana), the Niger Delta region (Nigeria) and in Northern Nigeria between 1895 and 1903 (see Fig. 6.2).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': 'The process of suppression', 'content': ""The reaction to these subterfuges was an increase in violence.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

This latter phase terminated only with the partition of the area between Britain and France in 1889. In all this, however, the point to emphasize is that the pattern of European activities at any particular time in the region was as much in response to the European metropolitan demands as to the stimulus of the local situation.\nIn the earlier phase European traders, explorers or travellers and Chris› tian missionaries operated in Africa without much concern for the national identities of the individual agents. A famous German explorer like Heinrich Barth served 'an official British expedition', while a British explorer of the calibre of H. M. Stanley was in the service of King Leopold of Belgium.

Smuts, in the face of real opposition from Afrikaner irreconcilables, to commit South African forces to the Allied side and invade German South West Africa (now Namibia), and later participate in the East African campaign.$^{7}$ Not only did Botha and Smuts covet South West Africa as a potential fifth province but they hoped that if they assisted a British victory in German East Africa, parts of conquered German territory might be offered to the Portuguese in exchange for Delagoa Bay - the natural port for the Transvaal - going to South Africa.$^{8}$ In Britain, it was considered that the involvement of South Africa and her loyalty would be ensured by the prospect of South West Africa becoming hers.$^{9}$ For the French, invasion of Cameroon would retrieve the territory reluctantly ceded in 1911 to Germany in the aftermath of the Agadir crisis (see Fig. 12.1b). Even Belgium, which had immediately invoked the perpetual neutrality of the Congo (now Zaire) under Article X of the Berlin Act, eagerly joined in the invasion of German African territory once her own neutrality had been violated by the Germans, in the hope that successful participation would give her a bargaining position in the eventual peace settlement. 10 Germany's colonies were not easily defensible given Allied naval supremacy and her much smaller colonial forces. There was early optimism that the anticipated speedy German victory in Europe would avoid direct colonial involvement while achieving Germany's ambition of a Mittelafrika linking Cameroon and German East Africa and thwarting once and for all Britain's longed-for Cape to Cairo route.$^{!}$ ' But once it was clear that quick victory would not be achieved, it was perceived that protracted campaigns in Africa would tie down Allied colonial troops who might otherwise be sent to the European"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The East African coast and hinterland, 1845-80', 'section_title': 'Increased European pressures', 'content': ""As we have already mentioned, during the period under discussion East Africa was part of a large informal empire under British control.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo. The most significant action of the period was the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow.

Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office.

There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river.

For the past twenty-five years France has been gradually closing in upon Sierra Leone, whose sole trade is in the various products which reach the coast from the interior. This trade is now a valuable one, the exports amounting to something like £400,000 a year, and the imports, mostly from England, to a similar sum. In August 1889, a convention was come to between the two countries as to the spheres of influence in the ""Hinterland,"" and it was agreed that the boundaries of Sierra Leone should not extend beyond 11:40 of longitude West of Greenwich and 10 degrees of latitude. Near the borderline was the important native town of Fararma, situated almost at the source of the River Niger. It is here that the native caravans on their way to Sierra Leone from the interior have to cross the river, and it is consequently a place of great commercial importance. On the French maps Fararma is shown well within the French boundary; but accurate observation demonstrates that it is really within the British limits, and the inhabitants of Sierra Leone are anxious to retain this important entrepôt of trade in their own hands.

Amongst these one of the most important was with Samory, the chieftain of the Mandingo States, which are conterminous with the north-eastern frontier of the English settlement of Sierra Leone. It was signed in 1885 in his capital of Bissandougon, and though he is now anxious to renounce his allegiance to the French Government and to place himself under English protection, he has never denied the authenticity of the document. The English commissioners had no treaties to oppose to those which were in the possession of the French. While the provisions of the treaty of 1882 with regard to the boundary of Sierra Leone were embodied in the agreement of 1889, it had become necessary in other respects to recognise existing facts. It was no longer possible to suggest that France should withdraw from her position either in the more southern portions of the coast or in the territories neighbouring upon Sierra Leone over which her protection had been accepted. The second article of the treaty fixes the northern frontier of that Colony as follows:—""The line of demarcation, after having divided the basin of the Mellacoree from that of the Great Scarcies, shall pass between Bennah and Tamhakka, leaving Talla to England and Tamisso to France, and shall approach the tenth degree of north latitude, including in the French zone the country of the Houbous, and in the English zone Soulimaniah and Fallaba. The line shall stop at the intersection of the 13th degree of longitude west of Paris (10° 40\' of Greenwich) and of the tenth degree of latitude."" Fallaba, which is situated at this point of intersection, marks, therefore, the north-eastern corner of the English territory of Sierra Leone. Beyond this no definite frontier line has been provided for, and the fear of English merchants interested in the caravan trade with the interior is that French authority will be exerted to prevent the currents of native trade which have their sources in countries subject to French influence from flowing as they now do through Fallaba to Freetown in order to turn them to the French outlet of Konakry. It appears that caravans coming from the Upper Niger to Sierra Leone have already been interfered with, and no surprise can be felt at the uneasiness with which merchants interested in the English trade must regard the prospects of the future. That France should desire to attract the trade of her hinterland to the ports of her own coast colonies is inevitable. Her intentions are shown by the instructions given to Lieut. Quiquendmon, who has lately conducted a mission through the Native States of the Upper Niger. His principal duties were to secure the markets and the commercial roads, and to prepare the way for the establishment of a French resident in one of the principal towns of the Upper Niger, whence it may be possible to extend French influence and French commerce through all the neighbouring States. These are the very States of Sigou, Sikoro, Tieba, &c., from which caravans have been in the habit of carrying native produce to Sierra Leone, and if Lieut. Quiquendmon is not deceived in the results of his activity, there is little doubt that the supremacy of France has been fully established in the regions through which he travelled. It is not in the estimate which they have formed of the position that the English Chambers of Commerce are likely to prove mistaken. French competition must be expected to grow keener with every year. It is the proposed remedy which is impossible. The kingdom of Samadoo which Lord Salisbury is petitioned to take under the protection of Great Britain falls within the acknowledged sphere of French influence and forms a part of the territories over which Colonel Archinard has lately conducted a military expedition. To accept offers of submission from its chief and to establish the political rights within his frontiers which the merchants of Liverpool desire would be a direct contravention of the spirit of all the African treaties of last year.', 'last_edit_date': '1892-01-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_01_1892#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Situation in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In view of the interest which attaches to the present situation of affairs in West Africa, and the issues which hang upon the campaign undertaken by the Royal Niger Company, it may be well, says *The Times*, to summarise briefly the leading features of the actual position and the steps by which that position has been reached.\n\nIn the first place it is necessary to distinguish between the situation on the coast and that in the interior, and for this purpose it is essential that the geography of the district should be present to the mind. The configuration of the basins of the rivers Niger and Binué as they float to the sea may be represented by the letter Y, of which the tail stands on the Atlantic coast. The distance from the confluence of the rivers to the coast is about 300 miles. The district is traversed from west to east by rising ground from which other rivers running parallel with the main flood of the Lower Niger flow also to the sea. These minor rivers are known under the general name of the Oil Rivers. Their mouths constitute coast ports where African trade has for a very long period been carried on. The names of the seven principal Oil Rivers are Benin, Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Quaebo, Opobo, and Old Calabar. The coast district through which they flow to the sea spreads east and west of the mouth of the Lower Niger, and forms one British dependency known as the Niger Coast Protectorate. It stretches from the frontier of Lagos to the Rio del Rey, which is the frontier of the German Cameroons. The mouths of the Niger and the territory lying round and enclosed by the rivers Niger and Binué up to the limits of the British *Hinterland* in the interior, constitute the sphere of influence of the Royal Niger Company, which for purposes of convenience may be spoken of as ""Nigeria."" Thus we get in this portion of British West Africa three separate British dependencies—the colony of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate filling up the space between the French and German frontiers upon the seaboard, with the Royal Niger Company\'s territory of Nigeria spreading Y-shaped into the interior and possessing on the coast only the narrow riverain strip by which it commands access to the sea. The colonies of Lagos and the Niger Coast Protectorate cover together about 3,000 square miles. Nigeria has an extent of about 500,000 square miles. For the administration of affairs upon the coast the Imperial Government is directly responsible. The administration of affairs in the interior is carried on under the charter granted about ten years ago to the Royal Niger Company.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Influence on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter has been addressed recently to Earl Granville by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the African Trade Section of that Chamber:—\n\n""My Lord,—I am requested by the Council of this Chamber to ask that your serious consideration may be given to the following facts, many of which are doubtless well known to you, but which have a special significance owing to the position of matters in West Africa at the present time. The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export. The traders have been, with few exceptions, British, and the capitalists mostly Liverpool merchants. The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo. He collected his scattered family, dependants, and slaves, and made his escape to the Opobo river.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power.

The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year. In West Africa Germany and France were beginning to stand together to challenge the British position on the Niger. The 'high tide of imperialism' had begun to flow. When Bismark convened the Berlin Conference in November 1884, the process of partitioning Africa had already started. In East Africa Carl Peters had already arrived in Zanzibar under the auspices of his Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation (German Colonization Society) and had gone inland to negotiate treaties. The British kept hoping that strengthening Seyyid Barghash's authority on the mainland would be enough to protect their interests without direct colonization."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

From the point of view of Britain, given her naval supremacy, the strategy as laid down by the Committee for Imperial Defence was to carry war to her enemy's colonies. To maintain this naval supremacy, Germany's African communications system and principal ports had to be put out of action. For the Allies, successful campaigns in Germany's colonial possessions might result in their being shared by the victors as spoils of war. This was certainly a major consideration in the decision of the Commandant-General of the South African forces, General Louis Botha, and the Minister of Defence, J. C.

Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria.

The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply.

It is proposed to reconstruct the dilapidated forts in all the settlements, and to erect fresh fortifications where they may be needed; and, besides this, it is in contemplation to increase the number of troops in Africa by the amalgamation of two or more regiments into one. Public attention being directed to the subject of defences, the importance of reorganizing the Militia which existed some years ago has been mooted by the local Press. In the first place, a Militia in the colony could be utilized in the event of any sudden outbreak in Africa requiring a large number of troops for an expedition or as a reserve force. It would also serve to protect the settlement from any hostile attack that might be directed against it. In the second place, its organization would preclude the necessity of augmenting the number of Regular troops to be stationed in Africa. The scheme for protection has been sufficiently matured to come into operation. The people of the Gold Coast have simultaneously applied for permission to establish a Rifle Corps as a Volunteer force for the protection of the colony—an organization similar in its details to the English Militia, and one whose importance has been recognized by Sir Garnet Wolseley.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment. It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A FRENCH IDEA OF BRITISH POLICY IN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**A FRENCH IDEA OF BRITISH POLICY IN AFRICA.**\n\n**PARIS, December 6.**—*La Paix* has a long article on the attempts made by the Jingoes to force the English Government into an ambitious and grasping African policy. There is a school in England, it says, which favours the idea of building up an East African dominion to maintain the Indian Empire. The means to that end are the sovereignty of the Turkish Sultan in Egypt, and of the Sultan of Zanzibar from Cape Gardafui to Mozambique. According to *La Paix*, the English Government has yielded to Jingo pressure in attempting to lay hold through Abyssinia on the port of Massowah. An English railway company is ready to make a railway from that point into the centre of Abyssinia. With this iron road and the Nile, England will be virtually mistress of the whole eastern side of Africa, save the territory which belongs to Portugal. The ocean dividing India from Africa has become an English sea. *La Paix* questions whether Great Britain, which supports with difficulty the burden of her Indian Empire, will be able to bear the weight of a vast East African dominion.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast. A most valuable arm they are likely to prove.

Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers.

This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued.

There is fibre there for our manufacturers of Lancashire and Yorkshire; there is gold, silver, copper, coal, precious stones, ivory, india-rubber, nitrate, indigo, antimony, guano, palm oil, kola, ebony, mahogany, gum-copal, potash, ginger, gum, iron, farinaceous foods, dye woods, tanning material, spices, coffee, tobacco, cocoa, cotton, and other produce. Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse. The wealth of West Africa is simply boundless, illimitable.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The present is a very critical time in the history of the British West African Colonies. It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power.

The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade. One of the latest East African acquisitions of importance is the Vitu region, the protection of which has been arranged by the German Colonial Association; but since this land was secured the East African Company has added to its possessions, the fresh acquisition taking in Port Durnford and a considerable stretch of coastland. Steps are now being taken to form a plantation company which will carry on operations in East Africa, and will cultivate tobacco, cotton, cocoa, &c. As yet great difficulty has been experienced in regard to the labour question. The natives are well behaved, but they do not show any inclination to work unless for the satisfaction of immediate needs, and directly these needs are covered, they betake themselves to idleness.

531,"Colonial expeditions in Africa during the late 19th century were often under-resourced and poorly organized, leading to high attrition rates, desertion, and failure due to logistical challenges, harsh conditions, and hostile interactions with local groups.","The examination of colonial expeditions in Africa during the late 19th century reveals a complex picture, as illustrated by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa provides a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the logistical challenges and harsh conditions, such as severe climate and diseases, that affected both European and African troops. However, it emphasizes the technical superiority of European weaponry and the strategic use of African auxiliaries, which often tipped the balance in favor of the colonizers. The textbook suggests that these expeditions were well-resourced, with significant financial and material backing from Europe, and portrays them as systematically organized, allowing European powers to maintain control despite occasional setbacks. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that many colonial expeditions were under-resourced and poorly organized, leading to high attrition rates, desertion, and failure. They provide examples such as Dr. Gouldsbury's expedition, which suffered from sickness and inadequate supplies, and Major Barttelot's expedition, which faced desertion and starvation. The articles highlight logistical challenges, including lack of transport and harsh conditions, as well as hostile interactions with local groups, which often resulted in attacks and the need for punitive measures. However, they also mention successful expeditions, like the French Expedition led by Abbé Debaize, which did not experience desertion or loss, indicating that not all expeditions were poorly organized or unsuccessful. Together, these sources offer a nuanced view of the varied experiences of colonial expeditions in Africa, reflecting both the challenges and successes encountered during this period.","The General History of Africa textbook provides a nuanced perspective on colonial expeditions in Africa during the late 19th century, which both supports and refutes the claim. The text acknowledges the logistical challenges and harsh conditions faced by European powers, such as the severe climate and diseases that affected both European and African troops. However, it also highlights the technical superiority of European weaponry and the strategic use of African auxiliaries, which often tipped the balance in favor of the colonizers. The text does not emphasize high attrition rates or desertion among European forces; instead, it points to the systematic organization and resource allocation that allowed European powers to maintain control, despite occasional setbacks. Furthermore, the text describes the colonial expeditions as well-resourced, with significant financial and material backing from Europe, contrasting with the claim of being under-resourced. Overall, while the textbook acknowledges some logistical challenges, it portrays colonial expeditions as relatively well-organized and ultimately successful in imposing control over African territories.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that colonial expeditions in Africa during the late 19th century were often under-resourced and poorly organized, leading to high attrition rates, desertion, and failure. For instance, the articles mention the expedition led by Dr. Gouldsbury, which suffered from sickness, insufficient provisions, and inadequate medical supplies, resulting in illness and death among the men. Similarly, the expedition under Major Barttelot faced desertion and starvation, with a significant loss of personnel. The articles also describe logistical challenges, such as the lack of transport and the harsh conditions faced by the carriers, leading to desertion and inefficiency. Hostile interactions with local groups are highlighted in several accounts, including attacks on expeditions and the need for punitive measures, as seen in the accounts of Captain von Gravenreuth's expedition and M. Crampel's journey. These examples align with the claim by illustrating the difficulties faced by colonial expeditions due to poor planning, resource shortages, and challenging environments. However, the articles also mention some successful expeditions, such as the French Expedition led by Abbé Debaize, which did not experience desertion or loss, suggesting that not all expeditions were poorly organized or unsuccessful.

Apart from the technical superiority of their enemies' weapons, they had no real compensatory advantage over the conquerors. To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems. Finally, like Africans elsewhere, those of West Africa, except Samori, had to use outmoded weapons such as dane guns and bows and arrows in the face of cannon and the Maxim gun.

Within a decade the system had spread to the other two areas and remained intact until almost the First World War. Indeed AndrØ Gide found substantial remnants in the late 1920s. 69 Great similarities existed in each of the systems. The Africans discovered that they no longer owned even their accumulated ivory and that they had to kill elephants for more ivory and scour the forest for rubber. Some of the most callous riffraff of Europe drifted in to become agents for the concessionaires, and to an extraordinary degree they were permitted to utilize the apparatus of the colonial administration including its army, police and courts. Taxation and compulsory labour, although in theory limited, were reinterpreted by the agents to mean such continuous work that crop planting and, consequently, diet suffered very considerably. The population grew reluctant to toil collecting, and to hand over what had always been communally theirs. Imprisonment was an unsatisfactory punishment as it reduced the available labour. Instead, floggings, mutila› tion, the taking as hostages of women and children, the burning of villages and a considerable amount of killing were employed. Undoubtedly disease and famine followed the break-up of the village organization of labour and the flight of whole villages.$^{70}$ No one kept adequate population records See J.

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

In Nyasaland large numbers of lakeside Tonga and Tumbuka migrated from the Rukuru watershed to outside the sphere of British control to avoid paying taxes; 43 Creation of refugee communities in desolate areas constituted a variant of the withdrawal strategy.

Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour. Considerable expenditure was needed to provide certain African ports with deep berths and viable off-loading capacity;$^{2}$ but this was less onerous than the capital which had to be invested in arterial roads or railways penetrating the hinterland. Therefore, distance from the coast was one of the determinants of how early the colonial economy could be set in motion.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Conclusion', 'content': ""By the first decade of the twentieth century there were practically no indigenous sovereign states in Southern Africa.

In reality it was a different form of response to the struggles against colonial conquest and occupation, and it belongs to a different chapter in African history. For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': 'At a time when the Allied colonial regimes in Africa could least afford trouble in their own backyards, their authority - still only tenuously established in places like southern Ivory Coast, much of Libya, or Karamoja in Uganda - was widely challenged by armed risings and other forms of protest by their subjects. As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states. Even the YarsØ of the Mossi country, pre› viously so flexible in both religious and political affairs, began to take up much more rigid positions and engaged in proselytism.

They are now, as they have always been, and always will be, while they can find a purchase for their horrid merchandise—*Slave Traders.* There must be a change, and that speedily. The growing enterprise of this colony will not allow itself to be kept in check, and excluded from the rich commerce of the interior of the continent *through its natural channels, the rivers,* merely because the Portuguese have established a slave-trade authority on the coast. The sooner Her Majesty's Government comes to some understanding with the Portuguese for the freedom of commerce on the eastern rivers the better—if not, there will be far more serious collision between the Portuguese and our people than have yet taken place. The Zambesi Mission, too, which might have done great good, will certainly have to decamp in a very short time, if what we hear from home be true. You have told me that the Government will not continue the 5,000l. a-year for the Zambesi expedition any longer. Well, all I can say is, that if it cuts that off, it is bound, in justice to the Oxford and Cambridge Mission, to do something to secure them not only free access by the river, but entire protection as regards the slavetraders, and their infamous agents, natives and others. All the evildoing in the country they are the cause of, and they ought to be held responsible for it, and made to pay heavily. The proper way for the British Government, according to my mind, is to make the Portuguese domination on the East Coast so expensive for Portugal, that she may be only too glad to get rid of it. Then we shall get quit of another of the world's great nuisances—the presence of the Portuguese on the coast.\n\nWe have every prospect of good harvests this year.

The *Daily News* correspondent partially accounts for the difficulty as follows: ""It may be as well to inquire a little more closely into the causes of these grave defections on the part of the natives, for on the question of sufficient transport hangs now the success or failure of the expedition. Men are deserting right and left; a few days ago, a hundred disappeared at once. It surely cannot be that their pay is insufficient, although this is said to be a reason, for they were never possessed of so much money as they are now. There is, unfortunately, an unpleasant aspect of the question, and that is when it is viewed from the standpoint of the black man. The carriers declare they are badly fed and cruelly treated. This will doubtless form the subject of much correspondence hereafter; meanwhile this is what Quashie avers, and, resenting it, deserts. During the greater portion of his past life his existence has been easy, not to say slothful. His wife has toiled for him, and supplied him with means to obtain food and rum; whilst he has to the full enjoyed the *dolce far niente*. Suddenly called upon to work or fight, his fears of the dreaded Ashantee prompt him to become a carrier. But he is brought into contact with a hard taskmaster. An English officer—vigorous, untiring, stern, his very antithesis in character—receives orders to see certain stores taken to a certain point within a given time, and for this purpose he is allowed a fixed number of bearers, each of whom receives his proportion of the whole, and carry it he must. If there is any disposition on his part, as most probably there is, to grumble at the weight of the load, the officer cannot afford the time to hear complaints, and very likely will touch him up with a big stick. If he complain of sickness, he is told he is shamming, which is not at all improbable, and is again touched up. If he wish to linger over his rations at a halting place, he is roused up as soon as the last second of the time allowed has expired, and it is again perhaps necessary to introduce the stick. And then neither can properly understand what the other says. The Englishman, because the native does not at once comprehend an order given, it may be hurriedly, considers him a stupid, thick-headed fellow. The officer may plead necessity if he use strong means to have his orders carried out, but looking at Quashie\'s former life, it is not very surprising that he should take the first opportunity that presents itself to escape from a service which he finds in the last degree irksome and intolerable. The question of procuring transport is daily becoming more important, as not an hour even can be wasted now. Bullocks have been pressed into the carrying service, but 500 mules would be invaluable now, even if they only lived to carry one load. The contingent of women have behaved admirably, and very often they have done the bulk of the carrying. They have been used to hard work, the men have not.""

They had no papers, but the officers accepted the report a fact, and an officers\' mess meeting proposed that my instructions should be cancelled.

The land slopes from the plateau above the Nyanza down to the Congo from 5,000 ft. to 1,400 ft. above the sea. North and south of our track the face of the land was much broken by groups of cones or isolated mounts or ridges. North we saw no land higher than about 6,000 ft. above the sea, but about fifty miles from our camp on the Nyanza we saw a towering mountain, its summit covered with snow, and probably 17,000 ft. or 18,000 ft. above the sea. It is called Ruwenzori, and will probably prove a rival to Kilimanjaro. It may be the Gordon Bennett Mountain in Gambaragara, but there are two reasons for doubting it to be the same—first, it is too far west, and we saw no snow on the Gordon Bennett.\n\nBefore closing, let me touch more at large on the subject which brought me to this land—viz., Emin Pasha.

Crampel, who left France with M. Brazza in Feb. 1887, has just returned to Paris, and has given an interesting account of his adventures in the Journal des Débats. On August 12, 1888, he started from Lastoursville on the river Ogoové, with the intention of travelling north and then west, so as to regain the coast between the rivers Benito and Campo. He was accompanied by about thirty natives, only two of whom carried firearms. Not finding a direct route to the north he was obliged to describe a large curve to the east, thus coming in contact with tribes which had never seen a white man, and experiencing considerable delay from the palavers which this rendered necessary. On October 1 he reached the river Ivindo, a large tributary of the Ogoové, the course of which lies almost due north. Travelling along the banks of this river, he discovered the river N'Tem, the name of which is known on the coast, but which had never before been seen by Europeans, unless it is identical with the Campo. Very soon the stifling atmosphere of the forests, scarcity of food, and difficulty of communicating with the natives, made progress exceedingly difficult. More than half of M. Crampel's attendants lay down on the ground and refused to go any further. They were left behind with the baggage, while the explorer, with twelve Adoumas pushed on to the east, where was said to be a large lake. He found, not a lake, but a river, the waters of which, covering an immense bed, have scarcely any current. It is called the Djah, and is supposed to be a tributary of the Likoli. The people of this region, the M'Fangs, or Pahouins, had hardly heard of the existence of white men. M. Crampel was very anxious to take one of them with him to Europe, and after three months of negotiations, when all the chiefs met at a grand palaver, and invited him to select one of their daughters for his wife, he chose the daughter of the most powerful chief. The marriage was solemnly celebrated, and Niarinzhe accompanied her husband when he returned to his followers who had been left with the baggage. He now succeeded in persuading them to move, and the whole party turned in the direction of the coast. Soon he discovered the river Komm, which is a tributary of the N'Tem, but soon also were his difficulties renewed. His attendants, worn out once more by the fatigues of travelling through forest, march, and bush, again came to a standstill, and he was obliged to take to the river. Eight rafts of combo-combo were constructed, and the party descended the Komm to its confluence with the N'Tem. The natives, however, were hostile, and M. Crampel and his party were in great danger. Ambushes were laid on both sides of the river, from which shots were fired at the rafts, two of the blacks being killed, and the leader receiving two wounds. At last he induced his men, or rather those who continued faithful, for the porters had deserted him on Feb. 1, to abandon the river and plunge into the forest. Travelling was very difficult and painful, as he was severely wounded and afflicted with fever, but he persevered, and after fifteen days reached a village on the banks of the N'Tem, where he was received with distrust. He therefore resumed his journey almost immediately, and reached Bata on March 3, having traversed after he had been wounded more than 180 miles. He has returned to France by way of Liverpool, bringing Niarinzhe with him. The wonders of civilisation do not surprise her; she regards them as fetishes. The flocks of sheep, however, which she saw on the way from Liverpool to London, gave her a high opinion of the riches of white men. M. Crampel has still a ball in the leg, but it is expected that European skill will be able to extract it.""}, {'id': 6012, 'article_title': 'DR. PETERS IN AFRICA.', 'full_section_title': 'DR.

On May 8 he resumed his journey, and marched through Neera, fighting his way as Stanley had done before him, and then, not wishing to follow exactly on the track of Stanley, he branched off along the Wembaere river, which is practically the south-eastern boundary of the Macai country, many of whom he saw on the other side of the river, but they did not attack him. He next passed through Iramba and Ussure, at both of which places he hoisted the German flag, eventually reaching Ugogo from the north. Here the Sultan Makenga, “because he was not inclined to propitiate him with presents as Stanley had done,” attacked him with an alarming force of 1,500 men, but again Peters was victorious, and, utterly routing Makenga, burned twelve of his villages, and took large numbers of cattle and sheep from him. Makenga now asked for peace, and paid Peters tribute for it. Peters then proceeded, and reached Mpwapwa on June 19, where he found Emin, and stayed three days with him, eventually reaching the coast at Bagamoyo on July 16 with only thirty-six porters and ten Somalis of his force left.

On Nov. 3 a punitive expedition, under Captain von Gravenreuth, numbering altogether 160 men, embarked on board the Habicht for Buea. The Bueas seem to have expected an expedition, for at one place alone they had bought about 200 barrels of powder and shot, and had fortified themselves. On the 5th, about 3.30, the first company reached the palisades at Buea. It was intended to hold a palaver, but the German summons was answered by a howl, and at once the expedition was fired on.

About four o\'clock Captain von Gravenreuth fell. Von Schuckmann sprang towards him to assist him, when a second shot fired at close quarters struck him. With the words, \'Von Stetten takes the command,\' Gravenreuth passed away in Schuckmann\'s arms. The situation was now critical. The gun was injured, Gravenreuth had fallen, and our people were so demoralised that they had to be driven forward with the butt end of our guns. But Von Stetten succeeded in collecting them again, and penetrated into the village, where he met the non-commissioned officer Volckauer, who had entered the palisades at another spot. The Buea people fled, and ours took possession. In the course of the following day the nearest houses were burnt down, and the cattle driven together. On Sunday morning, before daybreak, Captain von Gravenreuth was buried, after his head and heart had been packed in a metal box to be taken to the coast. Then the expedition left and wandered about in the forest till the following Friday, hungry and wet.

Herr Holub and his wife, who had accompanied him, with great difficulty succeeded in making their escape, and he has recently sent to the _Neue Freie Presse_ an interesting account of the catastrophe. He says that he had, after great difficulty, succeeded in reaching the territory of the Maschukulumbe. In this part of Africa it is impossible to obtain porters who are willing to give their services for the whole of the journey. The negroes are unwilling to leave the territory of their own tribe, and, as the villages are independent and often in a state of open hostility with their neighbours, it is necessary to change porters three or four times a day. Some men whom Herr Holub had engaged from the Matokas left him as soon as the expedition had reached the territory of the Maschukulumbe. They feared an attack from this tribe, which Herr Holub regards as the very scum of the negro race. When he reached the country to the north of Suenge he had lost half of his 70 bales of goods. He determined to rest a little in this region. Some of the Maschukulumbe informed him that a Portuguese trader was within a few hours' march, and that he would do well to go and meet him and make arrangements for reaching the Mankvu territory. Herr Holub, leaving his encampment in charge of two blacks who had remained faithful to him, and of two white men, Messrs. Fehete and Sollner, started to meet this Portuguese trader, but when he had gone some distance and could hear no tidings of him he began to suspect he had been betrayed, and hurried back to his encampment. On the way back he met Herr Fehete and the two blacks, who had fled from the encampment, which had been attacked during his absence and Herr Sollner killed. The small band, finding it impossible to return to the encampment, had to travel 400 miles in order to reach the Zambesi, without any baggage or ammunition, and Herr Holub had lost all his equipments and the natural history collections which he had got together at so much cost and labour. After enduring terrible privations he and his scanty band of followers succeeded in reaching the territory of the Matokas, not being able at last to march more than seven miles a day. Herr Holub was suffering from fever, and, to make matters worse, the King of the Matokas at first received him very badly at Mapanze, and refused to give him any assistance. But he changed his mind, and so Herr Holub was able to continue his route, and soon after, at the mouth of the River Tchobe, he got news of the presence of three English travellers, from whom he obtained further relief and whom he asked to forward to Europe this narrative of his sufferings."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1887#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Abbé Debaize, in charge of the French Expedition sent to Africa, has written to the Director of the Paris Observatory a most interesting letter, full of curious details, concerning the ""Dark Continent,"" and the various expeditions which are now exploring it. The letter is dated from Kuihara, near Taboza, and was written on the 17th of October. The Abbé Debaize naturally begins with his own expedition, which had so far been successful. He says: ""Yesterday the caravan of the French Expedition, with flags flying and music playing, entered Kouikouron, the capital of Unyanyembe. The most sympathetic reception was given to us by the thousands of negroes who gathered round us. The Sultan and the Governor came out to receive us at the entrance to the capital, and conducted us to a vast building, the same as was given to Cameron when he passed here.

Of the five hundred men forming my caravan not one has deserted, and I have not lost a single thing. From Zanzibar to the present spot I have not ceased to enjoy perfect health.""\n\nThe other expeditions do not appear to be so well favoured. The Abbé Debaize alludes to two in particular—namely, the Belgian Expedition and that of the Missionary Fathers of Algeria. As regards the Belgians, he says: ""They have experienced troubles of all kinds. At Meromero a revolt broke out in their camp. Two hundred and eighty of their men abandoned them, carrying off with them a quantity of valuable goods. At Mpuapona one of their Zanzibar men was wounded by a native.\n[APRIL 1, 1879.]\n\n---\n\nTo avenge him, they killed five of the inhabitants. The whole of the country rose, and war was imminent. The English were obliged to interfere to put an end to the affair.

The missionaries from Algeria, who are going to establish stations on Lake Tanganyika and in the Uganda country, have not been more fortunate than the Belgians. They had to pay a ruinous sum for the right to pass through the Ugogo. They were abandoned by their native servants, and, in addition, attacked by a band of brigands, who stole several valuable chests from them.

According to accounts which from time to time have been received in England, the missionaries have had to undergo terrible hardships, and the latest information shows that those of the party who are alive are in a most deplorable condition. The party, on leaving Liverpool, included men, women, and children, and were evidently totally unacquainted with the nature of the country they were going to. In a very short time after their arrival many of them were stricken down with fever, and soon death terminated the sufferings of several. The missionaries appear to have been ill-provided with funds, and although two or three of the party have returned home, they were only enabled to do so by the consideration of the English steamship companies trading to the port. A gentleman who has been engaged in trading at St. Paul de Loanda for some time past has just arrived in England, and from him some very sad facts have been obtained. So badly off were the party at latest accounts that they had sent a request to the trading houses to be given the leavings of their tables. Many of the party, if they acted on the promptings of their own feelings, would return to America, but they were afraid of being accused of acting in their own interests, and abandoning the noble work they went out to pursue.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

The first was the expedition of the Baron Van Derdecken, to explore the interior of Africa, from Zanzibar, where he intended to go up one of the rivers. He fitted out the expedition entirely at his own expense. He, it would be remembered, was the first to settle the point of the existence of a large snowy mountain in Africa, under the Equator.

Du Chaillu, who had devoted the whole of the little fortune realised by the sale of his book to fit out a little vessel suited for his purpose. When he arrived out he had to wait for instruments, but did not waste his time, since he sent gorillas and plenty of other curiosities to the British Museum. When he reached the interior the small-pox broke out among the natives, and as they considered that he and his party had brought the disease among them, dissensions followed. M. Du Chaillu had encountered great difficulties, but he (the speaker) was not yet well informed as to their nature. However, he had received a telegram from M.

What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Royal Mail steamer Axim, which arrived in the Mersey on Sept. 11, having left Accra on August 28, reported trade as in a very bad state, practically little or no produce coming down from the interior. This, it was stated, was owing to the district being raided by hostile tribes. There was a great deal of poverty in the interior in consequence of the unsettled state of the country, and some places were threatened with famine. Three hundred Hausa troops had left Accra for Elmina just before the Axim sailed, to be sent into the disturbed districts. The Princes John and Albert Ansah were at Cape Coast when the Axim passed. It was reported that they intended soon to visit England for the purpose of bringing their case before the British Parliament, and submitting a claim for wrongful arrest.

Within the last six years the Church Missionary Society had sent out to West Africa and the Niger about sixty missionaries, all of whom, in one way or another, have suffered severely from the climate: of these twelve had died and fourteen returned to England and would not be reckoned on again for service in Africa, for which only thirty-six were now available.\n\nM. de Belarbre, writing from Sierra Leone to the Paris Débats, gives a startling account of the secret cannibal society, styled ""The Human Leopards,"" which in the last 20 years has made hundreds of victims. The society was formed among the Imperi in the Isle of Sherbro, part of the colony of Sierra Leone. It originated in a desire for vengeance for the death of a troop of warriors, who while on an expedition were slaughtered by the Imperi. A sorcerer who was consulted devised a fetish called boffima, the owner of which would have all his wishes gratified. It is a tuber, the size of an ostrich\'s egg, which is hollowed out, filled with some secret mixture, and enveloped in leopard\'s hide. To retain its virtue it had to be occasionally greased with human fat. Every candidate for admission to the society undertook to inveigle some relative, slave, or neighbour, to a gathering, at which this stranger was murdered by a member wearing a leopard\'s hide, and the body was eaten. A few years ago the chiefs of the district formed a rival society for exterminating those cannibals, but innocent persons having been murdered through false denunciations, the English authorities put it down. As, however, the outrages then revived, a spy was induced to give information which led to the arrest of six ""human leopards."" One died in prison and the other five have been tried and hanged. The last cry of one of them was—""The leopards still exist.""', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V. Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A correspondent of the *Cape Times*, at Zanzibar, writes: “Mr. Thomson has come back after a most successful journey.

Operating from its coastal possessions on the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in Nigeria, Britain halted effectively French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887.

The effective occupation of Igboland and some other areas of the eastern hinterland, however, were not accom› plished until the first two decades of this century. To the north, British conquest was accomplished from Nupe, where - by 1895 - George Goldie's Royal Niger Company exercised influence from Lokoja to the sea. Ilorin was occupied in 1897; and after the establishment of the West African Frontier Force in 1898 the Sokoto sultanate was conquered by Lugard in 1902.\nIn North Africa, Britain, already in a commanding position in Egypt, waited until 1896 when the reconquest of the Sudan was authorized. This was achieved in 1898 with savage and unnecessary bloodshed. Over 20000 Sudanese, including their leader, Khalifa 'Abdallah, died in battle.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act.

Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The War on African soil', 'content': ""The forces in favour of involving Germany's African possessions in the war were, however, more pressing. From the point of view of Britain, given her naval supremacy, the strategy as laid down by the Committee for Imperial Defence was to carry war to her enemy's colonies. To maintain this naval supremacy, Germany's African communications system and principal ports had to be put out of action. For the Allies, successful campaigns in Germany's colonial possessions might result in their being shared by the victors as spoils of war. This was certainly a major consideration in the decision of the Commandant-General of the South African forces, General Louis Botha, and the Minister of Defence, J. C. Smuts, in the face of real opposition from Afrikaner irreconcilables, to commit South African forces to the Allied side and invade German South West Africa (now Namibia), and later participate in the East African campaign.$^{7}$ Not only did Botha and Smuts covet South West Africa as a potential fifth province but they hoped that if they assisted a British victory in German East Africa, parts of conquered German territory might be offered to the Portuguese in exchange for Delagoa Bay - the natural port for the Transvaal - going to South Africa.$^{8}$ In Britain, it was considered that the involvement of South Africa and her loyalty would be ensured by the prospect of South West Africa becoming hers.$^{9}$ For the French, invasion of Cameroon would retrieve the territory reluctantly ceded in 1911 to Germany in the aftermath of the Agadir crisis (see Fig. 12.1b). Even Belgium, which had immediately invoked the perpetual neutrality of the Congo (now Zaire) under Article X of the Berlin Act, eagerly joined in the invasion of German African territory once her own neutrality had been violated by the Germans, in the hope that successful participation would give her a bargaining position in the eventual peace settlement. 10 Germany's colonies were not easily defensible given Allied naval supremacy and her much smaller colonial forces.

The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe. Their venture to establish an agricultural farm in Waalo with a military post in Bakel to protect it had been a failure. In North Africa, they seized Algiers in 1830. They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions.

There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria.

This country has undertaken, in conjunction with Germany, to establish a blockade upon the East Coast, and this blockade is to be ""against the importation of the munitions of war and the exportation of slaves; and for nothing else."" Thus the policy and intentions of England are clearly defined. We wish the same could be said for Germany. Says Lord Salisbury: ""There is no ground for believing that the Germans have any intention to resort to action on shore. We have merely engaged in certain naval operations, and have not the slightest intention of engag...\n[Dec. 3, 1888.]\n\ning in military operations."" What we have undertaken will be conducted chiefly on the coast which falls under British influence. In no case will British ships be called upon to afford support to any military movement which may be attempted by the German forces on shore. It is necessary to lay stress on this, because it appears that in some parts of Germany, at least, a desire is shown for the employment of military forces on shore. Lord Salisbury makes light of the apprehensions lest the natives of the blockaded coasts may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags. So long as England and Germany are engaged in carrying out a policy which England has made her own for many years past there is no reason why this difficulty should arise. We rejoice that Germany recognizes a duty to civilization which England has long discharged single-handed, and co-operate with her in a course of action from which we could not have held aloof without abandoning our traditional policy and doing violence to national sentiment. But if Germany is resolved upon making her efforts for the suppression of the slave-trade subservient to an attempt to recover her position in East Africa, there is only too much reason to fear that the natives may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags when they see them associated together.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West African News', 'section_title': '', 'content': '**WEST AFRICAN NEWS.**\n\n**SIERRA LEONE, Sept. 1 (via Liverpool).**—The reported intention of the British Government to improve the defences of the West African Colonies meets with general approval here. It is proposed to reconstruct the dilapidated forts in all the settlements, and to erect fresh fortifications where they may be needed; and, besides this, it is in contemplation to increase the number of troops in Africa by the amalgamation of two or more regiments into one. Public attention being directed to the subject of defences, the importance of reorganizing the Militia which existed some years ago has been mooted by the local Press. In the first place, a Militia in the colony could be utilized in the event of any sudden outbreak in Africa requiring a large number of troops for an expedition or as a reserve force. It would also serve to protect the settlement from any hostile attack that might be directed against it. In the second place, its organization would preclude the necessity of augmenting the number of Regular troops to be stationed in Africa. The scheme for protection has been sufficiently matured to come into operation. The people of the Gold Coast have simultaneously applied for permission to establish a Rifle Corps as a Volunteer force for the protection of the colony—an organization similar in its details to the English Militia, and one whose importance has been recognized by Sir Garnet Wolseley.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

It is impossible for a mighty empire like that of Great Britain to undertake such an expedition as that against barbarous Ashanti, on behalf of almost equally uncivilized Fanti, without necessities arising for changes, the effects of which will endure long after the brief struggle shall have terminated, and which may exercise an enormous influence on the future relations of the protector and protected. We see many of these changes coming into view on the near horizon. It is not necessary, however, that we should at present call attention to more than one of them. Ashanti must be conquered and humbled, or destroyed (the power we mean, not the country or the people). In the effort to effect this the first steps have been taken in a change that may be of vast importance. The power of Great Britain has, in many points, a resemblance to that of ancient Rome. Like that, it has to do with hosts of semi-civilized or barbarous people in regions distant from its centre, and in great varieties of climates; and it must be looked upon as a great waste of central resources and strength to be prodigal of the lives of its strictly imperial citizens, or subjects, in far distant countries, where the climate is unsuited to their physical constitutions. The Roman Governments understood this thoroughly. With forces drawn from countries already conquered, and an admixture of Romans, they conquered other countries. We do not say that under analogous circumstances Rome would not have sent to the Gold Coast troops corresponding in their army with those—the 42nd, 23rd, and Rifles—which we have dispatched thither; but one thing we do say, that she would forthwith have set about organizing tributary forces of less value to occupy and hold what these 42nd, 23rd, and Rifles should have subdued. The lamentable loss of life in West Africa has long since drawn our attention to this matter. On the outbreak of the war, we inclined to urge upon the Government the advisability of looking for volunteers in the East Indies, among the Sepoys or Sikhs; but we imagined that Her Majesty's Government must know its own business best in such a matter. The Roman system has been adopted to a considerable extent in the East Indies; and this war has led to a commencement of it in West Africa. The West India regiments, hitherto generally employed, have suffered from the climate pretty nearly as much as the European troops would do; and have been not much less costly. The exigencies of the present expedition have led to the subvention, the drilling, and partial disciplining of Houssas, Yorubas, and others. We would have this beginning of change persevered with, and a system for West Africa, founded upon the principle of employing Africans for Africa, raised to the rank of a policy. Until such changes shall take place among the Fantee and other Gold Coast tribes, as should enable a dependable force to be organized among them, let the necessary force employed be composed of Africans from other countries, such as are now serving with Sir Garnet Wolseley and Captain Glover. It may also become a matter of Imperial policy to hold Kumasi. If so, let it be held by troops of this character, under British officers. They would increase day by day in efficiency; and every drilled and disciplined man of them, master of his Snider, and supported by Artillery and Rocket Brigade (and such corps could, no doubt, within a short time be formed with the same human materials),—every disciplined man among them, we say, will be more than equal to fifty of the hitherto renowned warriors of Ashanti, practised only in the use of smooth-bore trade guns and muskets, and supplied with ammunition rarely fatal in its effects at fifty yards' distance. The adoption of some such imitation of the Roman system in West Africa is of immense importance as regards its future. The British Government and people, although so deeply interested in, and so ardently anxious for, its civilization, have been almost afraid to touch it, because the doing so seemed as a necessity to demand the constant employment of British troops. No such deterrent would any longer interfere with the so much to be desired action of civilization upon barbarism, when once the formation of West African corps for West African service shall have been definitively adopted and pursued."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""This meeting views with satisfaction the attention paid by her Majesty\'s Government to British interests in Africa, and trusts that the results of their policy may be beneficial alike to the natives and to the legitimate enterprise of British subjects in that continent.""\n\nAfter an animated discussion, in which various gentlemen interested took part, the resolution was carried unanimously.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.615, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900', 'content': 'While the French resorted mainly to warfare in their occupation of French West Africa during the period 1880 to 1900, the British, by contrast, used a combination of peaceful diplomacy and warfare.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible.

It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Because Nyungu made innovations in the administrative structure of his 'empire', when he died it survived until it was dismantled by the colonialists. On the other hand, Mirambo's 'empire' broke up into its constituent states simply because there was no successor who could maintain the strong army required to keep it together."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 189, 'article_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'last_edit_date': '06-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'Classified medical returns of the colonial hospitals, Sierra Leone, for thirteen years, are in the possession of the Statistical Society.

He says: ""They are generally runaway slaves, yet discipline and their elevation from serfs to freemen soon enable them to appreciate their improved position. When claimed by their owners (a circumstance which is constantly occurring), an arrangement is made to indemnify them, and redeem the slave by the payment of 8l. sterling, that sum being deducted by instalments from the man\'s pay. Their services during the Kroboe revolt, in 1858, and disturbance in the Abra district, in 1859, showed their value as soldiers."" It is, therefore, with no small regret that we have lately had occasion to refer to the mutinous conduct of these men; but judging from all we have heard of the cause of their insubordination, the conclusion has forced itself upon our minds that these outbreaks never would have occurred had their officers known how to govern them and obtain their respect; and should the cause of these mutinies ever be adequately inquired into, we have strong reason for believing it would then be found that, however guilty the men may have been, they have been sinned against as well as sinning.\n\nMr. Clarke thus describes the privileges enjoyed by the officers of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps; but before quoting further from his paper on this head, we may remark that he has overlooked one of their most valued privileges—viz., that they undergo no preliminary examination prior to being appointed. This escape from the ordeal or test of efficiency should, we conceive, be no longer tolerated, as it has unquestionably led to the admission of men of inferior attainments:—\n\n""The officers have the privilege of holding civil appointments, and promotion is very rapid, not so much from death vacancies as from officers being transferred to other regiments of the line, or from retiring on half-pay.

The Court has decided that you were right; that never could accusations be more destitute of foundation; that they must have originated in, and been urged by malice; and they have given a judgment of 2,000l. damages for Blankson against the kings and chiefs who clamoured for his being put to death. One of the gross injustices of the war period has thus been redressed, as far as courts of law can redress such matters.\n\nThere is no particular news from Ashanti at present, and trade is very dull.\n\nThe question of the seat of Government for the Colony of the Gold Coast seems to be now at last determined. The decision has rested with Captain Sale, R.N. I do not know what peculiar aptitude he has for deciding so knotty a point, but I suppose there were good reasons why the matter was referred to his judgment and decision. My own opinion quite goes along with that of Captain Sale. Christiansborg Castle, that magnificent and hitherto neglected building, is now undergoing\n\nthorough cleansing. No better place on the whole Coast could have been selected for the residence of the Governor. It will be connected with the Hill stations, Abure and Akrapong (by wires), where there is at all times a healthy atmosphere. Accommodation is to be prepared at Christiansborg for 300 troops, at first I believe West Indian soldiers, and afterwards Native Armed Police Force. The offices are to be erected outside the Castle, in detached buildings. The brig ""Dromo,"" of Messrs. F. and A. Swanzy, has been chartered here, and all necessary materials, huts, planks, showtanks, &c., are being shipped in her for Accra. She has previously made one trip to that place, and is now receiving materials for her second trip. Mr. Engineer Lawson, from Elmina, has been transferred to Accra, to superintend the important operations now needed in that district. He had before been engaged in laying out the new town at Elmina, and latterly in erecting what is to be hoped will be a permanent bridge over the Sweet River.

We limit ourselves, on this occasion, to merely calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Government, of Lord Carnarvon, and Captain Sir George Cumine Strahan, whose decisions have already been so beneficial to the Gold Coast, to this renewed testimony by Captain Glover of the superior merits of professed Gold Coast Christians as soldiers. Those men, and others equally good, no doubt still exist, and might be obtained by proper regulations and inducements, for the important Government service for which we have recommended them. There can be little doubt that the facilities for obtaining the services of these Accra men, will have been increased by the removal of the seat of Government for the Colony to Accra. Our space at present will not allow us to do more than thus briefly recall attention to the arguments adduced by us in our March number, and to express the hope that we shall soon hear of so wise and politic a step having been adopted by the Gold Coast Executive, under advice and assistance from home.

Captain Sir John Glover had again given his public testimony to the superior merits of the Christian portion of the force that was under his command at Addah, &c., during the late war. As the introducer of the Houssa Armed Police, Captain Sir John Glover could have had no desire to ""place them in the shade"" by this eulogy of the Christian volunteers; and his testimony, thus reiterated, ought to have, and we trust will have, great weight with the superior authorities in their consideration of this grave question of the formation of a permanent Armed Police Force for the Gold Coast, leading them in the direction that we have recommended. Among the reasons which should determine them to adopt our views and suggestions, those of the interests of trade (upon which so much depends, as it alone is the source of all the public revenues of the Colony) are far from being unimportant. In letters lately received from the Gold Coast, we find, attached to the news of the comparative stagnation of trade, the opinion that this may possibly be caused ""by the conduct of the Houssa Police Force stationed at Prashu."" From the moment of the introduction of this armed Houssa Police Force on the Gold Coast, complaint has been made of their predatory habits, and other acts of violence; and so much apprehension was felt by many European and educated native commercial residents at being left entirely at the mercy of these men, unrestrained by any regular military force which might be employed in case of need for restraint and punishment of their excesses, that they strongly insisted on the absolute necessity of retaining permanently the services on the Gold Coast of a few companies at least of the West Indian soldiers. Although, therefore, the nature of ""the (obstructive) conduct of the Houssa Police stationed at Prashu"" has not been mentioned by our correspondents in their letters, we may infer that these violent Mahomedans, of which that Police is composed, are far from allowing themselves to be restrained by that discipline without which every armed force must be at the same time a nuisance and a danger. Even supposing, therefore—which we should be sorry indeed to feel justified in doing—that, as between these Mahomedan aliens and native Christians, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor of the Gold Coast are without preference, we think it would be their duty to organize a force of those Christian men who, by the testimony of Sir John Glover, can be in every way depended upon, rather than to retain the perilous service of these Mahomedans, concerning whom there has been no lack of testimony that, however brave and valuable in campaign, they are not to be depended upon for good conduct in their relations with the civil community in time of peace. This question of the future Armed Police on the Gold Coast is a very serious one. For carrying out the great objects without which the Gold Coast cannot advance in wealth and civilization, it is necessary that the public revenue should be a large one, and constantly increasing. That it may be so, there must be an entire security in the passage of traders between the sea-coast ports and the interior. For this the Armed Police Force, to whom the guarding the frontier and maintaining perfect security on the roads is committed, must be an obedient and dependable one. The Houssa Police Force has not established for itself any such character. A substitute for it must therefore be found. There are Christian natives who, by proper inducement and treatment, might be made available. Are we not justified, therefore, in saying that a grave responsibility will rest on those who have power in this matter if they decline to avail themselves of this obedient and dependable element of public order, and rest on the ""broken reed"" of fanatic Mahomedans.'}, {'id': 2928, 'article_title': 'A Military Officer Punished', 'full_section_title': 'A Military Officer Punished', 'last_edit_date': '07-19-1875', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_09_1875', 'content': ""Such is our correspondent's letter; and is it not grievous to think that of such officers as this —— civil commandants are made on the West Coast?

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence.

The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

He was ordered by Mr. O'Callaghan, the magistrate before whom he was brought up, to be flogged, and the punishment was inflicted publicly outside the gates of the castle. In the evening the men assembled and marched out of the castle with their band, and went to a place called Napoleon, five miles distant from here, and situated in the bush. The Government here (so called out of courtesy), consisting of three or four gentlemen, were exceedingly alarmed.

All this, and a great deal more, seems, however, to be threatened, through that long indecision, that long delay in arriving at a wise decision, on the part of Earl Kimberley, of which we have ventured to complain. The existing danger is not a danger arising from any present military superiority of the Ashantis over the people of the Protected Territories. Under the, for a long time, efficacious protection of Great Britain, the population of those territories has so greatly increased since the time of the old Ashanti triumphs above alluded to, that we do not hesitate to say they are fully capable of their own protection and defence against Ashanti, if permitted to organize and act in their own way, and furnished with those supplies of arms and ammunition and other sinews of war, which it is the indisputable duty of the British Government, as the sole recipients of the customs revenues (the only revenues) to place at their disposal. And here the complete organization for defence against Ashanti, as projected and arranged by the Fanti Confederation, comes naturally before us once again for recommendation and insistence with Her Majesty's Government. Under actual British West African policy, as inaugurated after the decision of the House of Commons' Committee in 1865, such confederation, whether for eventual good (as we believe) or eventual evil, has become an absolute necessity of the position.

After the ill-blown and disastrous Ashanti war bubble, which led to the sitting of the aforesaid Parliamentary Committee, the people of the Protected Territories were informed by the British authorities that in the future they must depend entirely on themselves as against Ashanti. Some arms and ammunition might be served out to them, and a British officer or two be lent to them - but nothing more. From that time the Home Government set resolutely to work to reduce the military expenditure on the West Coast. What remains for now some time past at Cape Coast and Accra, is nothing more than a mere guard for the sacred persons of the British authorities, and for the British flag which floats there. While thus, however, repudiating all obligation to defend, and withdrawing all their means for defending, they kept and keep within their own hand all power to direct the policy and negotiations of the territories as regards Ashanti; and as regarded the habitual allies of the Ashantis, the Dutch; as well as the whole public revenue of the country. Hence the treaty with Holland for exchange of territories, which, most unwisely, handed over towns to the Dutch without the consent of the people; and whole provinces which we had no power whatever to give, much less any shadow of right to give; and which opened to the traditional Ashanti enemy constant access to Elmina and other then Dutch coast towns. The kings, chiefs, and people saw the injustice and the danger, and met it boldly. Combined native forces assembled for operations against the Dutch. These operations led eventually to the sale by the Dutch of all their Gold Coast possessions to Great Britain. The assemblage of those combined native forces had in it the fruitful and vigorous germ of the Fanti Confederation, which became an acknowledged and influential fact during their progress. We have before claimed, and we claim again, for that Confederation the great victory of the entire withdrawal of the Dutch from the West Coast. Meanwhile the Ashantis—as the fruit of what ought to have been nipped in the bud at Addah by the British authorities at Cape Coast if they had been worth their salt as rulers—had laid waste whole districts in the extreme east of the territories, destroyed the cotton plantations and the people of Krepee, and committed all those other horrible excesses which uniformly attend their invasions. Was it likely, was it reasonable, that the kings and chiefs, alive to their constant peril on the side of Ashanti—long since forewarned that they must provide for their own defence; and seeing the Coast quite denuded (so far as regards all practical purposes connected with internal policy) of British troops—should dissolve their infant but provedly effective union, which had only been effected at the price of many mutual concessions; fold their arms in apathetic resignation, and deliver their throats to the Ashanti knife? It was neither likely, nor reasonable. What was likely and reasonable was, that they should endeavour to cement and extend their union; that they should organize it for internal administration and defence, under the friendly care of the British Government. They did this. The British authorities had often shown them that, before they could be regarded as a real organization, they must form something of a constitution, setting forth their objects, aims, and proposed means of action. This they did also. They met at Mankessim, joined and assisted by educated natives. They drafted and signed a Constitution, appointed officers, sent some of these latter, with the said Constitution, to be submitted to the British Coast authorities and the Colonial authorities at home, for their examination and approval. Then burst the storm. The Acting Administrator, Mr. Salmon, received the Fanti Confederation officials with a burst of ungovernable fury; refused to take and transmit the documents, charged the bearing officials with high treason, arrested and imprisoned them. He made the British Government to be like the dog in the manger—unable and unwilling to govern and defend the interior provinces, but at the same time determined that the Fanti Confederation, which could, and offered to do this, should not do it either. We do not intend here to re-state the persecutions and prosecutions which resulted from this dog-in-the-manger policy of an Administrator who was clearly unfit for the office he then filled, under circumstances that demanded a wise and prudent course of conduct. Immediately the atrocious folly came to our knowledge, we supplied Earl Kimberley with a copy of the Fanti Constitution, and detail of what had taken place, referring the whole matter to his consideration, and praying a speedy decision. Hitherto no such decision has been communicated. The territories remain without any effective native organization for their defence. The kings of some of the frontier provinces have therefore acted according to their own will. Hence the detention by them of the Ashanti chieftain, whose cruelties at Elmina and elsewhere had made him very odious to them; and, as a further consequence, the reported Ashanti inroad, with its usual atrocities and horrors. Both these are the direct results of the non-adoption of the Fanti Confederation by Earl Kimberley; while he has been at the same time carrying out the economic Government policy of the withdrawal of troops from the Coast. Had the Fanti Confederation been thus adopted, and its organization and action been approved and regulated by the British Government, the Confederation would have acted in accord with the British authorities as to the return of the Ashanti captain to his country. He would not have been detained as he has been, to the disgrace of the British authorities and the anger of the King of Ashanti. Nor this alone; but in addition, it is beyond doubt that the King of Ashanti would never have ventured an inroad into the Fanti countries had their organization for defence been approved and perfected. The so-called Protected Territories could only be a prey for the Ashantis when there existed division among their kings and chiefs, or some mere temporary rope of sand their union, ready to fall in pieces at the Ashanti touch. United, as they have sought to unite themselves, for general policy and combined action, with the assent of the British Government, they would be a power with which Ashanti could not cope. Unless the British Government has entirely changed its policy, and intends to undertake the military defence of the Protected Territories and their permanent internal administration, in defiance of the Parliamentary recommendation, it is imperatively called upon, by"", 'last_edit_date': '1873-01-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_01_1873#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Condition of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter appeared in a recent number of the *Globe*:\n\nSir,—As you have before now placed the Gold Coast Colony under obligation by bestowing some attention upon that God-forgotten place, I hope you will find room to publish the following extract from the *Western Echo*, published at Cape Coast, and dated November 18, 1885. It may be of interest to your readers as showing what things are frequently occurring in a British colony which extends nowhere more than 80 miles back from the sea, and which has a Governor with £3,500 a year, a secretary, and four assistant secretaries, to govern less than half a million people, living in a country of only 12,000 square miles:—\n\n""The Accrofuls and Puttooboos, who have always been creating disturbances in their district, had recently a quarrel, which terminated in a fight. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, the Puttooboos caught a native of Accroful, and this man, it is reported, they cruelly treated. They first took him and put him to death. This done, they surrounded the body with knives and cut it into small pieces, scattering the latter subsequently in various parts of their town, and taking the blood of the poor man and sprinkling it over their fetish. The Puttooboos, bent still on mischief, it is reported, then prepared their arms, and marched towards Accroful. Evidently the action of the Puttooboos was the outcome of certain ill-will which they bore towards the Accrofuls, and which, it is believed, was partially occasioned by the action of either the one or the other with respect to flags. Company fights are generally brought about by demonstrations with flags, and it is, perhaps, superfluous to add that those between villages or towns may often trace their origin to the very same source. The Accrofuls, it is stated, were suddenly surprised by the arrival in their village of an armed band of Puttooboos, who, on nearing the village, and seeing people, fired on them. From this account, it would appear that the Puttooboos were in Accroful before the Accrofuls could know that one of their natives had been killed and cut to pieces. The work of arming for a contest did not, however, occupy many minutes, and before the Puttooboos could believe it, their opponents were ready for them. Each party must then have retired to a spot close by, and there butchered one another. The fight commenced at 6 a.m., and lasted till 2 p.m., several being killed and wounded. Meanwhile news of the disturbance reached Cape Coast, and Captain Stewart, the District Commissioner, left with a party of armed police for the scene of hostilities. But the fighting was over. The combatants had scattered. Some Houssas, too, arrived on the scene from Elmina. The District Commissioner only succeeded in bringing to Cape Coast four natives of Puttooboo as prisoners.

Outside of this, the mass of the people are obliged to fetch home drinking water from distances varying between four and ten miles, excepting such of those who, from want of time, convenience, or health, or from infirmity or other indispositions, are obliged to content themselves with brackish water drawn from stone quarries, or such classes of impure and almost poisonous water as they could secure from the many stagnant ponds and pools of the settlement, and which the medical authorities of the colony would readily admit are worse than useless for purposes of drinking and cooking, and barely of little value for ablution. About an average of seven miles from each port, all along the sea-coast, are streams and springs waters; these can easily be led into each seaport town by the ordinary drain-pipes, at no considerable cost to the Government, and thus provide good drinking and ablution water for all classes throughout the sea-coast portion of the settlement, as is done in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.\n155\n\nHer Majesty’s dominions.

It indicates that Her Majesty's Government have entirely abandoned the do-nothing or surrender policy which was so disgraceful to Great Britain, and so unjust and destructive to the protected territories; that they feel and admit their obligations as regards those territories, and are determined to vindicate British honour and Gold Coast security, against the cruel and treacherous enemy who has been so disgracefully permitted to push his devastating hordes to within cannon-shot of Cape Coast and Elmina. Sir Garnet Wolseley has a reputation for dash, daring and persistence, which induces us to think him a fit person to be at the helm of affairs on the Gold Coast at this period, when the evils which have flooded in, because of Colonel Harley's fatal incapacity, demand the presence of a man of action for their removal. It must not, however, be supposed that in condemning Colonel Harley we exonerate Her Majesty's Government. They appointed him, and they sustained him against an overwhelming evidence of events which convinced every one but themselves; and now they will have to draw largely on Imperial revenues to undo the mischief which their protégé has permitted to run riot in the countries placed under his care. We look upon this, however, only as a just retribution. The British Government would not do anything for those countries which Divine Providence had given into their hands. They withdrew their troops, yet would not allow the natives to confederate and organize for the defence of the countries which they stated they would themselves no longer defend. They would not surrender for the organization of a local force, any portion of the large revenues they were levying on the trade of the country. They ignored the wealth and importance of territories, second to none in the world if the ordinary appliances of civilization had been introduced there. And now, through the acts of their own servants, without any fault on the part of the unfortunate natives, they have been placed in a position with regard to those territories which exacts from them, in vindication of their national honour, pecuniary and other sacrifices tenfold greater than would have been needed for the performance of the duties they have sinfully neglected. We say sinfully, for God does not entrust power to such a country as Great Britain to be used by her as the talent was by the man mentioned in one of the parables of our Divine Redeemer. She has neglected her duty; and now God, by His overruling of human actions and events, forces her to perform it in the very way she would least of all have desired. We cannot enter in this number upon the consideration of all that is involved in, and that must result from, the new course of action to which Great Britain is thus impelled. We may possibly do so in our next. We foresee changes that our heart has long desired; but we only now express the hope that Sir Garnet Wolseley, Captain Glover, and others now selected for active operations, may prove to be the men who will be permitted to effect them. Coomassie must be occupied, and the great problem of what lies beyond Coomassie be at last solved. The everlasting Gospel must be preached, in that direction, beyond the limits which, hitherto impenetrable, Ashanti has imposed; and we feel that the time has come.

The exclusive intelligence to be found in our columns will well repay perusal. We fear there is no doubt of an Ashantee war. Imperfect as our system (if it merit the name of a system) on the Gold Coast is, the comparative security of life there has long been gradually draining Ashantee of a portion of its population. Slaves seek refuge there, rather than be slaughtered and buried in a dead chief's grave. Is any chief or headman summoned to Comassie in a manner that causes him to dread a fatal termination to his journey, he prefers to migrate to the protected territories with his willing followers. If the British Government had fully comprehended its inevitable mission on the Gold Coast, the active influences of civilization would long ere this have penetrated Ashantee, and such a war as is now imminent, or actually commenced, would have been impossible. Had there been roads from the coast to the Ashantee frontier, every police post at their terminus would have been a radiating centre of civilising influences. We think that on the first symptoms of approaching trouble with Ashantee, the Gold Coast authorities ought to have called upon the chiefs to open up military paths, if not roads, through their districts. Now we suppose every man is engaged as a soldier. The people have to defend their homes. But when this war shall have finished, roads must be made, and such changes as may be requisite in the character of our occupation there in order to enable this to be effected must be ordered. A wave of civilization must have way made for it to roll on from the seacoast to the Kong Mountains. We are sorry not to have heard of any proclamation forbidding the Fantees and other people of the protected territories to slaughter and decapitate their prisoners. It is not creditable to us that it should be thought pleasant to our authorities on the coast to have human heads sent to them. We are in Africa to civilise, and to countenance barbarous practices is not the way to civilise. Again, if the quarrel proceed to full and widespread hostilities, we hope the small British force there will be under good leadership. We confess to great misgivings on this point. The state of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps does not inspire us with any confidence in those who have allowed that formerly fine, well-behaved body of men to lose all discipline and subordination.

Colonel Conran, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast, and in this capacity resident at Cape Coast Castle, has up to the present time justified the hopes we had formed, the expectations we entertained of him. Only a few days after his arrival he called together the native authorities of the town, which is situate under the guns of Cape Coast Castle, and laid before them his plans and suggestions for the removal of nuisances and abuses which preceding Governors had tolerated, but which, unremoved and unremedied, were effectual barriers to all progress in the material evidences of civilisation. And without the material evidences of civilisation, no real progress of civilisation is possible. We refer our readers to Governor Conran's address to the King and chiefs, and other native authorities. We like to get our justification from time to time by official documents. This of Governor Conran's is an important one for us. It gives such a catalogue of official British neglect that we can point to it with confidence and say, have we exaggerated the evil state of affairs at Cape Coast? have we unjustly charged British authorities and officials with attending only to their own private interests, and, but too often, most immoral pursuits, and neglecting all that could really promote the well-being of a people who require to be taught even the very first steps in the great onward march of progressive civilisation? The streets impassable, because so encumbered with putrifying animal filth and decomposed vegetable matter!—every house a graveyard!—no proper supply of water!—no observance of the Christian Sabbath! We refrain from giving the whole catalogue. It is a damning one to successive batches of past officials, and to some present ones; and we thank Colonel and Governor Conran from our hearts for his so speedy and vigorous effort for the real material good of the population at large, and for the health of Europeans and others whose duties entail upon them the necessity of residence in Cape Coast Town or Castle. And we thank him the more heartily because we feel deeply for him in the trying position in which he has been placed by events so unexpected when he was addressing the native authorities. The conflict which has taken place between the West India soldiers of the garrison and the natives was a most unhappy commentary on the very humane and proper caution given by the Governor to the native authorities with regard to those culpable excesses which too generally attend the noisy, riotous heathen festivals. The Governor threatened the extremest penalties of the law— the British law—should lives be lost in any party fight among the natives; and lo, instead of such party fights the soldiers of the garrison ran riot in the town, killed two or three people, and gravely wounded some sixty others. The good discipline of the troops under Colonel Conran had during the past twelve months been the constant theme of letters from Cape Coast. But it seems as if during the Colonel's absence in England to give evidence before the Parliamentary Committee discipline had been relaxed, and the result is of course that which always occurs in such cases—deplorable excesses, which must necessarily entail punishment on the offenders, and subject the whole corps to restrictions, painful for the commander to order, and for the men to endure. We do not think it necessary to make any further remarks at present on this painful subject, as we have the fullest confidence that Colonel Conran, Lieut.-Governor and Commander-in-Chief on the Gold Coast, will do all that is necessary for the enforcement of proper discipline, and that justice to the injured and to the relatives of the slain can properly demand.

The textbook highlights the construction of railways and roads, such as the first railway in British West Africa built in Sierra Leone during the 1890s, which facilitated the evacuation of exports and supported military and administrative functions. This infrastructure development, coupled with the British government's recognition of the economic potential of their colonies, as articulated by Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, underscores the strategic economic involvement in the region. However, the textbook does not specifically mention Cape Coast in the context of military and administrative infrastructure, nor does it explicitly link these activities to a broader military strategy involving reinforcements. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize the military infrastructure, noting the presence of Her Majesty's ships, troop deployments, and reinforcements from Sierra Leone and the Gambia, highlighting the military strategy in the region. The articles also detail the Governor's organization of native forces and the use of Gatling guns at Cape Coast Castle, underscoring military preparedness. Additionally, they discuss administrative infrastructure, including the Governor's role in organizing forces and settling disputes, and economic involvement through trade, banking, and exports like palm oil and gold dust. Despite these strategic elements, the articles also mention challenges such as health issues and competition from other European powers, adding complexity to the narrative of British colonial administration and strategy.

These details align with the claim that British colonial activities in West Africa were strategically significant due to their military and administrative infrastructure, supported by reinforcements and economic involvement.

The construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and harbours received the attention of the colonial administrations quite early on. Though these facilities helped in the general administration, their main task was to evacuate exports. No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)\nMost of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies. Construction of the first railway in British West Africa took place in Sierra Leone during the 1890s. The first train started operating in the colony area in 1897, and by 1909 the main line, crossing the rich palm oil belt to Pendembu, in the east (365 km) had been completed. A branch line from Bubuyan to Makeni in the north (132 km) was opened in 1915. Soon after the work started in Sierra Leone, other dependencies followed her example with even better results. All major lines were built by 1920.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887.

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting. The colonized peoples had to raise revenue for the general administration and for whatever limited development projects that were undertaken.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'During the period 1880 to 1914, the whole of West Africa, with the sole exception of Liberia (see Chapter 2), was brought under colonial rule. This phenomenon which meant essentially the loss of African sovereignty and independence as well as land, was accomplished in two phases. The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans. It should be emphasized that these reactions were very much determined by the local African situation. Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans. This was the classical era of treaty-making in practically every nook and corner of West Africa followed in most cases by military invasions, conquests and occupation by armies of varying sizes and discipline. The period from 1880 to 1900 was the high-water mark of European conquest and occupation of West Africa. Never in the known history of the continent has so much military action been seen and so many invasions and campaigns launched against African states and communities (see Fig. 6.1). Particularly memorable were the French campaigns in the Western Sudan, Ivory Coast and Dahomey (now Benin) between 1880 and 1898, and the British campaigns in Asante (in what is now Ghana), the Niger Delta region (Nigeria) and in Northern Nigeria between 1895 and 1903 (see Fig. 6.2).', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Indeed, the colonial powers went out of their way to promote and encourage the adoption of modern money in three main ways. These, according to Hopkins, were 'by demonetising traditional currencies; by paying [the] expanding labour force in European coin; and by insisting on receiving taxes in cash rather than in kind'. 67 These methods proved very successful and by 1910 European currencies were widespread in West Africa. In the British colonies these consisted of a wide variety of English coins. In 1912, the West African Currency Board was established to supply currencies to British West Africa. In 1913, the Board issued its first coins of the denominations of 2s, is, 6d and 3d and three years later its first currency notes. In British East Africa, the British at first introduced the currency system operating in British India. In 1920, however, one currency board was established to issue coins and notes for the three colonies. It should be noted that all these currencies were linked with sterling in London.\nOne important consequence of the increasing use of currencies was the introduction of banking institutions in British Africa. In West Africa the first bank to start operations was the Bank of British West Africa in 1894, followed in 1926 by Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century. As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.728, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Southern Africa', 'section_title': 'Models of African initiatives and reactions', 'content': ""War-weariness and insecurity contributed greatly to the acceptance of British wardship or alliance on the part of several African polities and individuals.

George Blankson, J.P., was made field-marshal, and his son his aide-de-camp.\n\nWith one of the captives at Bobeecomah General Owoosookookoo sent a symbolical message to the Governor—two sticks, one short and the other long, requesting him to choose one. The meaning is, that if the Governor was in favour of the early termination of the war, he was to take the short one, and give up Ajaman, dead or alive; but should he take the long one, he (Owoosookookoo) would continue the war for the next three years, amidst all difficulties. The Governor, with his brilliant staff, moved to the field, and took his quarters at Denkara, a few hours from the Ajimacoo's camp. He retained the *long stick*, and sent Prince Osoo Ansah, one of the hostages of the last war, and brother to Owoosookookoo, to inform him that he will not open a negotiation with him unless he sends a chief or captain of importance, and that he retains the *long stick*, and would fight with the Ashantees for the next seven years, until the kingdom of Ashantee will come to obedience with the English Government. Meanwhile, he properly organised the native forces, compelled those who had retired from the field to rejoin the camp, settled all disputes and differences amongst them, and inspired new spirit in them. And after a consultation between him and Major Cochrane, they agreed that, should the Ashantees not come to their terms, a simultaneous attack should be made with the regular forces and the native armies—numbering at least about 25,000 men—against the Ashantee force in Soedrue, and either gain a complete victory over them, or compel them to retire from our territory. Owoosookookoo has received the Governor's message, and is still refractory; but he has sent up to communicate with the King. Already the Governor has given orders to the native force to be ready to advance at a moment's notice, and I hope by the next mail I shall be able to communicate something definite to you.\n\nThe Governor had given a commission, as captain of Volunteers, to Mr. Charles Finlason, who has raised a corps of Volunteers and organised them at his own sole charge. The Governor honoured this corps under Captain Finlason by accepting them as his bodyguard and escort.\n\nEnsign Brien, of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps, has died of dysentery. There are strong complaints of cruel neglect in his case on the part of the medical officers.

I was not disappointed in my anticipation of an entertaining and instructive visit; but I must confess that I was surprised to find that Sierra Leone possesses the claim it does to natural beauty. I had heard and read so much of its unhealthiness that I had pictured to myself a low-lying swampy coast, fringed with mangrove bushes, and with the other accompaniments of a malarial climate. This imaginary sketch bore not the slightest resemblance to the truth. In the place of a flat, low-lying district I found a mountainous tract of country, formed by two rivers which nearly intersect it. The general appearance of this Sierra is picturesque in the extreme. The sky line is broken by the irregular outline of a number of conical peaks, covered to their summits with lofty forests, which give to the distant scenery a rich and romantic appearance. Freetown is situated on the shore of a beautiful bay, hemmed in by a grand amphitheatre of hills, covered with vegetation. The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone. The colony is garrisoned by half a West India Regiment, and a considerable naval force is maintained on the coast to protect British interests.""}, {'id': 6675, 'article_title': 'LIST OF PASSENGERS', 'full_section_title': 'LIST OF PASSENGERS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-13', 'issue_date': '02_12_1895', 'content': ""*Per ss.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.731, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIR G. BADEN-POWELL ON WEST AFRICA AND ITS TRADE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir George Baden-Powell said he went to West Africa with the pre-conceived wish that he should know the true state of affairs in every portion of the British Empire. He knew that a great many of his constituents were connected with the West African trade, and that he should be doing a service to his constituents and to Liverpool if he visited the West Coast and returned to Parliament as a man who could say to those who were treating them wrongly that such was the case, and that he knew it. He could not on the present occasion go thoroughly into such a great subject, but they would expect him to indicate some of the chief results of the inquiries which he made. He wanted, in the first place, to find out how the West African settlements were governed. He did not think the people of England understood the magnitude of the trade with that coast. The figures show that during the past ten or fifteen years their trade with the West Indies had fallen to £6,000,000, while that with West Africa had risen from £1,500,000 to £5,000,000. He had looked round on these colonies, and he felt that they should not give up any one of them, but that they should try to acquire others. He had been to the Gambia, and he found the general talk was that the Gambia must fall into the hands of the French. It seemed to him that the Gambia was a most valuable possession on the Coast. He also went to Sierra Leone, which was the only harbour on the Coast available for ocean-going ships, with the exception of Decka and the Isles de Los. He need not mention the great importance these places were to British trade. With regard to the Natives he was surprised to find so much prosperity, so much vigour, and so much inclination to follow agriculture and the productive arts. He imagined that the Natives would have been hardly worthy of notice, but he had come away with the very opposite feelings. In his opinion these Natives were worthy of the highest attention, and might be cultivated and improved to a high degree. He wished this country would notice the widespread existence of slavery on the West Coast, but with a view of substituting for it that civilisation with which that country would be blessed. Twenty years ago England seemed paramount in that part of Africa; but the French and Germans soon after that became competitors on the West Coast of Africa. He thought they got along with the Germans pretty well now, because they endeavoured to co-operate with our traders in the matter of Customs duties, &c. Of the French he feared they could not say that. They had started with the grand idea of founding a French African empire and to break up the Native opposition, but in no case had they endeavoured to set up any form of commercial basis for their expeditions or colonies. The Portuguese could hardly be described as having more than a foothold on the coast; and the same might be said of the Republic of Liberia. Dealing with the Government of the West Coast of Africa, the general policy of every Government was so changeable that foreign nations did not know precisely what the British Government were driving at. He did not think the English people appreciated the great extent of territory and the large population which had been placed under the British flag. There were large areas which British traders did not penetrate, but they might at once bring all these areas under the control of their trade, and those who wished to invest capital should not fail to seize upon such opening. People might ask how was it to be done. To his mind the matter was simplicity itself. They wanted to put a little more brain power into the work. He had himself urged upon the Government the advantage of establishing proper administration over the Native districts; he had to do it in what was known as North Bechuanaland. He had studied the projects for railways in Africa, and he had also inspected the only railway in tropical Africa, from Decka to San Louis, 150 miles long. It was made by the French, and although it was managed on a wrong financial principle, it had opened up a large tract of country, and was bringing down an unexpected amount of produce. He was convinced that two, three, or four railways could be built into the interior, and would certainly largely increase the trade of West Africa. There was another matter too large to be touched upon. The revenue was derived from Customs duties on imports and exports. This was a matter which was international, and should be taken up by all the nations having interests on the West Coast. They should fix the duties on the same basis throughout West Africa, because they wanted the Trade to go down by the easiest route. Again, there should be some means of promotion amongst the officials. They should make one big civil service, at least including the West Indies and the West Coast, so that they would have good men able for the work ready to fill any vacancy that might occur. He took an intelligent view of the subject, not because he had acquired much information on one short visit, but because it had given him the opportunity of gleaning from the fertile brains of many of the best merchants on the coast. There was another matter he wished to deal with, and that was the question of the coaling stations. At the present moment they had no place where British warships could coal and repair between Devonport and Cape Town, a distance of 6,000 miles. There were only four ports all down the West Coast available for large vessels, and three of them were British. One was Decka, which the French had made as strong a port as they could, with water boats and every facility. The others were Bathurst, Isles do Los, and Sierra Leone. The British Government had done nothing to make these ports available for coaling, or for watering, &c. In regard to the troubles on the Brass river, a full inquiry would be made into the matter. This inquiry should be thorough, and he believed it would bring about some assimilation of these Customs duties he had spoken about. He would not fail to try to press this matter of duties as far as Parliament had power to do so. They would say that his views of West African affairs were very sanguine. As he had said, he looked for a great development of trade if a strong administration was established and if the Government properly supported the merchants and traders. Trade would also do good for the Natives, and tend to wipe out the stain of the miseries of the slave-trade, which they were the people to initiate.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-03-22', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_05_1895#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

He reminded his hearers that England once had a free hand, and did not profit by her opportunities. The Gambia is among the oldest English colonies. It commands the mouth of a navigable waterway, along which England's authority might have spread over the whole interior. From want of energy France has been allowed to take the upper waters under its protection; and the result is that the Gambia colony has to be described as small and retrograding. Not much better things can be said of the settlement of Sierra Leone. Its confines might have been expanded to take in the Upper Niger, which has its sources not far from the Sierra Leone boundary. At one time it was practicable to conciliate the friendship of the Mahommedan chief, Samadu, who has been building up an empire inland. The chance was postponed, and now Samadu has placed his kingdom under the protection of France. The colony of Lagos is the sole plantation at which Mr. Johnston can glance without vexation. There, though the Government delays to move the front of the harbour, and though official supineness is answerable for the interposition of wedges of foreign territory between Lagos and the Gold Coast, the spirit of English enterprise is seen. Trade has advanced by leaps and bounds. The settlement in its first year, 1862-3, counted it as £329,479; and in 1887 it was £906,812. He would hesitate to put limits to the prosperity and importance of the place. Yet nothing has been effected at Lagos which could not have been accomplished in Gambia and Sierra Leone. The blame for the shortcomings to be discovered in British West Africa he does not attribute to British traders. The community engaged in conducting mercantile undertakings in West Africa he characterises as a set of genial, good-hearted Englishmen, sagacious and just in their dealings. Of the officials he also speaks in complimentary language. British West Africa has ceased to be a refuge for ruined spendthrifts, of whom their families rejoiced to rid themselves. West African Governors of the present type instruct the natives in the vegetable riches of their own land, and the acclimatisation of useful foreign plants, and they cultivate a fashion among their staffs of learning the native languages. In the past the lethargy which kept British West Africa back, and invited European competition, was universal.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

As it is, a work of great importance has just been concluded in the interests of England. The encroachments of the French on our West African sphere are well known to those who have been watching events in that part of the world. Their evident aim was so to surround our four little colonies as to shut them out completely from the interior, and ruin them so far as their trade goes. Fortunately, H.E. Alfred Moloney, Governor of Lagos, saw clearly what the policy of the French was, and from his knowledge of the country and people was able to take steps to preserve for Lagos a free route to the interior and the commerce of the native markets, and to bring a large and valuable country within the sphere of British influence. Practically the whole of the fine Yoruba country has been attached and free access obtained to and beyond the Kong Mountains, and to the sphere of the Royal Niger Company. Governor Moloney deserves to be congratulated on having accomplished this delicate task.\n\nHis report on Lagos for 1888, just issued, is voluminous and abounds in information as to the condition of the colony. He begins with a useful comparative statement of the tariffs of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gold Coast, Lagos, the intervening French and German possessions, and the Royal Niger Territory. Lagos was acquired by treaty in 1861, and the report embodies figures showing its growth since. The revenue for 1887 came to £51,347, while the expenditure reached...\n163\n\n£78,610.

Every year the missionary schools discharge a number of educated men and women who almost invariably embark in trade. Most of them have some small capital, which they use to trade with the interior natives, and the produce they thus obtain they either ship on consignment to England, to obtain the proceeds in British and other goods and silver coin, or sell it to the large British and foreign mercantile houses on the Coast, receiving goods from them in exchange for a renewal of operations with the producers in the interior. These native traders almost universally prefer to remit their produce to Europe for sale; but in this they labour under the great disadvantage of having their capital locked up until they obtain from Europe the proceeds of the sales, in goods or money.

A bank, moreover, that is capable of offering ample guarantees for the safety of moneys deposited with it, cannot fail of being highly useful to the public service as bankers to the several Administrations, receiving from the Colonial Treasurers the proceeds of the Customs' duties and other sources of revenue, and holding them at the disposal of the Government in the shape most convenient to the latter. Such a bank will link West Africa, now isolated, with the great financial system of the civilized world, giving her a recognized position therein—a fact of enormous importance for the British West African Settlements, when we consider that almost everything that can be accomplished by capital has yet to be effected there. All the aids and appliances of civilization for facilitating communications between the Coast and the interior, for economizing labour, for the transport of goods and produce, and for the development of the abounding natural and mineral resources, have yet to be introduced; and a well-established bank, giving large dividends to its shareholders, will show European capital the way to further profitable investment in those too long neglected countries. We have always steadfastly maintained that ere many years the West Africa Settlements will take rank among the most valuable colonial possessions of Great Britain, and every fresh step towards the realization of this prediction is to us a source of real delight. The bank is such a step, and we shall welcome it with all our heart. We can assure it, too, a welcome all along the West Coast, to which it cannot fail to prove a benefactor. Our only regret at this moment is, that it will not be brought before the public in time for us to advertise it more fully in this number of our journal. But we have sounded the note of preparation, and our readers may confidently await its beneficial advent."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Influence on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter has been addressed recently to Earl Granville by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the African Trade Section of that Chamber:—\n\n""My Lord,—I am requested by the Council of this Chamber to ask that your serious consideration may be given to the following facts, many of which are doubtless well known to you, but which have a special significance owing to the position of matters in West Africa at the present time. The British protectorate, as you are aware, is extended over a large portion of the Coast of Africa, which stretches from the settlement of Sierra Leone to the district of the Niger. Upon this coast, excluding the State of Liberia and the neighbourhood of Whydah, the port of Dahomey, there are three French settlements—viz., Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Porto Novo; also portions of coast unprotected by any European Power. West of Grand Bassam there is unoccupied coast of considerable extent; east of Lagos, beyond Leckie, and reaching to Old Calabar, there is the important territory at the mouths of the Niger. Quite recently the Germans have taken certain ports on this coast—viz., Ahgweh, Bageida, and Little Popo. At these there was a thriving and increasing British trade, and with the chiefs of Ahgweh and Little Popo treaties had been made on behalf of Her Majesty, securing the right of British subjects to trade on equal terms with those of any other nation. The occupation by France and the late annexations by Germany break the continuity of the British protectorate; there is an increasing conflict of the various national interests, and the influence of the British authorities with the natives is being lessened; the introduction of different principles of trading will also seriously affect the prosperity of British commerce. It is important to mention in this connexion that the duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnish the greater portion of the Government revenue. In German and French settlements these articles are known, in most cases, to be free of duty, and being sold to a great extent in the same markets as the British imports, competition becomes difficult, and the loss to the British revenue and trade must ultimately be great. The Chamber would suggest, therefore, that while negotiations regarding African territories are pending, something might be done in the way of exchange or by mutual concession to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from those newly acquired ports where British trade had become established, and where German rivalry upon different principles is likely to be so injurious. This Government might also be requested to take into consideration the question of the extension of the British protectorate to the unprotected portion of the coast named.—I am, &c.,\n\n""C. B.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way.

Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious.

There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

Here the main trends of the nineteenth century were the training and increasing professionalism and subsequent introduction of European armaments to this infantry. In the widespread movement of peoples, such as followed the Mfecane or the collapse of the Old Oyo empire, sometimes a people in a scrubland area hitherto depending on cavalry moved into a more forested area where cavalry warfare was difficult, and this further encouraged the decline of cavalries. Some of the states in direct confrontation with European settlers, having a tradition of mounted riflemen, bred ponies for fast movement, organized importation of European arms and created new armies that for a while had the balance of power on their side. In much of the rest of Africa and especially the Sudan, where for centuries the cavalry had been the core and the elite of the armies, trained, professional foot soldiers armed with rifles rose to become the elite force.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Raising the levies depended on the political acumen of the ruler and he could rarely claim a monopoly of that.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval.

Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Notable examples of this tendency were the initial impact of the Mfecane, and the impact of trade and the Chokwe and Ovimbundu expansion on the Luba and Lunda state systems.$^{4}$ Several states and empires disappeared. And yet even more noticeable were the many new centres of power that emerged, experimenting with new administrative structures, generally tending towards a more effective exercise of power by the ruler, clearer definition of his jurisdiction, greater control of officials who owed their positions to his favour rather than their own hereditary rights, improved tax systems and the like. 5\nSome historians have described these reformist movements as the activi› ties of African 'proto-nationalists and empire builders' engaged in a kind of African Scramble which in part provoked, or at least helps to explain, the European Scramble.$^{6}$ In fact, these reformist activities were not a sudden or fitful movement in any way comparable with the European Scramble. The search for more stable political structures had been going on throughout the nineteenth century and indeed before then as part of the general evolution of the peoples. Perhaps there was a quickening of the pace, and changes hitherto associated with the rise of states like Old Oyo in the seventeenth century or Asante, Dahomey, Futa Jallon, Futa Toro and Bondu in the eighteenth century became more general in the nineteenth century.

This is not a distinction between 'state' and 'stateless' societies as anthropologists have earlier suggested. In Bunafu, not only was there a sense of government and authority, some of the migrants came with traditions of structured hierarchical political systems from which they were fleeing, but which they still drew upon in the rivalries that accompanied the emergence of a new authority system in Bunafu. Others also carried with them belief in the power of a the mukama, a charismatic prince chosen and possessed by the god, or the efficacy of ritual firelighting from royal hearths, to affect fertility and harvests. As Vellut has argued, instead of the state-stateless dichotomy, we should think of two modes of power structures: the hierarchical, well-defined order based on the payment of tribute which was that of the kingdoms; and, at the other extreme, the more egalitarian and informal type of government by councils of elders and notables."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': 'The second positive political impact is the very geo-political appearance of the modern independent states of Africa.

In place of the hundreds of independent clan and lineage groups, city-states, king› doms and empires, without any clearly marked boundaries, were now established fifty new states with, in most cases, fixed boundaries, and it is rather significant that the boundaries of the states as laid down during the colonial era have not undergone any changes since independence.\nThirdly, the colonial system also introduced into most parts of Africa two new institutions which again rather significantly have been maintained since independence, namely, a new judicial system and a new bureaucracy or civil service. There is no doubt that in practically all the independent states except the Muslim ones, the higher courts of judicature introduced by the colonial rulers have been retained; in the former British colonies not only in form (including, despite the climate, even the wigs and gowns), but also in content and ethos.\nThe machineries introduced for the administration of the colonies also steadily led, though in many areas rather belatedly, to the emergence of a civil service whose membership and influence increased with the years.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

George Blankson, J.P., was made field-marshal, and his son his aide-de-camp.\n\nWith one of the captives at Bobeecomah General Owoosookookoo sent a symbolical message to the Governor—two sticks, one short and the other long, requesting him to choose one. The meaning is, that if the Governor was in favour of the early termination of the war, he was to take the short one, and give up Ajaman, dead or alive; but should he take the long one, he (Owoosookookoo) would continue the war for the next three years, amidst all difficulties. The Governor, with his brilliant staff, moved to the field, and took his quarters at Denkara, a few hours from the Ajimacoo's camp. He retained the *long stick*, and sent Prince Osoo Ansah, one of the hostages of the last war, and brother to Owoosookookoo, to inform him that he will not open a negotiation with him unless he sends a chief or captain of importance, and that he retains the *long stick*, and would fight with the Ashantees for the next seven years, until the kingdom of Ashantee will come to obedience with the English Government. Meanwhile, he properly organised the native forces, compelled those who had retired from the field to rejoin the camp, settled all disputes and differences amongst them, and inspired new spirit in them. And after a consultation between him and Major Cochrane, they agreed that, should the Ashantees not come to their terms, a simultaneous attack should be made with the regular forces and the native armies—numbering at least about 25,000 men—against the Ashantee force in Soedrue, and either gain a complete victory over them, or compel them to retire from our territory. Owoosookookoo has received the Governor's message, and is still refractory; but he has sent up to communicate with the King. Already the Governor has given orders to the native force to be ready to advance at a moment's notice, and I hope by the next mail I shall be able to communicate something definite to you.\n\nThe Governor had given a commission, as captain of Volunteers, to Mr. Charles Finlason, who has raised a corps of Volunteers and organised them at his own sole charge. The Governor honoured this corps under Captain Finlason by accepting them as his bodyguard and escort.\n\nEnsign Brien, of the Gold Coast Artillery Corps, has died of dysentery.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.61, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We reproduce elsewhere two important papers relating to West Africa. One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes.

Much must be left to the Commissioner’s tact and discretion. A body of Haussas are now being enlisted for the police service, and in time we may hope that the law will reach well into the interior, and that free traffic will be carried on without the intervention of middlemen. The numerous creeks and rivers form useful waterways, though they are hotbeds of malaria. It will be the business of the Commissioner and his staff, moreover, to encourage and even carry on experiments in the way of introducing new cultures and new industries. Major MacDonald has been in communication with Kew and with Sir Alfred Moloney, who has done such good work in Lagos. He will take out with him a large supply of seeds of various kinds, and begin by establishing an experimental garden at Old Calabar.\n\nMajor MacDonald’s own head-quarters will be at Old Calabar, where there is some kind of Consular building. But, of course, he will be pretty constantly on the move. His Vice-Consuls will be stationed as follows: General Hammill on the Bonny River; Mr. T. A. Wall at Old Calabar; Captain H. L. Gallwey on the Benin River; Captain F. Synge on the Forcados; Captain MacDonald on the Brass River; Mr. W. Armstrong on the Opobo River.

The treasurer of the Commissionership is Mr. J. F. Roberts, while Mr. Tanner is Major MacDonald’s private secretary. There are besides four Consular clerks—Mr. Steains, Mr. C. Harrison, Mr. F. Wilding, and Mr. G. Quilter. This is a large staff, but not too large for the many duties which will have to be performed, in a climate where it is hardly safe to stay for more than a year at a time. It is hoped that the Customs dues to be collected will defray the cost of administration. Of course, the whole arrangement is a compromise. But it is to be expected that in time, under Major Macdonald, the progress made will be such as to justify the taking over of the Oil Rivers as a Crown colony.

Our colonies have been abandoned; have been made over to companies; taken over by the Crown, and generally treated without any sort of continuity of policy.

The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence.

The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows.

In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

In Nyasaland large numbers of lakeside Tonga and Tumbuka migrated from the Rukuru watershed to outside the sphere of British control to avoid paying taxes; 43 Creation of refugee communities in desolate areas constituted a variant of the withdrawal strategy. Rather than crossing international boundaries, the peasants, many of whom had refused to satisfy their 'legal' responsi- bilities, created autonomous enclaves. This phenomenon occurred with some regularity among Bemba dissidents who fled into the interior. 'Out of reach, the mi tanda dwellers attained a kind of independence which they fiercely and jealously guarded'.$^{44}$ A similar pattern occurred in the Gambo region of southern Angola which became a hide-out for outlaws and the disenchanted, in the rugged Gaerezi mountains separating Mozambique from Southern Rhodesia, and in the forest and mountainous areas of the Congo.$^{45}$ Although little is known about the internal organization of these communities, their commitment to remain free and their location in harsh backwater areas is strikingly similar to that of the maroon communities of escaped slaves in the Americas. 46 Other fugitive communities, not content just to remain outside the sphere of European control, adopted an aggressive posture towards the colonial regimes. They attacked specific symbols of rural oppression - the planta› tions, labour recruiters, tax collectors and African police - in an effort to protect their natal villages and kinship groups from continued harassment and exploitation. Like the 'social bandits' of Sicily or north-eastern Brazil, analysed by Eric Hobsbawm,$^{47}$ the attacks were led by individuals who were not regarded as criminals by their own society, although they had violated the laws of the colonial regime.

Most likely the missionaries had left on the advice of Shepstone, who knew of the impending war, just as he had done in 1877. 47 On 11 December 1878 the full ultimatum was delivered to the Zulu representatives. It demanded the dismantling of the Zulu army, acceptance of a British resident, reinstatement of all the missionaries, and payment of fines from the various alleged violations of the Natal border and persons. 48 The ultimatum was simply impossible to meet within the specified twenty to thirty days. When the time expired, the British forces under LieutenantGeneral Lord Chelmsford invaded the Zulu kingdom on 10 January 1879.\nChelmsford's army consisted of 15000 soldiers, many of whom were Africans drafted in Natal, while Cetshwayo's force probably numbered 45000. The major advantage enjoyed by the British was their firearms, which were most effective when used in combination with such defensive measures as trenches, walls of waggons or sandbags. The Zulu, on the other hand, fought with spears and shields and had a limited number of guns which they had not yet integrated fully into their military technology and training. The shields were useless against bullets. The spears were devastatingly lethal in close combat, but the Zulu were not allowed to profit from this advantage by the British army, which fired at them from a long distance. The result was that in nearly all the battles the Zulu suffered enormous casualties while striving to get near their enemies. It was only at Isandhlwana on 22 January 1879 that the Zulu tackled a British column in the open and thoroughly beat it.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal.

Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

Even the great conqueror himself has been glad to find safety there for one of his sons, whom the crafty and savage Cetchwayo, who has usurped the reality of power in his father's dominions, and destroyed all other blood rivals, would have slaughtered. The stream of refugees really fleeing for their lives has been constantly flowing into the colony, which has been more than once at the point of war with the Zulu tyrant because of the reception and protection given to these people, until their number now amounts, as we have stated above, to nearly 200,000 souls.""}, {'id': 5848, 'article_title': 'THE DAHOMIAN RAID ON PORTO NOVO', 'full_section_title': 'THE DAHOMIAN RAID ON PORTO NOVO', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_06_1889#article-4', 'issue_date': '03_06_1889', 'content': ""From Lagos we learn that a descent has been made by the Dahomians on Porto Novo.

It was reported that a deputation from the King of Dahomey had waited on the Acting-Governor of Lagos, asking him to take the country of Dahomey under British protection. The King had sent one of his chiefs as the head of the deputation to explain his Majesty's intentions and to show his good will.\n\nAbout the middle of April, later news from Porto Novo is to the effect that matters are quieter there. Three French men-of-war have arrived at Kontano, and a number of troops have been landed, and the inhabitants who had fled at the approach of the Dahomians are returning.\n\nThe cause of the trouble is stated to be a grievance of long standing—namely, the closing of the trade routes to the interior by King Tofa, of Porto Novo. The Dahomians had frequently threatened that if the roads were not opened they would make a descent upon the place, and they ultimately carried out this threat. The presence of the French force in the neighbourhood will help in the settlement of the dispute.\n\nTelegraphic advices received in London on June 4 from Lagos report that the French Resident official at Porto Novo was at Lagos, and that the occupation of Abeokuta and Dahomey was being freely discussed. These places are the great centres through which the bulk of the produce passes to Lagos, and any occupation of these places by a foreign nation would be regarded as a serious impediment to the British colony, since the interior markets could be tapped and the trade diverted to Porto Novo, a French protectorate, or, perhaps, other places.""}]","[{'document_title': 'ZULULAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a debate in the House of Commons, about two years ago, upon a motion in favour of the restoration of the Zulu King to his throne, Mr. Gladstone observed that ""it must be remembered that the peace and welfare of the country ought to be the dominant consideration,"" and went on to remark that Cetewayo\'s release, unless desired by the great body of the Zulu people, ""would be a new cause of political disturbance, and an extensive shedding of blood."" Cetewayo was restored at the beginning of last year, and there ensued at once a condition of misery and strife which verified only too faithfully Mr. Gladstone\'s prophecy of the ""extensive shedding of blood."" The Zulu King, so far from being welcomed, was expelled from his dominions by his former subjects, and died a few months ago, a refugee under the protection of British troops. Under such circumstances no one can deny that Mr. Gladstone was right in holding that we became saddled with ""a serious addition to the responsibility we had already incurred."" Melancholy and discreditable though the story be, it is necessary that we should consider our responsibility, and to what extent our Government has attempted to make ""the peace and welfare of the Zulu country the dominant consideration.""\n\nLess than six years ago the Zulus were a prosperous people, in possession of a fertile country, and occupying a position of pre-eminence among the native races of South Africa. In the interests principally of the Transvaal Boers, who had most to fear from Cetewayo, we invaded the Zulu country, overthrew the native government, and broke up the national organization. From that moment, as Mr. Gladstone has admitted, our responsibility towards the Zulus was created. In the words of Mr. Fynn, the British Resident with Cetewayo, ""from a native point of view, the Zulus thereby became the adopted children of the English."" They looked to us for a government, and were ready to pay us taxes. We did give them a government, but it was one divided among thirteen chieftains, and it lacked one absolute essential—a supreme central authority. The British Resident, whom the natives expected to possess such authority, was soon discovered by them to be a mere puppet. For that reason, and owing to external agitation, the first government we gave the Zulus broke down. In recognition of our duty to find them a better one, we restored Cetewayo to represent the paramount authority which had been hitherto wanting—in defiance, it must be said, of the most solemn promises made to the chiefs who were superseded. This was followed by a period of bloodshed, misery, and anarchy far more calamitous than anything before; but the sudden and timely death of Cetewayo gave the British authorities a golden opportunity for securing ""the peace and welfare of the country.""', 'last_edit_date': '1884-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1884#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LACK OF POLICY IN ZULULAND.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As the opinion of one who speaks from a lengthened and intimate acquaintance with the condition and needs of Zululand, the following (a letter contributed to a contemporary by Mr. F.

The two or three thousand British troops who have been stationed for months in Zululand have done little or nothing to restore peace to the country. Their presence has been of little profit to the Zulus, whom we have wronged, or to the colonists of Natal. It is the Boers of the Transvaal who have been the real gainers by our policy, gainers to the extent of nearly three millions of fertile acres of Zululand. To us, as the Reserve Territory becomes every day more crowded by Zulus flying from the misery of their own country, the burden of protecting it becomes heavier. But the Boer appropriation of the country thus denuded of its native owners becomes easier and more extensive. If the policy of our Government is persisted in, there is nothing to prevent them from handing over the whole country to Germany. The effect of this upon the inhabitants of South Africa is notorious. The Swazi King asks: \'What benefit shall we derive from a British Resident in the country? There has been a British Resident in the Zulu country ever since the war, and he has not prevented the Boers from taking the country.\' Mr. Merriman told Lord Derby that among Cape colonists \'nothing gives a worse impression of English policy and of English dealing in South Africa than their action towards the Zulu people.\' The Zulu question is a purely Imperial one. Even if the war of 1879 was partly due to the Natal colonists, the policy ever since has been directed exclusively from home, and in opposition to the authorities of Natal.

Several months ago some Kafirs, attracted to the ""Diamond-fields"" by the rush thither of many persons from all parts of South Africa, took occasion to supply themselves with rifles at the diggings. This proceeding coming to the ears of the Natal authorities, who have (and properly enough) forbidden the natives to have in their possession unregistered or concealed arms, an order was forthwith issued that the offending Kafirs should at once register their rifles. It appears that there was either a delay or a refusal to act on this order, and measures were taken to enforce compliance. Three young colonists lost their lives in attempting to arrest the Kafirs. Hereupon a large party of soldiers and colonists set out in pursuit of the offending natives, who fled across the mountains, leaving their wives, children, and cattle behind. Failing in their attempt to seize the males, the colonists made a wholesale sweep of all the female relatives and property of the fugitives, and, it would seem, with little discrimination as to whether they were taking the families of the innocent or the guilty. Not content with stealing from 8,000 to 9,000 head of cattle, and large numbers of sheep, goats, and horses, the Colonial authorities kidnapped (according to successive Reuter\'s telegrams) fifteen hundred of the helpless Kafir women, the wives, sisters, and children of the fugitives and others. And now comes the worst part of this disgraceful business. It is stated in the latest despatches that the wretched creatures thus torn away by wholesale from their homes, are to be ""distributed,"" and ""apprenticed out at a distance from their former homes."" ""Applications have been received for 5,000 of them, if procurable, from persons willing to employ them."" Now what does this mean? All who are acquainted with the relations of colonists and natives (especially as illustrated by the brutalities of the Queensland colonists towards their enslaved and kidnapped Polynesian islanders—slaves under the guise of ""apprenticeship"") will know well that this apportionment of Kafir women and children must naturally result in the grossest cruelties and abuses. These and other evils and crimes have as yet passed without protest from the mother country; especially as the immediate danger of a Kafir war has passed away. But the scandal is so serious—the disgrace, which such proceedings are calculated to cast on the British name, one of so dark a dye, that it is needful that the Parliament and people of Great Britain should insist upon full inquiry, and if these facts be established, emphatically express their abhorrence of such enormities, perpetrated by men assuming the name and character of Englishmen in Natal.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-02-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/26_02_1874#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Hutton on West African Affairs', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The West African settlements comprise Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos.

Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river.

Mr. Murphy comes from Equatorville, an important centre of the State Government, 800 miles in the interior, and has lived on the Congo for the past nine years. Regarding the situation when he left in August, Mr. Murphy said:\n\n""When I left the people were in a very unsettled condition, and most unfriendly to the State. The revolt which had broken out in the Aruwimi district had been quelled, but not until the State troops, which had retired upon Basoko and had to withstand a siege there, had been reinforced. Scarcely, however, had the steamers which had been sent to the relief of the station returned to Stanley Pool before two were again despatched to quell another disturbance which had broken out at Luluaburg on the Kasai. This time it was a revolt of the State troops against their own officers. The soldiers killed one and wounded another, leaving him for dead upon the field. They then looted the station and escaped into the interior. Although the authorities sent up a strong detachment of forces from Stanley Pool, most of the fugitives are still at large. I was near the mouth of the Kasai when the news of the revolt came down.\n\n""The attitude of the Natives of the Congo State is unfriendly, and if they do not rebel it is because they are reduced to a state of despair. If possible they leave the territory. Two of the most flourishing towns at Stanley Pool—viz., Kintamo and Kinchassa—are now no more, and the people have gone over to the French Congo. Besides, many people have left the main river and gone into the interior to escape the arbitrary demands of the State. Difficulties arose, too, between the State and the porters, and if the requisite number of carriers were not forthcoming detachments of soldiers were ordered to capture all the women they could find. Several Christians were arrested in this manner. The Natives and missionaries remonstrated, and presented a letter to the Governor without getting any redress. The people were so enraged at these outrages that they took matters into their own hands. They killed three white men and met and defeated the State forces in more than one pitched engagement. On the Lower Congo the Natives have good Snider rifles, and their many conflicts with the State have taught them the arts of war.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'All labour is performed by the domestic slaves of the family, who, as a rule, are kindly treated, and are not often parted with, except under circumstances of necessity.\n\nThere is some reason to suppose that coloured traders and trading agents, when following their avocations at a distance from the settlements, occasionally engage in slave-dealing transactions with the natives; but these operations are conducted beyond British jurisdiction, and as yet it has been found impossible to bring any case home to an offender.\n\nIn point of unhealthiness the climate of the Gambia probably varies little from that of the other settlements. There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

Recently, negotiations with the German Government resulted in the place being handed over to the Empire, and a German representative is now permanently settled in the island.

Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged. When the governor and his party escaped from the fort, the Asante fought several pitched battles with the British which lasted from April to November 1900 when Yaa Asantewaa was arrested and deported with other Asante generals to the Seychelles.\nSimilar revolts, pitched battles and guerrilla warfare raged in the Ivory Coast in response to the brutal methods including forced labour and high taxation used by that cruel Governor, Angoulvant, for the consolidation of French rule and the exploitation of the colony.

This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all.

In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate.

Two main reasons accounted for this feature. First, there were cases where capital on a scale beyond the ability of Africans was required, for example in copper mining in Northern Rhodesia and iron-ore mining in Sierra Leone. Second, and this had a wider applicability, the colonial administrations deliberately and systematically excluded Africans from benefiting from the mineral resources of their country. Soon after mineral deposits were found a series of legislative measures was introduced to give monopolies to imperialist interests. Even where Africans had been working minerals for generations, it became illegal for the African to be found in possession of minerals without a licence. No Africans were allowed to deal in diamond mining. The industry, both in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast, was monopolized by the Consolidated African Selection Trust (CAST), a powerful multinational company engaged in mining a number of minerals. This monopoly was granted on the pretext that the diamonds market could not be controlled where a number of dealers were operating. Whatever the rationale, bowing to the pressure of international capital, the colonial administration viciously excluded the local population from this most lucrative industry of the day.

It was not until the 1950s, when it became impossible to police the extensive diamondiferous areas, that the government was forced to legalize African participation. 54 But even in the cases where Africans could take mining licences from the beginning, a number of regulations and technicalities minimized African participation. In the Nigerian tin-mining industry, for instance, it was a crime for the mine owner, in his absence, to leave the mine under the charge of an African, regardless of his qualifications.$^{55}$ In Sierra Leone an African could not secure a mining licence unless he could read and understand the Mining Ordinance of 1927, which was written in English. Thus inability to read English disqualified an individual outright from participating in mining.$^{56}$ All the same, mining was established as a viable industry.\nThe export sector of the countries under discussion, comprising mainly agricultural products and minerals, expanded fast.

Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further.

Within five years of the discovery in Griqualand, more than £1.6 million-worth of diamonds was being annually exported.

Instead, the 'official mind' historians see British expansion, in the final analysis, as occurring when policy-makers are drawn irresistibly into the African (including the South African) interior to stop 'crises or emergencies' on the 'frontier' or 'periphery' of their formal colonial holdings or informal empire. However, what is omitted, Atmore and Marks point out, is the thorough analysis of these crises, which in the end proved so crucial for the creation of the British empire. In fact, when these crises are explored, they reveal that they were actually 'related to the break-down of indigenous authorities under the weight of the demands of an increasingly industrialized Britain.' In the early nineteenth century these pressures occurred mostly on the eastern front in South Africa, where the informal agents of industrialized Britain - the missionaries, traders, and administrators - were active. But with mineral discoveries in the interior in the late nineteenth century, the demands of industrialized Britain rapidly shifted there and were imposed upon both the African states and the Boer republics. Thus, although the strategic importance of the Cape on the sea route to India continued to influence British imperial policy in South Africa in the late nineteenth century, expanding British economic interests in the subcontinent weighed preponderantly."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.566, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'The annexation of Lesotho represented a change in the British policy of withdrawal from territory north of the Orange river. The change became even more apparent with the disallowing of Transvaal territorial expansion in 1868 and the annexation of Griqualand West in 1871. British expansion coincided with the era of mineral discoveries in Southern Africa. In 1867 a diamond was picked up at Hope Town in the Cape Colony, and the following year alluvial and dry digging for diamonds started along the Vaal river towards its junction with the Orange river. In 1868 an elephant hunter called Henry Hartley and Carl Mauch, a geologist, reported the existence of gold deposits between the Ndebele and Ngwato countries as well as in Mashonaland. Even though the gold discoveries proved largely illusory, they initially aroused a great deal of interest both in South Africa and Britain, while diamond mining grew rapidly into a major South African industry.\nPresident Pretorius, whose state seemed chronically poor, saw a chance of pulling it out of its predicament by enlarging its borders in such a way that it encompassed most of the known mineral deposits and had an outlet to the sea. In April 1868 he announced that his republic stretched north and west to Lake Ngami and east to include a small section of the coast line south of Delagoa Bay. The Portuguese, who had the tiny village of Maputo near Delagoa Bay, and the British missionaries and traders whose road to Central Africa was threatened, all protested vigorously and put pressure on the government to prevent the Boer expansion.

Carnarvon appointed Shepstone to be the Special Commissioner for the Transvaal and on 9 October 1876 empowered him to take over the republic with or without the consent of its volksraad. Various motives for the annexation of the Transvaal have been suggested. The Transvaal was known to contain mineral deposits that made it potentially the richest part of South Africa. The Transvaal blocked the free flow of labour from within Transvaal and from the neighbouring regions. The Transvaal government was also threatening to build a railway to Delagoa Bay so that it could not only be independent of the British colonial harbours but also threaten British supremacy by entering into relations with foreign powers. Carnarvon further calculated that the annexation of the Transvaal would result in the encirclement of the Orange Free State and therefore force the latter to come to terms. Shepstone's take-over of the Transvaal on 12 April 1877, though clumsy and not calculated to conciliate the Boers, was relatively simple because the republic was bankrupt and its president unpopular. 41 Having annexed it, Carnarvon appointed Sir Bartle Frere as the Governor and High Commissioner to carry his 'scheme of federation into effect.' 42 Frere's task was far from easy. The Cape Colony refused to take the lead in the confederation movement; its leaders regarded the British efforts to encourage it to do so as unwanted interference with its responsible status. The Orange Free State was also against being dragged into the union. When in 1878 Frere invited its leaders to a conference to discuss the issue, President Brand replied that the republic was doing so well in every sphere of life that its leaders could not contemplate the loss of"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.561, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'Indeed, Norman Etherington$^{31}$ goes a long way to substantiating the views of Atmore and Marks when he shows that after the discovery of diamonds, African labour was drawn from all over the subcontinent, including what are today Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and that the Trans› vaal, Orange Free State and the Zulu kingdom obstructed its free flow. Moreover, Shepstone, the key source of information in the 1870s for British policy-makers and operators, was not only concerned about immediate solutions to the problem of securing African labour for the British capital› ists, but looked further to see the solution to the whole problem as lying in a federation of the white states with a common African policy. Clearly, therefore, some accounts of British imperialism in South Africa have neglected the growing economic importance of the region to Britain, a situation which became increasingly apparent at the end of the 1860s with the discovery of diamonds and reports of gold deposits, and most evident in the i88os when gold began to be mined in the Witwatersrand.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.596, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British expansion in South Africa 1870-80', 'content': 'Between 1871 and 1874, however, the British government tried to secure a federation of the South African states and thereby to guarantee the security of its interests in South Africa by means of persuasion.

To the disappointment of the British, the Cape government agreed to annex Lesotho but turned down the offer of Griqualand West. The offer was refused because the Cape had a large Boer population that sympathized with the republics, which never gave up their claims to the diamond fields. By the middle of 1873, Lord Kimberley, the Colonial Secretary, confessed that the quarrels over the diamond mines stood in the way of a South African confederation and stopped pressing for it. 32 Lord Carnarvon, who succeeded Kimberley in February 1874, resusci› tated the federation policy and officially launched it on 4 May 1875.

Allow me, therefore, Mr. Editor, place for a few words? Is Governor Pine a man whose principles are opposed to peace? Is he much in fault? Has his administration deserved the insinuations, the sneers, and the blame heaped upon it? Could any official that we have yet known, do better than he has done in this Ashantee trial? We say, No. In our humble opinion, he is not to blame in anything with regard to this state of affairs, any more than it was in the power of any human being to overrule the course of things, or undo the wrong acts and avert the necessary consequences of past irregular Administrations? Do they who thus inconsiderately impugn the present Administration, bear in mind how very short a time this functionary had been on the Gold Coast and assumed the reins of government, before the invasion of our territories by the Ashantees took place? Is it not generally known on this Coast that the late sudden incursion had for its ostensible as well as real object the capture of Agiman, chief of eastern Akim? Now, let us quote General Owosookokoh\'s own words, in answer to the Governor\'s message as regards his cousin\'s (or father\'s) real object in ordering him to attack the Protectorate: ""My father,"" says the Ashantee general, ""has been insulted by Agiman, and for this reason he sent me down to take him to Coomassie."" Here we find no mention was made, not even an allusion to ""Gwanin,"" whose protection by the Governor some regard in a light so unfavourable. Then let us see how this *coup de main* of the lynx-eyed Quako Duah, King of the Ashantees, had been rendered easy by former maladministration (with which Governor Pine could never have anything to do except to be unjustly taxed for the results). A case comparatively trifling in the origin, and which, had it been timely looked into, would have saved much trouble and bloodshed, was shamefully mismanaged; and consequently terminated in a civil war between this Agiman and his nephew King Attah, of the Akims. After this bloody display of animosity, a disunion of course took place between these chiefs of Akim, which event was allowed to pass almost unnoticed in the proper quarters until very lately, when our present Governor, becoming aware of this gross neglect of his predecessor, and of the state of things at Akim, sent commissioners to arrange the dispute, which endangered the peace and safety of the whole Protectorate. We need scarcely add that had this want of unity between Agiman and Attah been prevented in time, the Ashantees would not have dared to make any such pretensions, much less to strike a blow, seeing that they understand very well the strength of the whole Akim in unity. The cowardly circumstances connected with the inroads of the Ashantees in 1853, and the sequel, clears off any doubt on this matter. They detained Captain Brownell in their camp. Essiamowah Quantah, their general, who dared not come nearer than Fosoway (fifty-two miles from the Coast), was afraid to let go so important a security as Captain Brownell\'s person until he saw his own army safely back at the other side of the Praah. And why was this general afraid to make a bold front when he found he could not coolly secure the object of his expedition, as did General Owosookokoh with impunity in the late campaign? Simply, because united Akim, on the side of the Protectorate, rendered his position rather too dangerous to attempt anything like that. But we say such a thing has been attempted latterly, and with success, too, by another Ashantee general, in the very heart of the country, within only a few hours\' journey from the Coast; and how? Simply, because Akim was dissevered, Agiman of eastern Akim at variance with his head, and thus the culpable negligence of a former Governor afforded Owosookokoh the chance of striking us and withdrawing in safety. How, then, is Governor Pine to blame in this matter? Why is this war ludicrously styled Pine\'s war? Governor Pine, unlike many of his predecessors, is faithful to his trust. Like David of old, he is a kind shepherd, that would on no account whatever leave the sheep at the mercy of the bear. Was it not his duty to snatch devoted Agiman and the rest of the protectorate from the paw of the Ashantee lion? As the representative of the protector of this protectorate, would it not have been considered rather a disgrace if he had denied Gwanin the protection he sued for? Is he, then, to be abused and depreciated in the estimation of the public just because he could not do everything—overrule the course of events and exceed the limits assigned to man? For our part, we do not believe in any such *superhumanum*. We only know this much of Governor Pine, that if his counsels, proposals, and plans were encouraged and carried out, this country would be strong against its usual enemies in time of war and improve in time of peace. This expression of our opinion dates so late as the 13th August, 1864. We do not, therefore, think it prematurely expressed: whereas we have yet to learn definitely in what Governor Pine has been to blame—his conduct in the Ashantee affair considered. Until this is demonstrated, our opinion remains unshaken by the sneers of disaffected men. Governor Pine has won most hearts in the community by his own merits. Most of the kings and chiefs of the Gold Coast like and love him. Merchants, respectable men and women of sound principles, love him—very unimportant few do otherwise, the majority of whom are of his skin, who perhaps do so abuse and misrepresent his administration out of the merest grudge.

With the imperfect information we at present possess, we are not able to form any reliable opinion as to whether the rumour of war, or the war itself, should it take place (which we do not at all believe), would temporarily affect the interests of the mining Companies, by interfering with the progress of their works. We see no reason why it should do so, except the reason of ""panic,"" which may not impossibly lead to the retreat of the working staff to Axim until the trouble shall have passed away. Our opinions as to this trouble will be found in our leader on the subject. One thing however, is quite certain—namely, that even if it should temporarily affect in some prejudicial way the interests of the several Mining Companies working in Wassaw, it cannot have any permanent ill results. Those results seem to us, to be as well assured as any mining operations can be. The more we examine into and consider the evidence we possess, the more strongly are we convinced that the opinions we have hitherto expressed as to the great success that must attend those mining operations, if well conducted—the more strongly, we say, are we convinced that these Wassaw Gold Mines will within a short time stand forth pre-eminently at the head of all the gold mining operations now organized for various parts of the world. We have been comparing the Effuenta, for instance, with the ""Potosi,"" the prospectus of which lately convulsed the speculative mining market for a few hours, and we have no hesitation in saying that if the ""Potosi"" was worth, to purchase, 250,000l., with founders\' shares to be redeemed by another 100,000l., the sum for which it was purchased from the vendors, then the ""Effuenta,"" or the African Gold Coast, at present, and the Gold Coast Mining later, are worth 500,000l., or half a million each. The value of the Effuenta ore-bed does not seem to be yet exactly ascertained, but it is certainly equal to that of the African Gold Coast, and we see no reason whatever to doubt the truth and accuracy of M. Verillon\'s (the managing director) report as regards this: that by indiscriminate samples taken by him personally from three of the stoping grounds, the value of the ore in their ore-bed was and is 5l. 4s. per ton of ore; that they expect it richer at lower depths to which they are going; and that the mine, as opened, will be capable of being worked up to a production of 100 tons of ore per day, while the quantity is such that the mine would not be exhausted in a century. As we have said above, what the African Gold Coast Company\'s mine thus described is, so is the Effuenta Mine, at least, and so, at least, will be the Gold Coast Mining Company\'s mine; and we reaffirm that if the Potosi is worth what was paid for it, each of these is worth half a million.'}, {'id': 4161, 'article_title': 'WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'full_section_title': 'WEST AFRICAN NEWS.', 'last_edit_date': '03-01-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_03_1881', 'content': '## WEST AFRICAN NEWS.\n\n**THE THREATENED WAR WITH ASHANTI.**—The Mail steamer Bonny, of the British and African Steam Navigation Company, arrived at Madeira a few days ago from the West Coast of Africa.

Even had the Ashantee King possessed an army with which invasion might be made, he would have had to encounter the Denkeeras and the Akims before he could get any of his troops into Wassaw; and Wassaw, in the old war with Ashanti—1873-4—sent a contingent of 8,000 men against the Ashantees.

It was, as we felt from the first convinced that it was, only a ""scare."" The alarming tales of armies of invading Ashantees never for one moment deceived us. We knew by experience what ready manufacturers the Fantees are of such tales, though on the late occasion they certainly surpassed all their former exploits in this fertile field of invention. From Axim we heard the wonderful intelligence that the King of Ashanti could bring 90,000 warriors into the field; 28,000 men were reported as already massed on the Prah; 8,000 or 10,000 had already crossed that river, and were within three days\' march of Cape Coast! And these were all, like Falstaff\'s ""men in buckram,"" a myth—a pure creation of terrified or interested Fantee imagination! But what a glorious time for the weak-kneed officials of Cape Coast and Accra; what hurrying to and fro; what concoction of sensational despatches and official and semi-official communications; what special chartering of mail steamers; what splendid military organizations! What a glorious thing it was to know that there was a surplus of 70,000l. to the credit of Gold Coast Revenue, which might now be lavishly expended in meeting a grand imaginary danger, which would have faded away like the ""baseless fabric of a dream""—which it was—at the touch of a few grains of cool common sense. But when has common sense ever had anything to do with Gold Coast government? Let any unprejudiced and dispassionate person read the account we now publish under the head of ""The African Kings Transported by the late Governor Ussher,"" and they will be able to form some idea of the wisdom, justice, equity, and high policy that have characterised British rule on the Gold Coast. The individual mentioned as having received the two hundred ounces of the King of Ashanti\'s gold is well known to us, and we have no reason to doubt the entire correctness of our informant\'s statement, which we earnestly recommend to the consideration of Sir Samuel Rowe and of Earl Kimberley. The article to which our correspondent takes exception, and which induced him to make us this communication, was not intelligence sent expressly to us, but information given to the purser of the steamer Ambriz, and by him to the Press on the arrival of the steamer at Liverpool—information furnished, we have very little doubt, by the identical Mr. —— referred to. Is it not deplorable to see a British Crown Colony thus misgoverned? To whatever cause the disgracefully hasty withdrawal of our conquering troops from Coomassie after the capture and burning of that royal residence, might be owing, a ""policy"" having a definite end in view should at least have been inaugurated and steadily and uniformly pursued. That ""policy,"" if common sense were to have anything to do in the government of the Gold Coast—a country which will ere long take rank as one of the richest, if not the richest, subject to the British Crown—must and would have been to prevent any such reconstitution of the Ashantee Power as could place it in a position even to make a ""scare,"" much less undertake an invasion in the Fantee countries. That such a policy has not been pursued, is but too painfully evident by the expenditure on a ""scare"" of that surplus revenue so much needed for education, improvement of communications, and other objects of utility, hitherto almost entirely neglected. There will now, we hope, be a fresh departure. The gold mining industries now establishing themselves in those rich territories of the Gold Coast Government are too important in themselves, and too necessary to Great Britain as an annual debtor to the United States of America of some 20,000,000l. sterling to be paid in gold, to allow of this question of the permanent relation of the Gold Coast territories with the interior to be any longer trifled with, or left at the mercy of the crass ignorance of accidental yet permanent Governors, who may be ready to give to any modern representative of the daughter of Herodias ""whatever she may ask of him."" What is first of all necessary, indispensable, is that the British Government should wake to the conviction that in the Gold Coast territories they have one of the most valuable and, under present international circumstances, most vitally important possessions of the British Crown. The sooner they arrive at this conviction the better for the national welfare. Having once arrived at this conviction, they will inaugurate and pursue a ""policy."" The French Government are setting them the example. They have evidently inaugurated, and are pursuing, one in the north and north-west of Africa, the success of which is only problematical, while the success of that which we demand for the Gold Coast Colony is certain and assured. And it must be borne in mind that the expressed objective point of the French effort is the source of the River Niger, at which, if they succeed in establishing themselves, they will be high up on, and will command, the northern slope of those Kong Mountains the southern slope of which ought to be the objective point of British enterprise. The great gold field of West Africa, which we have no hesitation in affirming for the hundredth time to be the richest in the world, is the prize for which the two nations are contending. The British Government must not hesitate in the pursuit of this prize, and must not allow the French to outstrip them in the race. The future of the Gold Coast depends upon the energy and determination with which the British Government pursues its policy in this matter. The time for hesitation is past; the time for action is now.\n**43**', 'last_edit_date': '1881-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1881#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'No one can lament more than we do the loss of life and treasure caused by this deplorable Ashantee war.

We see no reason why it should do so, except the reason of ""panic,"" which may not impossibly lead to the retreat of the working staff to Axim until the trouble shall have passed away. Our opinions as to this trouble will be found in our leader on the subject. One thing however, is quite certain—namely, that even if it should temporarily affect in some prejudicial way the interests of the several Mining Companies working in Wassaw, it cannot have any permanent ill results. Those results seem to us, to be as well assured as any mining operations can be. The more we examine into and consider the evidence we possess, the more strongly are we convinced that the opinions we have hitherto expressed as to the great success that must attend those mining operations, if well conducted—the more strongly, we say, are we convinced that these Wassaw Gold Mines will within a short time stand forth pre-eminently at the head of all the gold mining operations now organized for various parts of the world. We have been comparing the Effuenta, for instance, with the ""Potosi,"" the prospectus of which lately convulsed the speculative mining market for a few hours, and we have no hesitation in saying that if the ""Potosi"" was worth, to purchase, 250,000l., with founders\' shares to be redeemed by another 100,000l., the sum for which it was purchased from the vendors, then the ""Effuenta,"" or the African Gold Coast, at present, and the Gold Coast Mining later, are worth 500,000l., or half a million each. The value of the Effuenta ore-bed does not seem to be yet exactly ascertained, but it is certainly equal to that of the African Gold Coast, and we see no reason whatever to doubt the truth and accuracy of M. Verillon\'s (the managing director) report as regards this: that by indiscriminate samples taken by him personally from three of the stoping grounds, the value of the ore in their ore-bed was and is 5l. 4s. per ton of ore; that they expect it richer at lower depths to which they are going; and that the mine, as opened, will be capable of being worked up to a production of 100 tons of ore per day, while the quantity is such that the mine would not be exhausted in a century. As we have said above, what the African Gold Coast Company\'s mine thus described is, so is the Effuenta Mine, at least, and so, at least, will be the Gold Coast Mining Company\'s mine; and we reaffirm that if the Potosi is worth what was paid for it, each of these is worth half a million.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH AUTHORITY AT AXIM.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Gold Coast Times* has only anticipated us in the following:—\n\n""If only a portion of the rumours which reach us from Axim be well-founded, matters would seem to be getting a little \'mixed\' in that district, which, notwithstanding its daily growing importance, is so unaccountably neglected by the \'powers that be.\' It has long been a marvel to many that a district so extensive, and so rapidly rising into note, should be left to the administration of a young subordinate official, who has had no previous training or experience to qualify him for the post; and if things go on much longer as at present, very serious complications must arise, for which the Executive will be almost directly responsible, owing to its failure to place the administration of the gold-mining port and district in the hands of a staid, competent, experienced, and able gentleman.\n\n""If it be true that Sir Samuel Rowe is coming out again as Governor of the Gold Coast, it is much to be desired that he should touch at Axim.

Whilst the husbands sink pits to act as shafts, the wives pan the pay-dirt from ""women\'s washings,"" and expect to extract from 40 lbs. to 50 lbs. of the gravelly soil immediately below the surface-humus—between half-a-dollar and two dollars a day. *Probatum est!* Why not, then, begin at the beginning, and wash on the largest scale the overburden before attacking the rock? The proceeds of panning would purchase machinery and pay its transport; and, at last, when the hillocks are cleared of trees whose roots hide nuggets, and are levelled by the jet or sluice, the quartz-reefs will stand out, like those of Arabian Midian, in the form of stone walls. These will be worked by mere quarrying with the sledge-hammer till the floor rock is found.

It is a most disgraceful thing.\n\nAnd now for something more serious still, considering the uncertainty in which this Coast now lies as regards the extent of British authority, and of British protection in case of invasion. Some Assins went over the river Prah into Ashantee, the other day, and came upon an Ashantee hunting party, upon whom they fell. They cut off the head of the King of Ashantee\'s chief hunter, and made prisoners of all the rest of the party, whom they have, of course, divided among themselves as slaves, sending down one boy to Her Majesty\'s Governor here as his share of the plunder! This boy is here now. It is quite clear that British restraint over the Fantee chiefs and kings must be made effective, so that such flagrant and barbarous violations of Ashantee territory should be prevented, or severely punished, if Great Britain is to have any responsibility as regards the protection of these countries against the Ashantees. But up to the time at which I write no steps whatever have been taken to punish the Assins who have been guilty of this outrage. It is not at all surprising, therefore, that the reports of another invasion by the Ashantees being in preparation are becoming daily more and more consistent. It is said the invasion will take place in September or October next. I feel sure something of the kind will happen unless some reconciliation be effected. But I do not think that the effort I am about to mention will do this. The Honourable George Blankson, of Anamaboe, anxious to see the old trading relations with Ashantee once more re-established, came up here, and several meetings of persons chiefly interested were held. It was finally resolved that messengers should be sent up to ""pave the way,"" and ascertain the possibility of restoring a friendly feeling between King Quaco Duah (who, it deems is not dead) and Cape Coast. I very much fear that the Ashantees, who finesse very much themselves, will think that the Government authorities here are at the bottom of this proceeding; and if they do so think it will only increase their pride.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1865#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is not unlikely that ere this time you have received information about the pending danger which threatens this coast. We have for the last three months been anticipating what, to all intents and purposes, will prove a reality—viz., a war with the King of Ashantee. In November last, one of the captains of the King being ordered up to Comasie, on a charge of robbing what is regarded as the King's quota of gold, and being apprehensive that the issue would cost his head, escaped with eighty adherents from the kingdom of Ashantee to the coast, and claimed protection from the English Government. The King immediately sent one of his principal chieftains, with a number of sword-bearers, to request that the captain and his men should be given up. On his arrival at Cape Coast Castle a grand palaver was held, in which were present the Governor and Council, the principal merchants at Cape Coast and its vicinity, the chiefs and head men of Cape Coast, the runaway chief, as well as the King's messengers. After a long palaver, the last were unable to substantiate the charges against the man, who swore that he would rather have his head cut off before the fort gate than that he should be sent up to Comasie. After long deliberation it was unanimously agreed that the captain and his followers were not to be delivered up until the King should send down witnesses to corroborate the charges alleged against him. The King demanded that the men should be delivered up unconditionally; or, if not, the Governor must stand the consequence. During this time it was noticed that Ashantees, who came down as peaceful traders, bought almost wholly guns, powder, and lead bar, articles which are decidedly munitions of war. The chiefs in the interior got alarmed at this, and seized the articles as the men passed along their territory. Intelligence of this reached Comasie, and from that time the King gave orders to his captains to make preparations for an invasion. In the meantime the King sent to inform the Governor that he had broken the treaty with his Government, and that he (the King) was going to send down one of his captains, who was then in the interior, to show the Governor the treaty. The Governor promised, whenever that should be done, to deliver the captain up, and even escort him to the frontiers of the King of Ashantee with British soldiers. The next information that reached the coast was that a large Ashantee army had crossed the river Prah (the boundary line between the protectorate territory and the kingdom of his Majesty King Quaku Duah) towards the eastern district, and that the King of Akim had fallen back before them to get the support of the tribes on the seashore. A few days afterwards another army crossed the Prah at Assin, in a direct road to Anamaboe and Cape Coast. Most of the men on the seacoast who are able to bear arms have left for the Fantee camp, at the neighbourhood of Assin, where at least about 14,000 men are at present, waiting the movements of the Ashantees. Scouts have been sent out, and some Ashantee heads have been sent down, to corroborate the report that the Ashantees have invaded the Fantee territory. The report is just now current that pickets of the army of Ajeman, King of Western Akim, met an Ashantee pillaging band, fired at them, and wounded their leader, who was brought before the King as a prisoner. He begged hard for his life, and promised to reveal everything about the war. He was made to swear by his King's stool that all that he was about to say were facts. The information he gave was the following: The King, on hearing that the Governor refused to deliver up the men, turned out all the available force, numbering about 60,000 men. Of these, 20,000 were to form a corps of observation on the eastern district, by descending on Akim, and thus preventing the Accras, Aquamhus, and Akims from joining the Fantees, and the remaining 40,000 were to descend upon the Fantees through Assin, sweeping everything before them, until they arrive at Cape Coast and Anamaboe, both of which places they intend to sack; the victorious were then to march against the Accras.

But, then, conditions in Europe during the same period were not so very different either. This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

In practice, the consuls, especially after 1850, continued and stepped up a policy started in the 1830s by Edward Nicolls, Governor of Fernando Po, of signing treaties with the local chiefs.$^{6}$ These treaties stipulated the stoppage of the slave trade by the rulers; the adoption of 'legitimate trade', that is, trade in goods other than slaves; laid down regulations for the conduct of legitimate trade; specified the sums of customs duties or comey to be paid by the traders, as well as subsidies that the British government was to pay the local rulers for their agreement to give up the slave trade.\nThese British activities on the coast gradually eroded the power of the local rulers, especially when the consuls and naval officers assisted the British traders to set up their own judicial systems over and above the law of the local states, the so-called Courts of Equity, composed mainly of British traders with the participation of a few local House Heads or chiefs.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other.

This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states.

There was an overall revival of coercion in economic relations, indicating that the colonial economy had to be buttressed by non-economic means when in crisis. African labour and taxes kept the railways viable and maintained colonial revenues. Yet, the African masses suffered most from the cutback on already skimpy social services, such as medicine and education, and they had to pay more for these services. In the years of recovery after 1934, wages, prices and facilities for Africans remained retrenched in contrast to the return to high profit levels for private capital.\nColonial governments granted minimum relief to Africans suffering from the depression. They suspended tax collection, and they subsidised prices, as the French did for groundnuts. They also tried to moderate the crudest forms of middleman exploitation. These measures arose out of necessity, since no money was circulating and since lower prices in one country forced desperate peasants to march long distances and smuggle their produce out through an area where there was some marginal advantage. As far as the middlemen were concerned, the governments needed to restrain them from cornering the reduced profit rather than let it be exported. However, in East Africa the 'Asian' merchants were essential for keeping the money economy intact and avoiding reversion to barter, just as their capital had been the original basis for the extension of specie and small-scale money exchanges throughout the region.$^{16}$ In the final analysis, therefore, the British administration co-operated to protect the interests of these retailers and produce buyers.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies.

Either the entire administration and commerce of the Colony must be placed on a broader basis, and then a prosperous development of the Colony in every direction is expected with certainty; or the old course is kept up, and then the Colony will meet with unavoidable ruin. According to the present system the Colony must cover all its administrative expenses from the current receipts. These receipts consist, almost exclusively, in the duties levied at the coast. The income of the duty increases and decreases with the commerce in the Colony. German trade in Cameroons, however, is going backward, in consequence of the falling of prices for African products and of the trading monopoly of the tribes on the coast, which more than doubles, often quintuples, the price of the goods from the interior, thereby limiting the intercourse of the coast with the interior. If this continues, the end can easily be foreseen. The Colony will be less capable to recoup its costs of administration—it will require more and more support from the Empire and yet it will not improve. Within the frame of the present administrative system there is no means to check this sinking movement. For the cancer the Colony is suffering from, the monopoly of the Dualla, can only be cured by using stronger and powerful means. To do this the present administration is perfectly incapable. Its means only go so far as to carry out on the coast the most necessary police functions and to exert a limited jurisdiction. This limited power of the German administration does not reach beyond the coast. The armed force consists of a few black policemen in the gun-boat. But, like the Arabs in East Africa, the Dualla in Kamerun will not give up their predatory trade voluntarily; they will have to be forced to restrict themselves to legal commerce and to allow the Europeans to enter their commercial districts—the endeavour to force this, miscarried in East Africa on account of the lack of sufficient power, causing rebellion; a similar proceeding in Kamerun would also have similar consequences. If in East Africa half only of the means of power displayed later on would have been put into requisition at the beginning, a sedition would never have taken place; the Empire would have saved many millions, and the development of the Colony would have taken an undisturbed course. The predictions of the experts are similar now with respect to Kamerun. With relatively small protective forces the entire opposition of the Dualla could be broken. These protective forces would be sufficient to garrison a number of stations on the routes in the interior, facilitating to the German trade a safe pushing forward to the Hinterland. These 200 men could do as much service to the German trade in Kamerun as the 2,000 men of the protective forces in East Africa. It is said that the number of the latter is to be considerably decreased. If this opportunity be seized to transport part of them to Kamerun then the expenses of the new enrolment and equipment of the Kamerun troop would be saved, and we should have a victorious and well-trained troop entering into Kamerun.'}, {'id': 6421, 'article_title': 'The Troubles in Ashanti', 'full_section_title': 'The Troubles in Ashanti', 'last_edit_date': '01-01-1894', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1894#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_01_1894', 'content': ""The British force under Colonel Sir Francis Scott, which left Accra early in October to repel an expected incursion by the King of Ashanti, is still at Abetifi, the capital of Quarhoo, situated on the frontier of the Atabibu Protectorate, which is now no longer threatened.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion. In conclusion, he observed that if these portions of Africa with which he has been dealing could but be brought under the influence indicated, it would bring them an increase of knowledge, of wealth, and of power such as had accrued to them from their dominions in Asia.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-11-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/07_11_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FIGHTING IN CENTRAL AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A brilliant feat of arms has just been accomplished in Central Africa by a small British force, acting against a powerful army of Native chiefs and Arab slavedealers. The scene of the conflict is to the west of Lake Nyassa, in the country known as Angoniland, within the British Central African Protectorate; and a confederacy of slave-dealing chiefs seems to have been formed, with King Mwasigungu at its head, whose object was to dispute the right of the British to interfere with their man-hunting expeditions. Nobody can impute a shadow of bloodguiltiness in this matter to our representatives. Every effort appears to have been made by our Consul-General to come to terms with the barbarous potentate; but Mwasigungu rejected all offers, and actually declared war. No doubt he felt confident of beating the small force of Sikhs and Natives, who could be brought against him, and, as far as numerical superiority went, his confidence was not misplaced. In the actual conflict, Lieut. Alston and Captain Stewart, who commanded the Sikh contingent, had only 150 men under them, to which must be added a body of five thousand Natives. This little army marched into the country of the slave-dealers, and in three battles succeeded in utterly routing King Mwasigungu and the other chiefs, although they had a force of twenty thousand fighters. The danger of the enterprise can be gauged from the fact that two strong stockades had to be taken by assault, and Lieut. Alston is mentioned as having gallantly led the storming parties. Fifty towns were captured by the victorious British troops, and 600 prisoners, including 14 chiefs, fell into their hands. One of the latter, a notorious character, with the stain of past murders on his soul, was taken to the shores of Lake Nyassa, and there tried, condemned, and executed. The loss in the slavedealers\' army was great, while six of the Sikhs seem to have fallen on our side. The capture of ninety guns, and the re-opening of the trade routes to the Luapula river, are not the greatest advantages to be derived from this achievement. The prestige of the Arab slave-dealers will have received a blow in all the region between the Portuguese border and the Loangwa; while the ability of the British to make their Protectorate a reality will be forcibly impressed on the Native mind. Not only has the capital of the presumptuous monarch been captured, but a fort has been built there and garrisoned by Protectorate troops, so that there will be a standing pledge and symbol of our authority in the heart of the country. Thus gradually the tide of civilisation sweeps over the darkest places of the Dark Continent, and not for the first or the last time has British daring and enterprise brought succour to the slave. If the process of ""ransoming the African"" has to be effected by violent means, then it is satisfactory to find that a force under the British flag is capable of meeting four times its number of Arabs, and putting them to rout. In a victory of this description there is much to be proud of and nothing to regret, for it is a triumph of justice and mercy over base greed and cruelty.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V. Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Now as thirty or forty men at most are needed for this duty, this is surely a sorry plea for such a country as Great Britain. If Governor Pine had been reinforced with another regiment, so as to place 2,000 men at his disposal—a force absolutely necessary if the Ashantees are to be constrained to peace or chastised in war—Quittah would have been reoccupied as a matter of course.

Many slave factories in the river have been abandoned and broken up, because ruinous instead of profitable.

A great share in this work fell to Great Britain, and there were signs that the nation had now awoke to a sense of its responsibilities and was prepared to spend a moderate amount of money in the regeneration of Africa. As the result of treaties concluded in 1889-90, a portion of Central Africa was declared to be the British protectorate, and the remainder was described as a British sphere of influence, and placed under the charter of the British South Africa Company. That Company, indeed, had saved the situation. Through the action of Mr. Cecil Rhodes it came forward in 1890 and offered to assist in the administration of Central Africa by contributing towards a police force to put down the slave trade. In 1893, the sums supplied for this purpose amounted to over £20,000, and in previous years they were never less than £10,000. Almost all this money was spent within the British Protectorate, where the Company had few interests and no rights or privileges. In 1891 he (the speaker) was despatched by the Government to form an administration of the Protectorate, and was appointed to administer the British South African Company's territories under the charter. The Navy placed two light draft gunboats on the Zambesi and Shire, and later on a gunboat for the Upper Shire and two vessels of deeper draft for use on Lake Nyassa. But the most efficient and important aid was the recognition of a great principle—the association of the Indian Empire with the affairs of Africa. Her Majesty's Government sanctioned the appeal to the Commander-in-Chief in India for the loan of Indian soldiers to fight against the slave traders; and Lord Roberts allowed the late Capt. Maguire to form a contingent of seventy men for service in British Central Africa for two years. On July 16, 1891, he (the speaker) arrived at Tshioromo, at the junction of the Ruo and the Shire, and two days afterwards the first troubles with the slave-trading chiefs began. During the autumn of that year they fought several battles with the Yaos, and after a series of victories a great disaster befell them. Capt. Maguire had endeavoured to destroy the last two slave dhows belonging to Makanjira, but was killed in the attempt together with three of his men. Two other white men also lost their lives, and this misfortune was followed by the defeat of another portion of the police force by a Yao chief called Zarafi, when six Sikhs were killed and two white officers severely wounded. After this, however, the tide began to turn in their favour. The support they received from the mass of the Natives prevented the Yaos from following up their success, and ultimately the British force had a series of successes, culminating in the route of Makanjira, and the capture and occupation of his country. All this time the civil administration had gone forward. In three years the Trade had increased from £30,000 to £100,000, the number of European settlers from 57 to 265, the local revenue from £1,700 to £13,000. British coinage and weights and measures had been introduced, the acreage under cultivation by Europeans had increased from 1,000 to over 8,000 acres, and valuable coffee plantations were growing. A most marked result of the suppression of the slave trade was the release of an enormous amount of locked-up labour, thanks to the Natives having taken to regular work, finding that they were well paid by the European settlers. Much praise must be given to the Christian missionaries working in Nyassaland, who were assiduous in giving industrial training to the Natives attending their schools. The missionaries taught printing, joinery, brickmaking, cooking, and other useful trades, and if this good work is continued with prudence and assiduity the societies now working in British Central Africa would soon raise the negroes to a much higher level of civilisation. The speaker next referred to the part to be played by India in the development of Central Africa, and remarked that he had chosen three years ago black, white, and yellow as the typical colours of the protectorate—black representing the Negro, white the European, and yellow the Indian. He believed that the welfare of Central Africa could only be attained by the co-operation of those three races. The negro was endowed with magnificent muscular development and physique, but was clumsy and dull-witted; the white man was destined to be the governor and teacher of Africa, and must be at the head of all great departments and the initiator of all great enterprises; but between the Zambesi and Lower Egypt he could not hope to constitute himself a colonist, or to form an appreciable element in the indigenous population. He believed Africa, south of the Zambesi would some day be a white man's country; that pure-blooded white people would form the bulk of the population and the same of Northern Africa. But tropical Africa would never be the home of a white race, though it might be dotted over with little settlements on high mountains and elevated plateaux. He believed the Asiatic to be of equal importance with the white man in the regeneration of Africa. He could stand a hot climate better, he was clever with his hands and wits, though he lacked the initiative and the power of government. The results of the mingling of the Arab with the negro was in certain respects good, but he was so bound up with the principle of slavery, and so bigotted an opponent of European civilisation, as to be eliminated as a useful factor in tropical Africa; in fact, the result of European domination must be to drive the Arabs back to Arabia, and he looked to India to furnish the yellow element so indispensable to Africa. For centuries the trade with east Africa had lain in Indian hands, and they were now commencing to develop the commerce of Central Africa, and were well fitted for the work, being peaceable and law-abiding folk, industrious, modest in their demands as to pay, and able to work hard in a hot climate. As soldiers, he could not speak too highly of the Sikhs, and their chief value was in the way in which they had been able to infuse their own military qualities, training, and discipline into the negro mind. Wherever the Sikhs went the negroes would now follow, and in conflict with a foe white officers no longer found themselves abandoned by black soldiers. The development of trade with India would involve the employment of an increasing number of British Indian subjects, tracts of land now uninhabited might be offered to Indian emigrants, and the increased use of coinage and the absorption of rupees, might, in the course of time, assist in solving the silver question. In conclusion, Mr. Johnston spoke of the market to be opened up for British manufactures. The demand in Africa for British cotton goods was daily increasing, and with patience and timely expenditure the British Government had managed to retain vast districts which, if they had come under the control of another European Power, would have been placed under disadvantageous conditions as regards British trade."", 'last_edit_date': '1894-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1894#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment. It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

This term is in contradistinction to the Upper Niger, from Timbuctoo to the sources, which runs for a distance of 1,000 miles at the back of the French colony of Senegal, and which has been visited by several French exploring parties, though as yet no European trade has been opened there. Nor, indeed, can such trade be carried on profitably until the completion of the railway connecting the waterways of the Senegal and the Upper Niger. Between the latter and the Niger-Binue lies the long stretch of the Middle Niger, from Timbuctoo to Boussa; nature thus interposing a barrier of 800 miles between the Upper Niger basin, which will probably fall to France, and the Niger-Binue basin, which is already occupied by Great Britain. The Niger-Binue was unknown to Europe fifty-five years ago. The wildest theories were held as to the ultimate destination of the Niger—some geographers holding that it was absorbed by an inland sea, others that it fell into the Nile, others that it joined the Congo. The English traveller, John Lander, in 1831 solved the problem by starting from Badagry, and travelling northwards till he reached the Niger, near Boussa, where are the lowest rapids, and where commences the Niger-Binue system. He followed the river down 600 miles to the sea. Immediately on his return home, in 1832, his great discovery was turned to account by some Liverpool merchants, who despatched two steamers to nearly the highest navigable point on the Niger, and to Dagbo on the Binue. Numerous private expeditions from this country followed in the years 1834 to 1864, the most notable event being the formation in 1852 of the African Steamship Company, which established a line to Lokoga at the confluence of the Niger and Binue, 300 miles from the sea. Meanwhile the British Government had made efforts to open up both branches, and to lay down charts. Under an impulse given by Prince Consort, Parliament voted over £50,000 for the expedition of Her Majesty’s ships Albert, Wilberforce, and Soudan, during which the Government obtained the cession of a large tract of country about the confluence at Lokoga, where the British flag flies to this day. Another important expedition was that of 1854-5, during which were laid down most careful charts of the Binue for some hundreds of miles. In 1857 Parliament voted a five years' subsidy, averaging £7,000 a year, to Mr. Macgregor Laird, to assist him in developing trade in these rivers, and it was expressly stated on that occasion that immediate results could not be expected, but that posterity would reap the benefit. In a letter dated the 29th April, 1864, Earl Russell stated that he was willing to recommend a further subsidy of £6,000 for the same object. The proposal fell through—indeed, was rendered unnecessary by the springing up of British trade, which has lasted to the present day."", 'last_edit_date': '1884-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain.

What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly.

The construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and harbours received the attention of the colonial administrations quite early on. Though these facilities helped in the general administration, their main task was to evacuate exports. No wonder therefore that the location and general direc› tion of railways and roads took little account of the general welfare of the dependencies. Most railways ran directly from the coast to interior sources of cash crops or mineral deposits. Only a few lateral and inter-colonial links were established. Railways therefore served only limited areas, and, important as they have been, their role in 'opening up' the continent has certainly been exaggerated.$^{86}$ Only in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa were there more sophisticated railway networks, mainly intended to connect and serve the widely-scattered mining areas and settler farming regions. The cocoa belt of the southern Gold Coast, too, was well served by railways, while the Northern Territories with no export crops, were completely ignored. (See Figs 16.2, 16.3.)\nMost of the railways were constructed, owned, and operated by govern› ments or official agencies.

First, human porterage was replaced by machinery, thereby releasing scarce human resources for other productive activities. Secondly, the decreased cost of transport increased the profit margins of producers and encouraged the expansion of the cash sector. Only rarely, however, did African producers benefit from this development.

Isaacman and J. Vansina have contended, rely on African mercenaries and levies which gave them the numerical superiority they needed.$^{61}$ In fact, as A. Laroui puts it, most of the armies were African in recruitment and only European in command. Above all, by the terms of the Brussels Convention of 1890, the imperial powers agreed not to sell arms to Africans. This meant that most African armies were armed with completely outmoded, old and often unserviceable guns, mainly flint-locks or muzzle-loading muskets, and had plates 2.2(a)-(f) Weapons used by Africans and their European opponents during the wars between 1880 and 1935 (for Plate 2.2(f) see next page) no heavy artillery or naval power whatsoever. The European armies, on the other hand, were armed with the most up-to-date heavy artillery, and guns such as the repeater rifle, and above all the Gatling and the Maxim guns. They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease.

Such a situation came into being by a slow process after the loss of African sovereignty. The colonial economic system cannot be said to have reached its prime until the coming of the Second World War. The years 1880-1935, therefore, cover the laying of the foundations of production relations characteristic of. colonialism. African opposition and resistance held prospective colonizers at bay until the second decade of this century and occasionally longer. Africans responded aggressively to the attempted destruction of their economic independence, as illustrated by some of the more famous anti-colonial resistances already discussed, such as the Hut Tax war in Sierra Leone, the Bailundu revolt in Angola, the MajïMajï wars in German East Africa and the Bambata rebellion in South Africa.\nAfricans witnessed the first physical evidence of a new economy in the form of road, rail and telegraph construction. Transport and communica› tion lines were a prelude to conquest and they were logistically necessary in occupied areas so that the latter could serve as the staging points for further aggression. African rulers were sometimes hostile towards the Europeans building a transport and communications infrastructure. Their followers were told to pull down telegraph posts and tear up railway tracks, as in the Niger/Senegambia region when the French military presence was first manifest in the 1880s and 1890s.$^{1}$ However, few roads or railways were of purely military interest; and the same railways which facilitated conquest were used for the extraction of groundnuts, cotton and so on.\nCoastal African economies were quickly reduced to dependent entities within the economies of the respective colonizing powers, while the interior peoples were usually the last to be brought into the network of produce collection, cash-crop cultivation and paid labour.

Of all the peoples of Kenya, they put up the strongest and longest military resistance to British im› perialism; it began in the 1890s and did not end until their leader was murdered by the British commanders in 1905, on his way to the negotiations which had been treacherously arranged. That event weakened Nandi resistance and eventually led to the British occupation of their territory.\nThat the Nandi resisted the British for over seven years was due to the nature of their society. Nandi society was divided into territorial units called pororiet. Warriors from each unit were responsible for the defence of the territory. For this reason, the warriors slept in a common hut. This was the nearest thing to a standing army. These territorial armies came together under the leadership of an orgoiyot, or traditional leader. It was he who decided when the army would go on a raid. The armies were linked to him through a personal representative who sat at each territorial council. Because territory rather than clan was the centre of Nandi social life, this meant that clan rivalry was absent. The result was a cohesive society, and it was this cohesion that gave the society military superiority over its neighbours. Maison writes that 'It is surprising that so small a tribe as the Nandi was able to terrorize much larger peoples and to continue to do so almost with impunity for several decades.' 11 Given the social cohesion of the society as well as the confidence of the warriors both in themselves and in their leaders, it is not surprising that they became a military power to reckon with. Their military successes led them to believe that they were superior to other people, white men included. As G. W. B. Huntingford noted, 'The Nandi thinks himself at least the equal, if not the superior of the whiteman; and any estimate of the changes brought about by the impact of our civilization must be considered in the light of this fact'.$^{12}$ The Nandi successfully resisted this occupation for over seven years, then, because of the success with which the society had been knit together as a fighting force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The War on African soil', 'content': ""all Britain's longed-for Cape to Cairo route.$^{!}$ ' But once it was clear that quick victory would not be achieved, it was perceived that protracted campaigns in Africa would tie down Allied colonial troops who might otherwise be sent to the European front.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': ""A number of African societies also expanded their defensive capabilities through internal military innovations.

Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially. In several cases African states reacted violently to the first European encroachments despite the overwhelming military advantage which the enemy enjoyed. Thus, the Chewa leader Mwase Kasungu led his people in a futile effort against the British, ultimately committing suicide in 1896 rather than capitulating.$^{11}$ At about the same time the Bihe of Angola ambushed a colonial force seeking to establish interior posts which would cut through their homelands, and the Humbe, to the south, attacked a Portuguese force after Lisbon refused to pay rent for the right to maintain a small fort within its borders.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

The beginning of the construction of the Oubangui network (AEF) dated from the war and, by 1926, 4200 km had been completed. However, only a few vehicles were seen using it and most of them were exclusively commercial. There were less than 1000 vehicles in 1930,1500 in 1931 and only 2850 in 1945, 600 of which were for tourism. 62 AOF, especially, made up for its railway deficiencies with roads.

To be sure, a certain number of territories offered a wide range of products: cotton, coffee, sugar cane, sisal and maize in Angola; coconuts, groundnuts and rice in Mozambique; wood in Gabon and the Ivory Coast; and bananas in Guinea. But exports continued to be based almost exclusively on minerals and oil-yielding plants. Few territories were as favourably situated as the Belgian Congo, whose improvement was based, at best, on two or three groups of products which, at least, were already partially processed.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 290, 'article_title': 'Renewal of the Ashantee War', 'full_section_title': 'Renewal of the Ashantee War', 'last_edit_date': '12-14-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': 'The military department of this Coast are actively preparing to take the field against the King of Ashantee, who, about a few months ago, invaded our Protectorate.

It was stated that sailors from the three men-of-war which were lying off Cape Coast would garrison the forts at Cape Coast, Anamaboe, and Accra. But from a more perfect information I am able to state that Colonel Conran, although desirous of availing himself of the services of the Navy, is, nevertheless, greatly opposed to the forts being placed entirely in their hands, as was the case during last year's expedition. His reasons are perfectly in harmony with existing circumstances; for it cannot be supposed that the Navy on shore will take the same care and interest in preserving certain necessaries which will be required by the soldiers on their return from the campaign as soldiers themselves would do if left in the forts. The Colonel takes very great care of his men, and attends personally to the minutest detail of their comfort. Should, therefore, the necessity of the service require the landing of marines or sailors, it is supposed that an officer of superior rank in the Army will be detached from the camp to remain at Cape Coast Castle. Again, from the information which I have obtained from a source which is beyond a doubt, it is stated that the head of the Government here has received positive orders not to act on the offensive, but to dispose the troops in such a manner as to prevent any further invasion of the Protectorate by the Ashantees. There was a report lately circulated that the army of the King of Ashantee was on the move, and the disposition of our troops (the preliminary order of which, by the favour of a friend, I was able to forward you by last mail*), must reflect credit on the chief of the army at this command.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor has rendered every assistance in his power to the military.

Adonko, chief of Krobo, offered the services of himself and tribe, and a reply was sent to the effect that he could come if he brought 1,000 carriers.\n\nThe attitude of the neighbouring tribes is, on the whole, very satisfactory, evidence of their friendliness being afforded by the numerous and substantial offers of help which they made to the British authorities.\n\nMajor Baden-Powell and his force of 400 Elmina and Krobo scouts arrived at the Prahsu on Dec. 21. He has received orders to cross the Prah and clear the bush round the villages of Tobiassi, Esaman, Kuma, Fumsu, and Akusirem, and place them in a state of defence, so that when the troops advance, the stores now on their way to the front may safely be warehoused. These four villages are about six miles apart, Akusirem, the farthest north, being some twenty-five miles from Prahsu. At the same time it was announced that the Adansi scouts, who were sent across the Prah, were ordered to place pickets along the fourteen miles of road between Atobiassi, about a dozen miles north-west of Akusirem, and Dadiassi, a considerable village in the bush eight miles to the east of the road to Coomassie, thence to keep a close watch on the movements of the Ashantees.\n\nMajor Baden-Powell’s rapid march to the front is of some significance, as showing that the preparations for the advance of the force are not to be delayed by negotiations with King Prempeh.\n\nCaptain G. E. Benson, R.A., started on Dec. 21 for Prahsu, to take over the command of the Artillery. He has with him two Maxim guns, four rockets, and eight 7-pr. guns. Six of the 7-pr. guns will be taken on in advance, but the other two will be left at Prahsu. It has been decided to send guns on with the advance guard, as the Ashantees are in great dread of artillery. Some question has arisen, however, as to the advisability of taking rockets into the bush, as they might, by rebounding, prove dangerous to the force employing them.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN INTERVIEW WITH MR.

At present, on the Upper Congo, Europeans have to content themselves with living in wattled huts or mud forts, roofed over with straw and grass, and there is, of course, great danger from fire. By means of the railway the State could at once transport about a dozen iron stations; and there would soon be erected houses, churches, and schools, all of iron. Then the native chiefs, seeing what the Europeans were doing, would build iron houses, and would likewise require iron warehouses for their goods. The Chief of Kintamo, for instance, already keeps all his goods in iron boxes; while the Chiefs of Old Calabar live in iron houses which have cost from £1,000 to £3,500 each. Then, again, there would be many steamers to be transported in sections, to be put together on the upper side of the cataracts. On the Upper Congo there are at present only seven steamers, mostly steam launches, but to carry on the enormous trade of the 7,000 miles of navigable waterway of the Upper Congo, large and swift steamers will be required, capable of stowing cargo and carrying passengers in comfort. Again, there would be a large trade in timber, and saw-mills would be required to cut it up, which mills would have to be taken up country by railway. Enormous quantities of powder and large numbers of flint-lock guns would also be in demand. All this is without counting the almost limitless trade to be done in cloth goods. I should say that within a reasonable number of years after the making of the railway there would be a trade of about £10,000,000 annually with the natives of the Upper Congo—all in barter.""\n\nPausing here, Mr. Stanley went on to say that there was a sentimental side to the whole question which was worthy of reflection. ""We have been enabled,"" he continued, ""with our own modest enterprise to secure something like 1,000 carriers a month to serve us in a country that, when I began work there, absolutely refused to have anything to do with us. Already we have some 400 native soldiers—all of which proves that the natives are friendly and willing to lend their services to the white man for his purposes. When the State can better afford it—which will be not long after the railway is finished—it will be able to enlist 3,000 or 4,000 native soldiers for the protection of the country against the slave-traders. Those stations which are to-day so modest and unoffending, and dare not take arms in their hands against the organized slave-traders, will, in a few months only after the opening of the railway, be in a position to take the offensive and absolutely prevent them from ever setting foot in the Congo State.""\n\n""That indeed would be worth working for,"" I remarked.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ITEMS OF WEST AFRICAN NEWS', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The victory of the British had a most salutary effect in all the districts around.—We are glad to learn that the Lagos Railway is being pushed on very energetically, and about ten miles of the line completed, and an engine and waggons are running.—Accra was left by the Bathurst on March 5.

So shifting is the bar that the entrance varies every few weeks, and at times small surf boats go aground when entering. The French are now making arrangements with the Belgians for the conveyance of their goods up the Congo on the Congo Free State Railway, whence they will be taken across country to the French centre of Brazzaville.

The original concessions have been greatly extended, the sphere of the Company now reaching from the German boundary on the south to the Jub river on the north, and from the coast to the Upper Nile basin in the interior. That is the sphere within which the Company is free to develop and establish its influence without interference from any other Power. In judging of the progress made it should be remembered that it is in a very different position from the sister company on the south of the Zambesi. The hindrances in the shape of climate, want of easy routes, hostile Arab slavers, and turbulent populations, add to the difficulties; as does the proximity of Germans with their irritating methods towards the natives. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made. The port of Mombasa has been improved; a European town is growing up on the old site; a railway towards the interior has been begun; agents are established at all the chief ports; regular communications with these have been established; routes have been laid down as far as Uganda, while half-way a fortified post and trade depot has been built. The friendship of the natives has been quietly secured. Experiments in planting timber and in testing the suitability of other cultures have been carried out. A fair estimate has been obtained of the value of the Sabaki river as a trade route and a source of water supply, as also of the areas of land suitable for pasture and agriculture, and these estimates have been encouraging. The value of the Tana river as a trade route has been proved; this river leads direct to some of the richest parts of the Company's territories. British influence over Uganda and Usogo has been secured. In short, the Company has done much to establish trade, to render the region between the coast and the lake secure, to ascertain its industrial capacities, to abolish slavery, and to promote civilisation. Had Lord Salisbury seen his way to carry the vote for a subsidy to promote the construction of a railway to the lake, progress would have gone on at a tenfold rate, and the slave trade would have been doomed.

In this they will be assisted by the English-speaking negro traders, who, travelling from Sierra Leone, Bathurst, and Lagos, have had so much to do in introducing English goods into the interior. While land carriage remains difficult and expensive, on account of the want of proper vehicles, roads, and beasts of burden, the rivers and lagoons will continue to be used wherever practicable by the canoes and small schooners which, with a few steamers on the Niger, have up to the present time conveyed European goods from the coast.

But little difficulty usually marks the voyage of the British vessel, and in most cases the landing of the goods is safely accomplished. It is the negro trader who receives, as a sort of middleman, the European merchandise which he has to sell on the spot, or transfer into the interior, who has to encounter a host of difficulties arising from the barbarous character of the country and the tribal jealousies which prevail. Hence, rather than encounter the danger of loss through the absurd country customs characteristic of many parts, the exacting demands made by petty chieftains in others, and the physical difficulties on land and water, the English-speaking negro confines his commercial operations to those rivers where he is tolerably sure of securing protection, because of treaties made between the English colonial governors and the native chieftains. If he goes beyond treaty ground, as he sometimes does, he may encounter loss, as the colonial authority is powerless to secure compensation without the exhibition of force. The colonial trader living beyond the English territorial boundaries connects the British merchant with the inland caravan traffic.

Colonel Paris presided, and there was a large attendance of members and others interested. Commander Cameron, who, on rising, was loudly applauded, said: What he wished to speak about was the commerce of Africa, and what would come out of the Berlin Conference, and other events which were now happening; for the Conference could not fail to be of great importance to British trade. Tropical Africa, except in a few cases, on the shores of great water-ways, was scarcely known. From the interior the difficulties of transport prevented any profit except on the most valuable products. The first idea of the trader seemed ivory. India-rubber was coming into use, and before he left the West Coast over £20,000 worth had been exported from Zanzibar in one year. Many valuable gums and spices were found in Central Africa. Africa was to all appearance, until a few years ago, the happy hunting ground of Englishmen; it was only those who voyaged who could really compete with us. Now all these things were changed, and on every side they saw a scramble for Africa. It was our duty to know as much as possible about the resources of this continent, and how the future of Africa was to be controlled by the Congo Free State, which promised to be the outcome of the Berlin Conference. Very great results were to be expected, and he might mention that, north-east of Victoria Nyanza, there was a plateau which might be colonized by Europeans, and whence trade might be put into some of the great producing centres of Africa. The trade of the Arab at Zanzibar was carried out by a system of advance. On the west coast there was a trade carried on by a few Europeans. In the last century the Portuguese had an enormous trade up the Zambesi, and in Zumbo Town there were the ruins of a cathedral and a university which had at one time 370 students. There were two other towns of equal importance. The great difficulty in this trade was the climate. At a conference in Brussels in 1876, the idea of an International Association was sketched, and the King of the Belgians had set himself steadfastly to work to further this great idea of promoting the civilization of the ""Dark Continent."" Nearly all the people of Africa were traders; the cultivation of the soil was relegated to the women. At Nyanza there were enormous assemblies of people, some of whom came to market 15 or 20 miles, travelling against the current of the Congo. From this locality he had brought home nutmegs that were of the greatest use in commerce. From the same region there came wild coffee. There were enormous districts where any amount of rice could be grown; you had only to ""scratch the earth,"" and it smiled at you. At some of these interior stations whole caravans were supplied by small villages with wheat sufficient for a week\'s journey. The people of those villages were able to produce for from ten to twelve times their number with scarcely any labour. On the Niger we had utilized water traffic, and the Congo had a number of miles of water carriage which could be utilized. There was, at the same time, the great difficulty of getting from the coast to this system on the Congo. Various schemes had been proposed to connect Stanley Pool with the Congo by railway, and he believed that after the settlement of the dispute between France and the International Association, the French would construct a railway to Stanley Pool, or the Association from the left bank of the Congo, and they would then be able to have instant communication with the centre of Africa. Further south, the Portuguese were beginning to wake up to the value of their territories. They were now making contracts to construct a railway into the interior. It was their duty as Englishmen to look after that scheme. The region he was speaking of produced ivory, gum, cotton, and spices. The Powers at the Berlin Conference had recognized the International Association as practically a sovereign State. What they must strongly insist upon was free trade, and permission to reside and trade in the Free State. Another point was as to the mode in which future annexations were to be made. Annexations had been going on rather fast lately, and the Conference agreement was to the effect that when a place was annexed notice was to be sent to the other countries, and that people trading at such a place were to continue trading under the same guarantees as formerly. He fancied that would be simply that there might be equal rights to all nations, and people already trading in places which had no European sovereign might find their positions injured by annexation on the part of European Powers. In this matter, also, he thought that great care had to be exercised. Then they had to think of the great trade which used to pass down Egypt from the Upper Nile. The Suakin and Berber Railway was contracted for at one time by Ismail Pasha, but he was compelled to give up the idea. If that railway had been built, we should have had none of the difficulties in the Soudan which we had at present. He mentioned as a sign of the times that an Ambassador from Timbuctoo was at Paris treating with the President of the French Republic. We had the trade of the Lower Niger in our hands, but in the Upper Niger a great portion of the trade might be diverted from us if the proposed railway were completed. There was one thing which he must say, and that was that if we wanted outlets for our goods we must send proper and suitable goods for the people. The establishment of the Congo Free State would prove a benefit to English trade, but we must watch the constitution of that State, and, if there were any objectionable features in it, get them removed. In conclusion, Commander Cameron remarked that in a very large portion of Africa cotton of very good quality grew. He had specimens at home of cotton goods which had been made by the natives in the interior, and he believed that, as communication improved they would see cargoes of cotton coming to Liverpool from Central Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V. Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Most Recent Action of the African-Aid Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Chairman of the African-Aid Society has lately been urging especially on Her Majesty's Government, on behalf of the Society, the following among other measures, as requiring immediate decision and action upon the part of this country:—\n\nThe reoccupation of the Fort of Quittah.

The space within the walls is usually extensive, and interspersed with cultivated fields, rendering it difficult to estimate the population. In the towns markets are held every two or three days, and in some places daily, and attended by numbers from neighboring villages, and although the total of their dealings would appear trifling, still there is everywhere shown a strong love of trade. At these markets are exposed for sale produce of all kinds, besides native and European wares. Cotton and indigo are cultivated, and there is an extensive manufacture of cotton cloth, noted for its quality and the durability of the dye, which finds a ready market among the negroes of Brazil. Besides cloths, there are manufactures of saddlery, cushions, &c. The art of smelting metals is understood, and gold chains and ornaments are manufactured with taste and skill. The trade of the blacksmith is everywhere plied. At the 1851 Exhibition specimens of native copper ware, tinned inside, were exhibited. European goods are brought from Tripoli and Morocco, and are estimated to treble in value by the time they reach Kano, the great centre of trade. Goods find their way in limited quantities from the coast, but are subject to heavy exactions as they pass along. The goods are transported by caravan in packages varying from 60lb. to 100lb. on the heads of slaves, except where the rivers afford water transport. Some of the canoes on the Niger approaching the sea are large enough to convey upwards of 100 people.

At present, the three weeks taken by even the fastest postal communication is a serious drawback to the commerce of Lagos, Sierra Leone, and the other West African ports, and the proposed cable will do much to simplify and develop commercial relations between Great Britain and the ports and towns in her West Coast possessions. Further south, we have the still more important district of the Congo. Mr. H. M. Stanley, than whom no greater authority upon the subject exists, seems never to tire of pointing out the advantages which must result from the formation of new markets in the Congo territory; and the decision of the European Powers at the Berlin Conference that Free Trade principles should be established at least for a term of years in the territory of the African International Association will do much towards the development of trade with parts not hitherto reached by commerce.

Last year, the imports into this district amounted to considerably over £880,000, and the exports to nearly £2,000,000—so that in round numbers the present trade may be roughly estimated at between two and a-half and three million pounds per annum. Though only just formed, the British Congo Company (Limited) will scarcely commence as an entirely new undertaking, for, in order to avoid the delays and disadvantages inseparable from an entirely new business, a provisional agreement has been made with the Congo and Central African Company (Limited), of Liverpool, which possesses several factories and stations along the river, and at Ambriz and Ambrizette on the coast, by which the Congo and Central African Company agrees to transfer its stations, factories, and buildings, stores and plant, its steamers, cargo, surf and other boats, to this Company at a valuation, to be paid for by fully paid-up shares in this Company, and to sell its stock of goods, merchandise, and produce to this Company at cost price. No payment will be made for goodwill, the shareholders in that Company being satisfied that they will make a larger profit by becoming interested in a more powerfully-constituted undertaking. This agreement will provide the new Company at once with a favourable basis for its operations, and enable it to enter immediately upon a profitable business in the Lower Congo district, and give great facilities for opening up trade as communications with the Upper Congo are established. Thus we are assured of a speedy increase of an already existing trade in the districts placed under the International African Association, and the British Congo Company (Limited), by possessing stations upon the coast as well as along the course of the river, will be well prepared to participate in the trade which is constantly developing among the peoples in the interior."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The trading operations of Europeans in West Africa are carried on after the following manner: The trader selects a site suitable—generally by the side of a river or creek, or along the seashore—and comes to terms with the owner of the soil or the native chief of the district for the leasing of the land, the natives retaining a dislike to alienating any part of their country.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

Operating from its coastal possessions on the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in Nigeria, Britain halted effectively French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887. Both Brass and Bini were duly con› quered by the end of the century. By 1900, British supremacy in southern Nigeria was more or less assured. The effective occupation of Igboland and some other areas of the eastern hinterland, however, were not accom› plished until the first two decades of this century. To the north, British conquest was accomplished from Nupe, where - by 1895 - George Goldie's Royal Niger Company exercised influence from Lokoja to the sea. Ilorin was occupied in 1897; and after the establishment of the West African Frontier Force in 1898 the Sokoto sultanate was conquered by Lugard in 1902.\nIn North Africa, Britain, already in a commanding position in Egypt, waited until 1896 when the reconquest of the Sudan was authorized. This was achieved in 1898 with savage and unnecessary bloodshed. Over 20000 Sudanese, including their leader, Khalifa 'Abdallah, died in battle.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

When King Leopold called an international conference in Brussels in 1876 'to discuss methods of peaceful and co- operative action to develop legitimate commerce and attack the slave trade',$^{62}$ the rivalry was already appearing on the surface. The international conference eventually broke up into jealous national sub-committees and Leopold went ahead with establishing his personal empire in the Congo.

For the British the action was justified because of the strategic position of Egypt (with the Suez Canal and the Nile) for British interests in India and East Africa, although East Africa was considered of less importance. But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R. E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Around the turn of the century Barue, Tawara, Tonga and other Shona religious spirit mediums (svikiro) (see Fig. 8.1) provided divinely inspired medicines to neutralize the European weapons and turn their bullets into water. 10 Despite the common commitment of some of the Africans to prevent foreign rule and to acquire modern weapons, the immediate tactics they employed varied substantially.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'And as will be seen in many of the following chapters, religion was indeed one of the weapons used against colonialism. Moreover, many African rulers had been able to build empires of varying size only a couple of decades back, and some were still in the process of expanding or reviving their kingdoms. Many of them had been able to defend their sovereignties with the support of their people using traditional weapons and tactics. Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy. As we shall see below, in 1889, while Cecil Rhodes was preparing to occupy the land of the Ndebele, their king, Lobengula, dispatched a delegation to London to see Queen Victoria; and while the British invading army was marching towards Kumasi in 1896 to seize Prempeh five years after he had turned down the British offer of protection, he dispatched a powerful diplomatic mission to Queen Victoria. As seen above, Menelik addressed a similar appeal to the same monarch as well as to other European heads of state.\nIt is also obvious from some of the quotations above that many African rulers did in fact welcome the new changes that were steadily being intro› duced from the third decade of the nineteenth century since these changes had hitherto posed no threat to their sovereignty and independence. In West Africa, for instance, thanks to the activities of the missionaries, Fourah Bay College had been founded as early as 1827 in Sierra Leone, while elementary schools and a secondary school each in the Gold Coast and Nigeria had been established by the 1870s. Indeed, a call for the establish› ment of a university in West Africa by the Caribbean-born pan-Africanist, Edward Wilmot Blyden had already gone out. As early as 1887 some of the wealthy Africans had even begun to send their children to Europe for further education and professional training and some of them had returned to the Gold Coast as fully qualified barristers and doctors.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'It will be seen from these chapters that the view that Africans received the invading soldiers with elation and quickly accepted colonial rule is not borne out by the available evidence. In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 316, 'article_title': 'Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '01-14-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I did not write by last mail, having nothing of very great importance to communicate.

The Victor Emmanuel, hospital ship, is in a forward state of preparation.\n\n**November 5.**—A monster distilling apparatus, consisting of a set of cisterns and about 4,000 feet of galvanized iron pipe, for distilling and condensing sea, marsh, and bush water, so as to make them useful for drinking purposes, are being sent out to the Gold Coast from Woolwich, for use either at Cape Coast Castle or at some other station, as the commander of the expedition may direct. The largest of these cisterns will contain about 6,000 gallons, and it has been stowed away in the fore-hold of ""Transport No. 5,"" as the Joseph Dodds is officially called. The quantity of provisions sent out in this ship is enormous. Ten heavily-loaded lighters have come from Deptford Victualling-yard alone, and have discharged, or are discharging, their cargoes into the spacious holds of the vessel. These provisions are of various kinds. One large load consisted of 1,400 cases of preserved mutton, and 500 casks of salt pork; another consisted of 2,000 kegs of rice; and altogether it is estimated that the ship will carry out food enough to feed an army of 10,000 men for two or three months. Besides ordinary provisions, several van-loads of medical comforts arrived yesterday at Woolwich, and were put on board the same ship. They consisted of jams and jellies, potted fruits, preserved meats, and other delicacies, for the use of the sick and wounded in the hospitals, with large quantities of wine and bottled beer.\n\n**November 7.**—The 28th Company of Royal Engineers are to embark in the Himalaya, troop-ship, for Cape Coast, under the command of Captain R. O. Jones. They are to be employed in laying down the railway. Mules are to be purchased at Madeira, and sent down to Cape Coast for transport service; several hundred sets of pack saddles, &c., are now preparing for shipment.

She is the thirteenth of the hired transports engaged in the expedition, and a considerable quantity of stores has been sent out in the ships regularly trading between England and Africa, without reckoning the cargo of Her Majesty's ship Dromedary and the troop-ships. This week 150 tons of meat were sent from the Victualling-yard, Deptford, to Liverpool, for transport to Captain Glover, at Accra, by private ships, and similar consignments are going off every week. Cases of stores for the next ship are already accumulating at Woolwich and Deptford. At the former place, five additional surf-boats and two more hospital-boats arrived yesterday from the builders' yard at Limehouse, from whence two more only of the former are to be delivered to make four dozen. These boats are contrived on a novel plan, and those which were sent out early are said to have answered admirably, the cargo of the Bonny having been landed by them in four days, which was quick work. There are ten surf-boats and four hospital-boats yet remaining to be sent out, six of the whole number of surf-boats being for the Admiralty, and the other forty-two for the use of the army. At the clothing factory, Pimlico, the work-people are still very busy making the Ashanti uniform, but nothing is yet said about any additional troops being forwarded to Africa. The 2nd Battalion of the 4th King's Own, and some other regiments which have been mentioned, have, however, on the merest rumour, begun to make preparations for departure, and in some cases all leave has been stopped, and the officers who were away called in, lest a sudden order should arrive and find them not ready.

Shortly after half-past nine the special corps paraded with the detachment of Royal Engineers. The district Headquarter Staff had just assembled when the Duke of Connaught arrived, with whom were the Duchess of Connaught and Prince and Princess Henry of Battenburg. An inspection having been made, the Duke of Connaught addressed the troops. He wished them God-speed and a happy return. He reminded them that they had been selected from distinguished regiments, and as a corps he hoped they would uphold the honour and integrity of the British Army. He urged upon them the necessity of strict obedience to the orders of their officers, and said that the one great thing they had to guard against was night attack. He did not doubt that they all hoped to have a chance of discharging their carbines, and felt sure that they would give a good account of themselves. They must be very careful about night surprises, be steady, and always be on the alert. In wishing them good-bye he hoped that they would have a pleasant voyage, good health, and safe return. On the same day Lord Wolseley inspected the hospital and transport ship Coromandel and the forces she is to convey to Accra.

Preparations for the expedition are otherwise well advanced. The rest-camps for the troops and the field telegraphs between Cape Coast Castle and Prahsu had been completed, and a detachment of engineers started immediately to examine the rest huts on the road and inspect the bridge over the river at Prahsu. Strong guards of Houssas have been stationed along the frontier, all the Houssas force being employed in lining the borders, with the exception of the men retained to guard the towns. Natives come down to the coast in large numbers, and the gold mines in the Wassaw country have been closed, as the Fanti miners, in dread of the Ashantees, are leaving their work to seek protection.

At Lagos the Admiralty has hitherto supplied the service of two gun-boats, which have been employed in the navigation of the lagoons, and in communicating with vessels outside the entrance.\n\nFrom the shallowness of the water of the lagoons it is necessary that the vessel employed in their navigation should have a very light draft of water, whilst, for going outside, the heavy sea that prevails on the bar necessitates the employment of a larger and deeper steamer.\n\nAlthough two vessels are thus required for the use of the settlement, it would be quite possible to dispense with the services of the larger, except at particular periods; for example, when the arrival of the mail, men-of-war, or store-ships, &c., was expected; but during these intervals she might proceed to the Gold Coast, and afford the Governor of that settlement an opportunity of visiting some of his numerous out-stations. As the distance between the two colonies is but three hundred miles, there would be plenty of time to allow of her performing this service at frequent intervals, without prejudice to her ordinary duties at Lagos.\n\nIt appears from the army estimates for the present year that the proposed military expenditure on the four settlements amounts to £27,897, and that this provides for an effective force of two regiments of black troops, or about 1,800 men.\n\nIt has been already stated that the condition of affairs on the Gold Coast and Lagos is such as to warrant the reduction of the force allotted for their occupation one-half, or by half a regiment; this should effect a corresponding diminution of one-fourth in the amount of the estimate, but so much of this expenditure is caused by the large establishment of staff, which the exigencies of the climate appear to render necessary, that it will not effect anything like this saving.\n\nThe force formerly employed on the coast averaged about 1,000 men, and there seems no reason to suppose that it might not be at once reduced to this amount without exposing the settlements to any risk; further reductions are, however, needed to bring the charge for their defence within reasonable limits, and the readiest mode of effecting this is to be found in the extension to the other settlements, so far as their circumstances warrant, of the system already successfully tried at Lagos, the employment of an armed police force of the natives known as houssas, as auxiliaries to, or even substitutes for, regular soldiers.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment. It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the recent meeting of the members of the British Association, in the Geographical Section, Major Darwin, the Chairman, had a good deal to say about the development of Central Africa by means of railways. The great barrier, Major Darwin said, to the progress of colonisation was the belt of fever-stricken forest near the coast; and the problem was how to cross those malarial regions quickly into the healthy interior, where the higher type of Native was to be found. The slave-raiding in the interior also tended to impede progress; and the opening up of main trunk lines of communication would be the most effective means of counteracting the slave trade. To develop the traffic along the rivers and in the lakes was the first stage in the commercial evolution of a continent like Africa. But the rivers were obstructed by cataracts, and the construction of railways must, therefore, be the second stage. Taking the East Coast first, the first region to attract attention was the valley of the Nile and parts of the Central Soudan. The sooner this region was connected with the civilised world the better, and it was only as to the method of opening it up and as to who was to undertake the work that any question would arise. Below Berber the Nile was interrupted by cataracts for several hundred miles, while above that town it was navigable for 1,400 miles. The importance of a railway from Suakim to Berber was thus evident, and there was perhaps only one other place in Africa where an equal expenditure would open up such a large extent of country to European trade. Passing further south, the lines of communication next considered were those leading to the Victoria Nyanza, and on to the regions lying north and west of the lake. Two routes for railways had been proposed, one running through the British and the other through the German sphere of influence. The German route would be shorter, but the British line would open up more country to the east suitable for prolonged residence by white men. If the Germans wished to launch out on great railway projects in Africa, let them make a line from the south end of Lake Tanganyika to the northern end of Lake Nyassa, and thence on to the coast. Such a line of communication would be most valuable in putting an end to the slave trade, for it would erect a great barrier across the roads traversed by the raiders. Further south they came to the Zambesi River. This line had many faults. The whole valley was unhealthy, and white men would prefer a route which would bring them to high land more quickly. The Upper Zambesi valley was likely to be more attractive to white men. The Beira Railway would form a much better line of communication to this region than the river itself. The Congo afforded a grand opportunity of opening up the interior. From the coast there was 150 miles of navigable waterway, and afterwards there were 200 miles of cataracts, round which a railway was being made. From Stanley Pool there were 7,000 miles of navigable waterway, so they might predict a grand future for this route to the interior. The next great navigable waterway met with was the Niger. There was no area of equal size so densely inhabited, or where trade offered greater inducement to open up a commercial route. Little had to be done in this respect, for the Niger was navigable for light draught steamers 550 miles from the sea. The only drawback was the unhealthy nature of the coast districts which had to be traversed. At Lagos, a survey of a railway running in the direction of Rabba had been made, the objective being the towns of Abeokuta and Ibadan; and surveys had also been made for a railway to connect either Kormantin or Apam with Insuian. It was possible that those who selected this route were too much influenced by a desire to reach Coomassie, which was a political rather than a commercial centre. It was to be hoped that the merits of a line from Accra to Odumase would be considered before it was too late. For connecting the Upper Niger with the coast, the best commercial route would be a line running in a north-easterly direction to the Upper Niger. Such a line would connect the longest stretch of navigable waterway in this region with the best harbour on the coast. But the fact that it crossed the Anglo-French boundary was a bar to this project at present. The proposal to connect Algeria with the Upper Niger would be simple madness. The idea was thus to unite the French spheres of influence, but he was sure the French would not waste their money on such schemes. Concluding, the President said his object had been to prove that, notwithstanding the strides geography had made in past years, there was yet an immense amount of work ready for anyone who would undertake it.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of Tropical Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. H. H. Johnston said ever since the end of last century the attention of the British had been given to the opening up of tropical Africa. It was, however, directed by the instinct of commercial expansion and the desire of planting among the natives our ideas of religion and philanthropy. On many occasions the Government had disavowed any intention of political aggrandisement. It was only lately that we could thank those who held the reins of Government for the position we now occupied as an African Power. Whatever had been done previously had been accomplished by traders and missionaries. This country was the first to send out a surveying expedition to the Congo, and yet we were ready to give in once to the partition of its territory among various European countries. It was the same after a magnificent campaign in Ashantee and Abyssinia. Millions of money had been spent and brave men had lost their lives from 1799 to 1890 to practically no purpose. But it was querulous to make complaints about what had been done in view of what had recently occurred. The result of Lord Salisbury\'s action in respect of African affairs would be of stupendous import, and the possession of such territory was a matter of great moment, for it was a fact that nowhere did Englishmen and their civilising work thrive so well as they did under conditions of existence and regulations made by themselves. Let other countries have their fair share of the Dark Continent as a theatre for their expansion, and let England now set herself to the duty of developing the resources of those lands which she had secured. There were two ways in which Africa might be governed under the British flag. One was by chartered companies, and the other by direct Imperial rule; and it would almost seem better if Africa were always governed direct, in some form or other of Imperial Government, though this was not always practically possible. A Parliament always grumbled over the cost to the Exchequer of such a place as Bechuanaland was not likely to vote money in an extension of such sway. The majority of men sent to Parliament were badly instructed in geography, and were indifferent to the interests of Great Britain, and the object of some of them seemed to be to hinder the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire. It was well, therefore, that there should be conferred upon the great administrating companies rights and privileges in return for the work they did and the money they were called upon to expend. He was thankful that such companies were formed to make their experiments in empire-founding. Yet, if a considerable amount of money, say £250,000 a year, were expended imperially in opening up and governing Africa, what an immense return it would make, and what an effect it would have upon the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, London, and other places. Africa would take their hardware, cotton goods, agricultural implements, sewing machines, knives, needles, steel railways, tin provisions, coals, pianos, harmoniums, fireworks, and other products, which would have an ever-widening consumption. In return there would be a most profitable exchange. Great as our Indian Empire was, it was only able to employ half of the well-conducted British youth. Africa would find employment for the remainder if a similar Government service were inaugurated there, and he did not think that with the changes which would be effected by the inauguration of the British, Africa would be a bit more unhealthy than India. But Africa should not be a theatre for the failures of life here—of the bankrupt, the ne\'er-do-weels, and such like. Men should be trained for the work, as they were in China and elsewhere. To succeed in Africa, a man must have a liking for the place, he must be enthusiastic in his work, and ready to bear up against the monotony which prevailed everywhere in an uncivilised land. He must be abstemious and self-denying; there must be no gluttony, or high living. Reviewing the wealth of Africa, he enumerated its valuable wild beasts, which he would like to see preserved to give colour to our existence, as well as for their intrinsic worth. Adverting to the vegetable products of the tropical regions he pointed out that they were all of commercial value, and that with the establishing of a settled government, and the introduction of systematic cultivation, they might be extended almost indefinitely. As for rubber, indigo, gums, reeds, etc., there was at present a great export, while cotton might be grown profitably to an enormous extent. The palm oil trade led to the settlement of the ""oil rivers,"" which from a swamp had been transformed into a comparatively healthy residential and commercial district. Besides these kinds of produce, ranging from £10 to £25 per ton, there were dyewoods and forests of timber of most valuable kind. Gold was found running all the way up the continent from the south, at any rate as far as Darfur and the Soudan, and diagonally westwards into the Niger basins. Silver was found in the western portions of the continent in conjunction with antimony, and as the latter metal had been found in other parts, it was reasonable to suppose that silver would be found also. Copper was found in South Central Africa, and iron was found in abundance, while good coal had been discovered on the shores of Lake Nyassa and the Zambesi, as well as other places. He need scarcely allude to the diamond fields, but it was certain that other precious stones—topazes, opals, &c.—were found in certain districts. What he had named were only a small portion of the products of these regions, and many more were to be discovered and utilised.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CAPTAIN CAMERON, R.N., ON AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Balloon Society, on July 18, a lecture was delivered by Captain V. Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area.

The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains.

The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade.

They also used the heavy artillery of naval forces. As Laroui has pointed out, even motor vehicles and aeroplanes62 were used in the later campaigns. It is significant that the two African leaders who were able to inflict some defeats on the Europeans, Samori and Menelik, managed to obtain some of these up-to-date weapons. But in the end even Samori too was overpowered by the French. The overwhelming superiority that Europe enjoyed over Africa is summed up succinctly in Hilaire Belloc's famous couplet already quoted in Chapter 1.\nIn view of these economic, political and above all military and techno¬ logical advantages enjoyed by European powers over African polities, the contest was a most uneven one and it is not at all surprising that the former could vanquish the latter with such relative ease.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

African resistance varied in accordance with the nature of the society and in accordance with how each community perceived the external threat to its sovereignty. '$^{s}$ What differed was the extent or otherwise of resistance. As Ochieng puts it, 'practically everywhere in Kenya the imposition of colonial rule was resisted. Better armed and employing groups of mercenaries, the British imposed their authority only by violence'. 16 On the coast, the Mazrui family resisted the take-over by the IBEAC. This resistance was led by Mbaruk bin Rashid who organized hit-and-run warfare against the superior weapons of the British forces. It took reinforce› ments of Indian troops brought in by the British to defeat him. He fled Tanganyika, only to fall into the hands of the Germans. The Mazrui resistance came about as a result of British attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the coastal societies. After the Mazrui family had settled in Takarungu on the Kenya coast, they had gradually begun to extend their influence to many parts of the coast. They acquired, for example, the monopoly of buying grain from the Mijikenda people along the coast and had thus come to control the sale of food crops on the coast. The monopoly was resisted by the Giriama between 1877 and 1883 when war broke out between the two groups. The Mazrui were defeated. There› after, they had come to some understanding with the Giriama whereupon the two communities became trading partners. The coming of the British interfered with this arrangement as well as the internal organization of the Mazrui society, providing one reason why the Mazrui resisted the imposition of British rule.\nWhen in 1895, the Wali Takarungu died, the IBEAC chose their local friend to succeed him instead of Mbaruk who had a better claim to the throne but was known not to favour the British presence.$^{17}$ It was for this reason that Mbaruk sought to drive the British away from the coast by force."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in East Africa, i880-1914', 'section_title': 'The European Scramble for East Africa and the patterns of African resistance > The response in Uganda', 'content': ""Probably the greatest diplomat of all those who had to deal with the advent of imperialism in East Africa in the last decade of the nineteenth century was Mwanga, the Kabaka of Buganda, which had been declared a British Protectorate in 1894.

Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

It has a beautiful river, which swells considerably after a heavy fall of rain, and which alone gives life to the place. It is a most important and well-selected position for a depôt; it being on a hill, perfectly surrounded by lofty evergreen trees, as well as having an easy supply of good fresh water, at once gives to it that excellency which only a few places on the Gold Coast can boast of. The town being small, it is well adapted for building a stockade, in which a few rockets and field-pieces, with the rifles of the soldiers, will keep at bay any number of the Ashantees. But to prevent any further inroads of that powerful enemy on the protectorate territory, the occupation of Mansoo is insufficient. The aide-de-camp of his Excellency the Governor was, therefore, sent further on, to the Prah, to report on the adaptability of Prahsoo for the formation of a second and more advanced camp. His report is very favourable. The embankment at this side of the Prah is a great deal higher than at the Ashantee side; consequently, a few field pieces will be sufficient to prevent the crossing of any number of the Ashantees at that place, and well protect the advance of the army into the Ashantee frontier, should such an advance become necessary. Prahsoo, therefore, will be our next post, and I hope I shall hereafter be able to give you a full and perfect account of it, as I intend, please God, to go up there.\n\nOn the 1st January, the 1st Battalion of the 1st Division of the Army of Observation, commanded by Captain Mackay, arrived at Mansoo. On it devolves the arduous duty of clearing the bush and building up stockades. A better officer than Captain Mackay, I think, could not possibly be found to superintend such a work. He attends personally to it, and directs the performance of every work by the men, and, therefore, everything is properly done. The 2nd Battalion of the 1st Division will arrive at Mansoo in the course of a few days.\n\nBefore the commencement of the late campaign the King of Ashantee sent messengers to Attah, King of Eastern Akim, asking him not to molest his army whilst crossing the Prah, as he had sent it down to take Ajman's head. These men were sent as prisoners to the King of Accra. They were subsequently taken on board the Rattlesnake, about six months ago, on a cruise to different parts of the Coast, and were landed the other day at Cape Coast Castle.

Nothing has been done like this since Sir William Winniett sacrificed his life in October, 1850, in his expedition to Addah.\n\nGreat credit is due to all concerned in this affair. Immense good has been effected by a judicious display of physical force without the shedding of a drop of blood. Credit is due to the Civil Commandant and Captain Ness for not hesitating to take the responsibility of dealing promptly with the Ningos without waiting for orders from Accra, as well as for the manner in which they dealt with the matter at Ningo; the firmness of Captain Ness at a critical moment prevented the shedding of blood, and at the same time conduced to the success of the expedition. An officer who at a similar crisis actually fled—I say fled, and mean to use the word as it is understood in England—from his post, obtained his promotion for his flight. This was not very long ago. Captain Ness may possibly be overlooked, as there was no blood shed and no running away; but his services on this occasion ought never to be forgotten by this Government.\n\nMr. Elliott's arrangements for the comfort of the troops were excellent. The men lived better than if they had been in barracks. Luxuries were provided for them at every place they came to. There was no confusion, no mixing ammunition with provisions; everything was in its place. The medical department was equally well cared for by Dr. Eaton. In fact, under a man like Ness things could not have gone wrong. The management of details not immediately connected with the military was ably conducted by Mr. Bolton, who was assisted by Mr. R. Bannerman. The Administrator has been lucky in having such men to carry out his orders. On the other hand, it must be admitted that unless they had been sure of his support they would not have acted as they did. Colonel Conran and Mr. Pine would have got no one to move a peg for them in this way. I think now that it will not be long before Mr. Usher becomes as convinced as I have always been that peace, in this part of the world at least, is easier brought about by a judicious use of armaments than by arguments.

The scene of the conflict is to the west of Lake Nyassa, in the country known as Angoniland, within the British Central African Protectorate; and a confederacy of slave-dealing chiefs seems to have been formed, with King Mwasigungu at its head, whose object was to dispute the right of the British to interfere with their man-hunting expeditions. Nobody can impute a shadow of bloodguiltiness in this matter to our representatives. Every effort appears to have been made by our Consul-General to come to terms with the barbarous potentate; but Mwasigungu rejected all offers, and actually declared war. No doubt he felt confident of beating the small force of Sikhs and Natives, who could be brought against him, and, as far as numerical superiority went, his confidence was not misplaced. In the actual conflict, Lieut. Alston and Captain Stewart, who commanded the Sikh contingent, had only 150 men under them, to which must be added a body of five thousand Natives. This little army marched into the country of the slave-dealers, and in three battles succeeded in utterly routing King Mwasigungu and the other chiefs, although they had a force of twenty thousand fighters. The danger of the enterprise can be gauged from the fact that two strong stockades had to be taken by assault, and Lieut. Alston is mentioned as having gallantly led the storming parties. Fifty towns were captured by the victorious British troops, and 600 prisoners, including 14 chiefs, fell into their hands. One of the latter, a notorious character, with the stain of past murders on his soul, was taken to the shores of Lake Nyassa, and there tried, condemned, and executed. The loss in the slavedealers\' army was great, while six of the Sikhs seem to have fallen on our side. The capture of ninety guns, and the re-opening of the trade routes to the Luapula river, are not the greatest advantages to be derived from this achievement. The prestige of the Arab slave-dealers will have received a blow in all the region between the Portuguese border and the Loangwa; while the ability of the British to make their Protectorate a reality will be forcibly impressed on the Native mind. Not only has the capital of the presumptuous monarch been captured, but a fort has been built there and garrisoned by Protectorate troops, so that there will be a standing pledge and symbol of our authority in the heart of the country. Thus gradually the tide of civilisation sweeps over the darkest places of the Dark Continent, and not for the first or the last time has British daring and enterprise brought succour to the slave. If the process of ""ransoming the African"" has to be effected by violent means, then it is satisfactory to find that a force under the British flag is capable of meeting four times its number of Arabs, and putting them to rout. In a victory of this description there is much to be proud of and nothing to regret, for it is a triumph of justice and mercy over base greed and cruelty.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Promotions, Honours, &c., for Services in the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'CAPTAIN ALEXANDER HERMAN ADAM GORDON.**\n\nA general order, issued by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, dated January 1, states that Lieutenant Alexander Herman Adam Gordon, of the 98th Regiment, is promoted to the rank of captain in the 84th Regiment, as a special recognition of his valuable services with the Houssas and other forces under his orders whilst operating against the Ashantees on the West Coast of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Naval Command on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In October of the present year, Commodore Sir William N.

One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes. It is well known that some of the most useful work of the Company has been done by their numerous coloured officials. These have, when opportunity offered, ...\n\nproved the capacity of their race, and amply justified the statemanlike policy of the Company in setting aside the absurd prejudices which have elsewhere hampered progress and civilisation.

The “Africa Order in Council” referred to, deals with all contingencies likely to arise, in minute detail. In a region like that of the Oil Rivers, one cannot expect law and order to be enforced in the same rigid manner as in Europe, or even in the Cape, or an old Crown colony. Much must be left to the Commissioner’s tact and discretion. A body of Haussas are now being enlisted for the police service, and in time we may hope that the law will reach well into the interior, and that free traffic will be carried on without the intervention of middlemen. The numerous creeks and rivers form useful waterways, though they are hotbeds of malaria. It will be the business of the Commissioner and his staff, moreover, to encourage and even carry on experiments in the way of introducing new cultures and new industries. Major MacDonald has been in communication with Kew and with Sir Alfred Moloney, who has done such good work in Lagos. He will take out with him a large supply of seeds of various kinds, and begin by establishing an experimental garden at Old Calabar.\n\nMajor MacDonald’s own head-quarters will be at Old Calabar, where there is some kind of Consular building. But, of course, he will be pretty constantly on the move. His Vice-Consuls will be stationed as follows: General Hammill on the Bonny River; Mr. T. A. Wall at Old Calabar; Captain H. L. Gallwey on the Benin River; Captain F. Synge on the Forcados; Captain MacDonald on the Brass River; Mr. W. Armstrong on the Opobo River. Each of them will, of course, exercise jurisdiction on his own river, but Major MacDonald will be in constant communication with them, and it is hoped that very soon all the rivers will be connected by telegraph. The treasurer of the Commissionership is Mr. J. F. Roberts, while Mr. Tanner is Major MacDonald’s private secretary. There are besides four Consular clerks—Mr. Steains, Mr. C. Harrison, Mr. F. Wilding, and Mr. G. Quilter. This is a large staff, but not too large for the many duties which will have to be performed, in a climate where it is hardly safe to stay for more than a year at a time. It is hoped that the Customs dues to be collected will defray the cost of administration. Of course, the whole arrangement is a compromise. But it is to be expected that in time, under Major Macdonald, the progress made will be such as to justify the taking over of the Oil Rivers as a Crown colony. British connexion with West Africa has had many vicissitudes. Our colonies have been abandoned; have been made over to companies; taken over by the Crown, and generally treated without any sort of continuity of policy. Now that we have put our hands to one of the richest commercial regions on the continent, it is to be hoped we shall persevere in a policy of gradual development.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-08-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_08_1891#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If the character, in a geographical sense, of the burning questions of the hour be analysed, it will be found that Africa and African interests engage the greater part of Englishmen\'s thoughts at the present moment. It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Anglo-French Situation in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Nov. 27, over forty officers and non-commissioned officers embarked on the steamer Volta for the Niger.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear.

It highlights the successful sacking of Kumasi in 1874 and the eventual subduing of the Asante in 1896 through diplomacy, without explicitly mentioning logistical and communication issues, inadequate preparation, or a lack of unity among local allies. This suggests that, according to the textbook, the campaign was not characterized by the problems mentioned in the claim. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing several issues that hampered the British campaign. They highlight logistical and communication problems, such as the delayed arrival of reinforcements on the Tamar, which led to halted operations due to the impassable Prah River during the rainy season. The articles also mention inadequate preparation, with troops lacking proper accommodations and a military road to the River Prah, and a lack of unity among local allies, as many native levies were unreliable and refused to fight. Furthermore, the articles describe the mismanagement and failure to capture Coomassie, with the campaign ending without achieving its objectives and British forces suffering from the climate and poor planning. These contrasting perspectives illustrate differing interpretations of the British campaign's challenges and outcomes.","The General History of Africa textbook provides a detailed account of the British military campaign against the Asante, particularly focusing on the events leading up to and following the 1874 defeat of the Asante by the British. The text does not explicitly mention logistical and communication issues, inadequate preparation and support, or a lack of unity among local allies as factors that hampered the British campaign. Instead, it highlights the British military's technical superiority, the strategic organization of their campaigns, and the use of African auxiliaries. The British were able to sack Kumasi in 1874, indicating a level of success rather than failure. The text also notes that the Asante were eventually subdued without a fight in 1896, as Prempeh chose diplomacy over military confrontation. Therefore, the textbook does not support the claim of mismanagement and failure to capture Coomassie due to logistical and communication issues or lack of unity among local allies. This absence of information related to the claim is a notable difference, suggesting that the British campaign was not characterized by the issues mentioned in the claim, at least according to the textbook.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the British military campaign in the Ashantee War.

There is mention of inadequate preparation and support, with troops arriving without adequate accommodations, some under canvas during the rainy season, and the lack of a proper military road to the River Prah. The articles also discuss the lack of unity among local allies, noting that many native levies were unreliable, with some refusing to fight, considering it a ""white man's palaver."" Additionally, the articles describe the mismanagement and failure to capture Coomassie, with the campaign ending without achieving its objectives and the British forces suffering from the effects of the climate and poor planning.

And yet the West Africans lacked neither courage nor military science. But they were at a heavy disadvantage in the face of the invaders. Apart from the technical superiority of their enemies' weapons, they had no real compensatory advantage over the conquerors. To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems. Finally, like Africans elsewhere, those of West Africa, except Samori, had to use outmoded weapons such as dane guns and bows and arrows in the face of cannon and the Maxim gun.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

Prempeh's firm but polite rejection of this offer is quoted else› where.$^{42}$ Prempeh followed up this rejection with an invasion and defeat of the Nkoransa, the Mo and the Abease in 1892. In reaction, the British offered to station a British Resident at Kumasi in return for the payment of annual stipends to the Asantehene and his other leading kings. Not only did the Asantehene reject this offer but dispatched a high-powered mission to the Queen of England 'to lay before your Majesty divers matters affecting the good estate of our kingdom'.$^{43}$ This diplomatic mission left Kumasi in November 1894 attended by over three hundred retainers. It entered Cape Coast on 10 December and left for England on 3 April 1895. Not only did the British government refuse to see the Asante mission but, while it was still there, instructed the governor on the coast to issue an ultimatum to the Asantehene to receive a British Resident and pay the war indemnity of 50000 oz of gold imposed on Asante in 1874. Of course, the Asantehene refused to comply with these requests, all the more so since he was awaiting the outcome of the mission to London.\nUsing this as an excuse, the British launched a full-scale expedition against Asante under the command of Sir Francis Scott. This expedition entered Kumasi in January 1896 without firing a shot since Prempeh and his advisors had decided not to fight the British but to accept British protection.

Smith deposed him and tried to impose in his place a white chief and Sandile's mother, both of whom were rejected by the Xhosa. Smith then outlawed Sandile and tried to apprehend him by force. By December 1850 the Xhosa had had enough of the British Governor's interference in their lives and began to attack British forces and military installations in the area. They wiped out a number of military villages.\nSandile's cause received wide support from neighbouring Africans. East of the Kei river he got the moral support of his brethren under Sarili's paramountcy. Many members of the African police and Cape Coloured Mounted Riflemen deserted and joined Sandile's forces. The Khoikhoi and some of the Thembu also fought on Sandile's side. The result was that many white farmers and Africans who sided with the British were killed, their livestock captured and immovable property destroyed. Meanwhile Smith relied on local African allies because the Cape Colony white farmers were not willing to fight his war. Even with more reinforcements he received from the British government in March 1852, Smith failed to crush the Xhosa rising. The war was only brought to an end by his successor, Sir George Cathcart, who enlisted the support of the Cape white farmers by promising to give them a part of the cattle looted during the campaign.\nIndeed when the Xhosa were defeated in October 1852, both the Xhosa of Sandile and those of Sarili - who lived east of the Kei and had mostly accorded moral support to their fighting western brethren - lost vast herds of cattle to the British. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > The Yaa Asantewaa War', 'content': 'Like the Hut Tax rebellion of 1898, the Asante uprising of 1900 was precipitated by the attempts of the British to consolidate their rule by the deposition of some of the anti-British chiefs and the appointment to replace them of people who were not traditionally qualified, and by the imposition of a tax, in this case 4s per head, as a war indemnity in 1897. But the last straw that really precipitated action was the demand of the British governor, Arnold Hodgson, for the Golden Stool to be sent to him so that he could sit on it. The Golden Stool was the most sacred object of the Asante, which they considered as the embodiment of their soul and a symbol of their survival as a nation. That demand, therefore, could not but touch off an instantaneous rebellion of nearly all the principal states under the leadership of the Queen of Edweso, Nana Yaa Asantewaa (see Plate 6.2). 64 The Asante forces attacked the Governor and his party who had to seek refuge in the fort at Kumasi which the Asante then besieged.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest.

In 1848 he took away vast Xhosa territories by annexing to the Cape Colony the area between the Fish and Keiskamma rivers and then declaring a separate British Colony of Kaffraria between the Keiskamma and Kei rivers. Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers. In Kaffraria itself, the Xhosa were split, up and allotted 'reserves', while their chiefs' powers were severely circumscribed by the supervision of imposed white magistrates. Such customs as labola (bridewealth) and accusations of witch› craft were outlawed as being contrary to British justice. Moreover, the white magistrates knew very little of the Cape Laws and nothing of the Xhosa legal system, with the result that they followed their personal instincts in reviewing Xhosa cases submitted to them. The members of the 500-strong African police force that backed the magistrates were untrained, and so proud to carry out the white man's orders that they became overbearing towards their people.

A moderate estimate of the loss of native life within the Protected Territories last year, immediate and contingent on the Ashantee ravages, places it at 10,000 human beings. From the greater completeness of the Ashantee preparations, there can be little doubt that the loss of life this year, had they again made an unopposed invasion, would have been still greater. Is it worth nothing to have prevented this? The disappointment is great at Cape Coast that Coomassie has not yet fallen into our hands, and we have thought it our duty to give expression to that feeling.

He finished by making the following important announcement: It had been determined to announce by the mail which would go out next Monday that a transport would be immediately sent to remove a portion of the troops from the Coast, and so reduce the troops to a number which might be accommodated by the ordinary means on the Gold Coast, with a due regard to their restoration to health, and that the troops in the interior should be removed altogether. The stockades which had been erected on the Kraa would be given over to the native chiefs, for them to protect the river and their own country. The stores would be removed as far as practicable; [and it would not be a very great pecuniary sacrifice if such stores as could not be removed were presented to the friendly tribes who undertook the protection of the stockades. Every measure would be taken to secure the safety and well-being of the troops at the Gold Coast; and, with regard to the future, he entirely sympathised with the feeling that we ought not to make expeditions into the interior of a country like Africa. (Hear.) We should make no war for vengeance, and we had no desire of conquest; and as the rains had put an end to the warlike operations, it was not the desire of Her Majesty's Government that the preparations for the invasion of the King of Ashantee's territory should be renewed.

The transport difficulty seemed to be the only real one; but this was so serious, that the 23rd were still detained on board their ship instead of being sent on to the front. The *Daily News* correspondent partially accounts for the difficulty as follows: ""It may be as well to inquire a little more closely into the causes of these grave defections on the part of the natives, for on the question of sufficient transport hangs now the success or failure of the expedition. Men are deserting right and left; a few days ago, a hundred disappeared at once. It surely cannot be that their pay is insufficient, although this is said to be a reason, for they were never possessed of so much money as they are now. There is, unfortunately, an unpleasant aspect of the question, and that is when it is viewed from the standpoint of the black man. The carriers declare they are badly fed and cruelly treated. This will doubtless form the subject of much correspondence hereafter; meanwhile this is what Quashie avers, and, resenting it, deserts. During the greater portion of his past life his existence has been easy, not to say slothful. His wife has toiled for him, and supplied him with means to obtain food and rum; whilst he has to the full enjoyed the *dolce far niente*. Suddenly called upon to work or fight, his fears of the dreaded Ashantee prompt him to become a carrier. But he is brought into contact with a hard taskmaster. An English officer—vigorous, untiring, stern, his very antithesis in character—receives orders to see certain stores taken to a certain point within a given time, and for this purpose he is allowed a fixed number of bearers, each of whom receives his proportion of the whole, and carry it he must. If there is any disposition on his part, as most probably there is, to grumble at the weight of the load, the officer cannot afford the time to hear complaints, and very likely will touch him up with a big stick. If he complain of sickness, he is told he is shamming, which is not at all improbable, and is again touched up. If he wish to linger over his rations at a halting place, he is roused up as soon as the last second of the time allowed has expired, and it is again perhaps necessary to introduce the stick. And then neither can properly understand what the other says. The Englishman, because the native does not at once comprehend an order given, it may be hurriedly, considers him a stupid, thick-headed fellow. The officer may plead necessity if he use strong means to have his orders carried out, but looking at Quashie\'s former life, it is not very surprising that he should take the first opportunity that presents itself to escape from a service which he finds in the last degree irksome and intolerable. The question of procuring transport is daily becoming more important, as not an hour even can be wasted now. Bullocks have been pressed into the carrying service, but 500 mules would be invaluable now, even if they only lived to carry one load. The contingent of women have behaved admirably, and very often they have done the bulk of the carrying. They have been used to hard work, the men have not.""

Along this space the British Army and its guns will have to pass; but I am told by one who has been the whole way to Coomassie that the road this side of the Prah is ""all right,"" compared with its condition on the Ashanti side. Sir Samuel Rowe is responsible for all; for, by a treaty which it was his duty to see carried out, the Ashantees undertook to keep the road open in their country. Our men will be crippled with rheumatism and killed with fever, owing to the wet; for in the forest, as I know from experience, there is not that sharp division into wet and dry seasons that prevails on the coast; a forest is always wet. There used to be a few miles of telegraph along the coast, but, instead of extending it, the Governor has allowed it to fall into decay, so that the broken posts are all that remain. This will be missed when the war breaks out; but the colony will not complain, even of a war, if it results in the recall of Sir Samuel Rowe.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1883#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The Ashantees are now on their own side of the Prah; they have now seen that they cannot make head against even the hitherto small British and native force led and officered by British officers, and backed by regular troops.

The King of Ashanti has sent down reinforcements to Amankoo-aitsi, with large supplies of ammunition; and he has ordered him to offer the most determined opposition to our crossing the river, and to die with his whole army before he permits us to catch a sight of the walls of Coomassie. The Ashantees do not believe it possible for us to accomplish the feat of taking Coomassie, and have all resolved to fight and die to a man before we shall effect an entrance into their capital. Our General’s sole difficulty is the want of an efficient transport; but as regards the capture of Coomassie, that is a foregone conclusion. Not all the might of Ashanti can avail them aught against the preparations that are being made, the new weapons of destruction with which we are armed, and the superior discipline, organization, and skill that will be brought to bear against them. They may resolve to die, and I suppose that is the best and all that they can do; for as to their being able successfully to resist the force that will be brought against them, no man of sense can believe such to be possible; and probably it is all for the best that our redoubted enemy should feel confident that we are unable to cope with them in their native wilds, as it will be likely to lead them, in their over-confidence, to try conclusions with us in a pitched battle, the results of which cannot but be fatal to them.\n\nThe field telegraph is being laid down from Government-house to Mansu, and will be continued to our most advanced outpost. The native levies are not coming forward with the alacrity that I at first anticipated; some of them do not appear to care about following the Ashantees up into their country, and would prefer being left quietly at home, to cultivate their ruined plantations and farms; so that, I am afraid, Sir Garnet Wolseley will not be able to collect together more than fifteen thousand men on whom he can rely.\n\nIt will be much to be deplored if some arrangements have not been made by which the railway plant, found useless for practicable purposes during this war, because there is no time to apply it, may be utilized in promoting the development of the resources of the country and its commerce.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-12-16', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Termination of the Second Campaign against Ashantees', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There must necessarily now be a pause, and we are not therefore called upon for an immediate opinion as to what should be done to assure the capture of Coomassie, should it be determined that the war is to be carried on until that be accomplished.

The road to the River Prah should be made a good military road; those precautions on the River Volta and in the Eastern Districts generally—for which we have constantly pleaded from the time war was imminent—for preventing the passage of guns, powder, lead, and salt (as also from Elmina), &c., to Ashantee, should be taken and made effective. Then communications should be opened with Coomassie—the fixed resolution of the British Government, unless terms of agreement are come to, should be made known—and every proper effort be employed for re-establishing peaceful relations. It was British power that first checked the conquests of the Ashantees. The mere organization of the native forces by Englishmen led to that series of discomfitures which lost them the sovereignty of the *Territories* and led to its transfer to us under the name of the *Protectorate*. But for us, the Ashantees would have massacred or sold off to slave-ships the whole of the population. They would do this even now but for our presence and protection.

The colonel commanding the troops (Colonel Conran) has divided the regular army into three divisions—the first division, under the command of Captain Mackay, 4th West India Regiment, to be accompanied by Staff Assistant-Surgeon Horton; the second division, under command of Captain Gabb, 4th West India Regiment, to be accompanied by Staff Assistant-Surgeon Steward; and the third division, under the command of Captain Thorne, also of the 4th West India Regiment, to be accompanied by Staff Assistant-Surgeon Gardiner.\n\nTo these divisions will be attached hereafter the local Militia, Volunteers, and native allies, numbering in all about 20,000 men, rendering each division about 7,000 strong.

These operations, though otherwise unimportant, were supposed to have produced a considerable moral effect both on the Fantees and Ashantees. The latter learned that the bush was not an inviolable asylum for them, and that, roads or no roads, they must henceforth hold themselves liable to attack; while the Fantees were shown that their dreaded enemy might be followed with success to his fastnesses, and that he is not possessed of a charm that ensures victory. Those first operations have been judiciously followed up by expeditions to Abracampa and Dunquah, on the 27th of October. The former, under Sir Garnet Wolseley, found only an abandoned camp, where some 10,000 men are supposed to have been so lately as twenty-four or forty-eight hours previously. In the dense bush the heat was excessive; but, by judicious arrangements, there were very few casualties; and none of them of a serious nature to deplore. Colonel Festing's force, of which the Anamboos formed the advance, surprised an Ashantee camp when the enemy were occupied with some repast. The surprise was complete, and there was an Ashantee sauve qui peut into the surrounding bush. Their tom-toms, however, beat immediately to action, and for some time a heavy fire was poured from the bush among Colonel Festing's men. As the day advanced, the Colonel recognized the impossibility of remaining in such a position throughout the night, and a return to the coast was ordered, and effected without further molestation. The casualties were five officers and forty-five men wounded. Nothing could afford more conclusive evidence of the wretched ammunition possessed by the Ashantees. Trade powder and small slugs, fired from trade muskets, are clearly not first-rate agents of destruction, or the casualties would not have been of the slight nature above detailed. The Ashanti loss must, it is thought, have been very considerable, as not only were rifle-bullets unsparingly poured into the bush, but grape and canister shot from a seven-pounder gun also. We entertain very little doubt that the Ashantees are now making a retrograde movement. Perhaps by this day on which we write,* they have for the most part crossed the Prah. It had been already sufficiently demonstrated to them, when the last news left the Coast by the Ethiopia, on the 31st of October, that their period of undisturbed occupation was at an end; while the King must have learned, through some channel or other, that a serious advance on his capital was contemplated. The British authorities are now finding the great, costly, delaying, and dangerous inconvenience resulting from the neglect in making roads during a period of peace. We did our duty on the subject; we can only again express our poignant regret that Downing-street and the local British authorities neglected theirs. As abundant stores were arriving—as strong reinforcements are on their way out—and all the British soldiers supposed to be needed will have arrived out before the end of December—we are bound to suppose that 1874 will commence with a vigorous march forward in the direction of Kumasi—that horrible, blood-deluged capital town of Ashanti. Meanwhile, if the reports we have received of Captain Glover's movements and intentions be correct, he will have cut off all supplies of arms, ammunition, and stores by way of the transvolta towns of Awoonah. We do not see how the British Government can in any way now stay its hand until the British ensign floats in Kumasi; and we hope to hear of rapid, as well as complete success."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain and Ashanti in the Past', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The foregoing is a brief sketch of our connexion with the Ashantees until the beginning of the complications which resulted in the despatch of the expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. These date actually from 1870, when negotiations were pending for the transference of the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast to the British. The King of Ashanti, Koffe Kalkalli, wrote, objecting to the transfer of Elmina, for which, he alleged, tribute had been paid to his ancestors. The agent of the Dutch Government repudiated the claim as ""entirely without foundation,"" but the British representatives refused to proceed further until the Dutch put their title beyond dispute. This having been done, the Treaty was concluded, and the ratifications exchanged in Feb. 1872. In April 1872 the Dutch Commodore wrote to the King, informing him of what had taken place, and requesting him to hand over to the English certain missionaries he held captive in his country. Mr. Pope Hennessy, the Governor, also communicated with the King, telling him that out of the friendship he had for him and his people he had ordered all the trading communications with Ashanti to be opened, and offered to pay double the sum received annually from the Dutch. A long correspondence ensued with regard to the missionaries, for whom a ransom was demanded. While the negotiations were progressing the King was secretly preparing for war, and, on Jan. 22, 1873, a large Ashanti army crossed the Prah and invaded the British Protectorate. The whole of the available Houssa Police were hastily mobilised, and arrangements made for the issue of arms and ammunition to the Fanti Kings. But the tribes could not be brought into line. They were most discouraging material of which to form an army. The Governor urged upon them the necessity for co-operation, as there could be no doubt that all their efforts would be required to arrest the progress of the hordes of the enemy which were at their gates. Reinforcements of troops were drawn from Sierra Leone; but their numbers were but small. Meanwhile the people were in a most distressing state of panic. At last the allied tribes, finding the Ashanti legions upon them, were induced to show fight, and eventually succeeded in holding the foe in check, but nothing could persuade them to follow up their success by an attack. Gaining courage by this the Ashantees moved forward and struck a blow at the Fanti camp. The Fantees managed to hold their own, and the Ashantees achieved no advantage. The cowardice of the allied tribes is almost incomprehensible. In two battles they had not sustained a defeat; if anything the fortunes of the day were in their favour; yet in a few days, they were in full retreat to the Coast. The break-up of the Fanti Army caused the utmost consternation at Cape Coast. The Administrator ordered that a gunboat should be sent to Elmina, as that fort was the principal settlement in the territory they were anxious to repossess, and the loss of which they had never been able to forget. The Ashantees, however, contented themselves by concentrating at a central camp at Dunquah, where they remained until the middle of May. The efforts to reorganise the Fanti tribes proved unsuccessful, and the home Government decided upon despatching such an expedition as would once and for all establish the sovereignty of the British on the Coast. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent for, and he advised the despatch of an European force, but the Government were unwilling to launch British troops without previous inquiry into a country which was sometimes called ""the white man\'s grave."" On June 9, a body of Marines, under Colonel Festing, was landed. This officer at once assumed command of the Forces, and, collecting all the available material, he advanced upon Ashanti camp and succeeded in driving the army over the Prah, with which he contented himself pending the arrival of fresh troops. The passages of the river were held, and every move of the enemy noted. By this time Sir Garnet had been despatched from England to Cape Coast Castle, constituted Commander of the Forces and Administrator of the Gold Coast. On his arrival he was more than ever convinced that European troops would be the best with which to undertake the mission he was charged with, and the troops he had asked for were sent out. This force, which consisted of three battalions of Infantry with some Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery and Administrative Services, were landed at Cape Coast Castle on Jan. 1, 1874, and on Feb. 4 arrived at Coomassie, having fought several battles on the way, and literally cut a passage through the dense brush and jungle. In addition there were two Native regiments which did excellent service, as also the Marines, Houssas, and West Indians. The Native levies that were raised by Captain Glover, R.N., on the Eastern side of the Protectorate proved quite unreliable. The greatest difficulties of the campaign arose from the almost complete lack of information that existed of the nature or topography of the country and although twenty-one years have since elapsed, but little has been added to the knowledge gained during the progress to Coomassie and the return to the Coast.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIANSBORG, ACCRA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—There is not much of importance to communicate from this place at present. I am afraid all the efforts you made about a road or roads to the Ashantee frontier are to remain yet for some time fruitless. The members of the local Government have too many little personal interests to manage and arrange, to allow of the energies of the administration being concentrated upon any one really useful undertaking. When a C.B., and other rewards and honours, were in prospect, the road came into fashion—indeed had military operations continued, it must have been made—but from the time Prahsou was abandoned, the projected roads were abandoned also.

Nothing of good can be effected here while the present system endures.\n\nSome Ashantees have been down here, having managed to get safely through the intervening territories. They made their appearance before the Governor, and reported considerable suffering in Coomassie, on account of the stoppage of trade; and inquired, as though sent by the King, but not publicly commissioned, whether the path was to be opened.\n\nI do not myself believe a word of their communication. The King of Ashantee, and the chiefs of Ashantee, are not men to send down word, even indirectly, that there is difficulty and suffering in Coomassie, if any such really existed; and no Ashantees would have come down to Cape Coast except they were sent by the Ashantee monarch.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The causes of failure', 'content': ""Every case of resistance and armed insurrection went down to defeat, at least if one considers only the results at the scene of action.

To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element.

Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems. Finally, like Africans elsewhere, those of West Africa, except Samori, had to use outmoded weapons such as dane guns and bows and arrows in the face of cannon and the Maxim gun. In the combination of all these factors lay the source of the African defeat."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British withdrawal from the interior', 'content': ""With the Transvaal out of the way, the commissioners turned their attention to the Orange River Sovereignty.

With a large force of infantry and cavalry, he met Moshoeshoe at Platberg on 15 December 1852 and delivered an ultimatum that was impossible to fulfil. Moshoeshoe was ordered to produce within three days 1000 horses and 10 000 cattle, which would be used as com› pensation for the Boer property lost during the Warden war and also to finance Cathcart's own current expensive expedition. When Moshoeshoe failed to meet the deadline and pleaded for more time, Cathcart ignored the King's excuses and ordered an invasion of what is today Lesotho. But he met with such stiff resistance from the Lesotho infantry and cavalry that he was only too willing and relieved to withdraw when Moshoeshoe displayed a diplomatically submissive posture in a letter dated 20 December 1852. Moshoeshoe beseeched the High Commissioner to be content with the loot of over 5000 cattle which the Governor's troops had managed to capture. The King confessed himself sufficiently punished and indeed well impressed by the power of the British and therefore begged for peace. He would also in future try to prevent his people from causing disorder. On receipt of the letter the following day, the Governor with his mauled army (thirty-eight dead and fifteen wounded) quickly pulled out of the dangerous kingdom. 5\nCathcart's experience of the Sovereignty quagmire added to the British conviction that the region could only be retained at a high cost. Sir George Clerk was therefore sent out to go and complete the British withdrawal from north of the Orange river. Getting wind of the impending British departure, Moshoeshoe prepared for the certain long struggle ahead with the Boers by destroying their potential allies, the Tlokwa, Griqua, and Kora in the north-west of his kingdom.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 352, 'article_title': 'Termination of the Second Campaign against Ashantees', 'full_section_title': 'Termination of the Second Campaign against Ashantees', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1864#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_05_1864', 'content': 'Last month, when the mail left that place, the Tamar, with her reinforcements, without the promise of which, we believe, the advance of 500 men to the Prah would never have been made, had been for some time daily expected at Cape Coast.

It was supposed that in a few days, at least, 1,000 disciplined troops would be ready for the march to Coomassie, assisted by three native divisions of 10,000 men each. Two guns, six mortars, two rocket tubes, a pontoon train, were all ready at the Prah, and a rapid push forward was contemplated. We doubted this, and would not give rise to expectations not certain of being fulfilled. The event justifies our reserve. The Tamar—by what mismanagement we do not know, whether from long indecision in England, or dilatory action in the West Indies when the order of departure arrived, or that the ship, which is just possible, may be an inefficient, crawling tub of a vessel—the Tamar, with her precious freight of 700 warriors, expected at the end of February, did not arrive till the 9th of April. Before she came the rains were on—the Prah was swollen and violent—the Ashantee bush, never easy to thread, must have become impassible—the Governor had declared the campaign at an end—handed over the government to Mr. Hackett, as Lieutenant-Governor (see Proclamation), and steamed off on a cruise on board the Commodore\'s ship, the Rattlesnake—Col. Conran, himself ill at Cape Coast, had ordered down a portion of the now almost officerless troops, and all was at an end for the season; save and except, alas! that some two hundred of the poor West Indians were appointed to remain in the encampment at the Prah, to guard the stores, artillery, &c., until the time shall arrive for a third campaign.

Churchill wished to express his heartfelt sympathy with the hon. baronet in the death of his brother, and also with the families of the officers who had fallen in this strife. It appeared that the differences arose from the King of Ashantee demanding the giving up, under an extradition treaty, of an alleged offender, which Governor Pine refused to do unless evidence of his guilt were supplied, upon which the King of Ashantee threatened the invasion of our territory, and in the spring of last year he invaded the Protected Territories, and the Fantees were obliged to turn out in great force to meet the invasion. Major Cochrane was sent with an auxiliary force, but he failed in his support, and in consequence the Ashantees overran the whole territory, massacred 4,000 or 5,000 Fantees, and then retired, and it was to prevent the recurrence of such an event that Governor Pine applied to the Duke of Newcastle. In reply, his grace stated that he had considered the plans submitted to him, but he declined to give his adherence to them, and he enjoined upon the Governor that the principle of all military proceedings on that coast should be that of defence, and not that of aggression, and that on that principle alone were governors entitled to make war; but ultimately Governor Pine was authorized to strike a blow against the Ashantees, if it could be done consistently with the safety of the troops. The Duke of Newcastle had shown the utmost desire that the troops should be cared for in every way—(hear, hear)—and to inveigh against the Government for culpable negligence was to make a charge which could not be sustained. Stores of various kinds calculated to serve for a long time were gathered together, and the disasters which had occurred might be attributed to the two facts that the Tamar, which conveyed the troops, had arrived a month later than was anticipated, and that the wet season set in a month earlier than usual. The delay of the vessel was not remarkable when it was remembered that the troops sent from the West Indies had to be collected from different islands, and that the ship had to make her way in the face of the trade winds. He did not think, therefore, that there was anything very unusual in arriving a month after the time expected. As to the troops being located near Cape Coast Castle, it seemed that was one of the healthiest stations on the Coast. The principal charge seemed to be that thirteen officers had died. But when this was stated, the nature of the climate must be considered, as well as the fact that all persons who went there, including the black troops, had to pass through a period of acclimatisation. This return of the deaths of officers, it must be borne in mind, extended over the whole year. He would also remind the House that officers in the line, who were anxious for rapid promotion, often exchanged into West India Regiments, and he had made the attempt himself; but if they did so they acted with the knowledge that they were exposing themselves to a climate most deleterious to health. He rather regretted the precipitate manner in which the Colonial-office had written to remove the depot at the Castle, and this not for any ulterior design of invading the territory of Ashantee, but for the purpose of ensuring the safety of those under our protection. He wished more efforts had been made to construct roads, which would not only have been valuable in a military point of view, but which would also be useful in the furtherance of commerce, and this might have been done at a trifling cost, probably at 35l. per mile. The Ashantees received a large portion of their supplies by the river Volta, one part of which formed a part of our territories, and the other part belonged to the Ashantees. That could be readily blockaded and supplies be thus cut off. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, and other munitions of war were obtained by the Ashantees through the Dutch settlements also. It was quite possible by certain arrangements to put an end to this kind of traffic. With regard to our army surgeons, two of the most competent, who were sent out with our troops, were coloured surgeons, natives of Africa, and who had been educated in the British medical schools. It appeared that they were the only two surgeons who had never been attacked with fever, or the other diseases incidental to the country. He thought that this was an important fact, which proved that if we were to maintain troops in that part of the world it was most essential to employ coloured surgeons to remain with them.

He could not help expressing regret, in which he believed every one in that room would join, that when he had a short time since a number of West India regiments who were the most fitted of any troops in the world to deal with wars of this class in climates of this nature, from a very ill-advised parsimony, they should have been cut down in numbers, and that when we could not get them for love or money we should be obliged to fill up their places with valuable English lives which could ill bear the strain of that most pestilential climate.

And when and how did these officers (and men) contract their fatal diseases? If their disease had been owing to immediate Government neglect, they would have been victims soon after their arrival. But no; the health of the forces was good from August, 1863, until some three weeks after they had marched in several directions into the bush of the interior. The mortality and sickness has occurred only since the end of February, with few exceptions. The local error committed we deem to have been this: The rains commenced two months before their time. We think that on the very first day of rain, all idea of further duty in the field should have been abandoned, and nearly all the troops have been ordered back to Cape Coast Castle without delay. When once the rains began, no troops could go into Ashantee, and no Ashantees would come into the Territories. Again, the campaign being over, we think the Tamar's men, who would otherwise have been marched up to camp immediately, where there were rations, &c., for fifty or sixty days, ought not to have been landed, there being no adequate accommodation for them. But the great sickness and death was not among these men, but among those who had been at Prahsoo and other up-country stations.\n\nWe hope that now the party battle has been fought, men will reason calmly about events which, though deplorable, have not the gravity that has been attributed to them. We never hear it said, when some regiment in India has been sent on necessary service, and the cholera has decimated it, that Government or the authorities deserve impeachment for sending men on such an expedition. And why should the case be different in Africa? We know, by news from the camp itself, that all necessary medicines and medical comforts were there. But the exhalations of a lately uncovered soil were poisonous; as also the water, which no attempt seems to have been made to purify, though sand was abundant, and charcoal enough might have been burned in a few days to form a filter bed for an army, instead of for a mere battalion.

There is one matter, however, connected with this subject which I am sure you will excuse my alluding to, as you are not likely ever to have lost sight of it—viz., that at Cape Coast we have no beasts of burden whatever; and the natives who carry stores and merchandise along the roads travel Indian-file fashion, one after another, in tracks forming single pathways. The roads in consequence become during the heavy rainy season to a great extent covered over with bush. Nothing has a greater tendency to brutalise or deteriorate the people here than a large portion of them being employed at work which ought to be performed by beasts of burden. Now mules, camels, and donkeys, it is said, would not only live here, but their introduction would be a matter of the very greatest benefit to the country, and a very great saving to the military authorities. Hitherto, horses have not succeeded, but donkeys, mules, and camels, it is said, would thrive. A Mr. Hutton, who was formerly a merchant here, sent to Teneriffe for two camels. They sent him by mistake two donkeys (the only donkeys of the genuine species which, it is said, ever made their appearance here). As the story goes, Mr. Hutton was so much annoyed at receiving donkeys instead of camels, that he let them stray into the bush, and it is to be deplored they were never afterwards heard of.\n\nWe have had already more rain this season than has been remembered for years. Of course, the miasma all along the Coast are increased by the wet weather. The health of Cape Coast has been, indeed, wretched. No one has escaped an attack of some sort or other.

And who does not see in the above short extracts similar causes to those which made Cape Coast so unhealthy a station, before Colonel Conran took the fever bull by the horns and restrained him by sanitary improvements; which, if adhered to and perfected as they ought to be, will reflect lasting honour on his Cape Coast rule, however seriously he may have erred in other important matters? Who does not recall to mind what made Lagos so fatally pestilential—who does not observe causes similar to those which led to the mortality in the Bristol, and to the late fever outbreak at Bathurst, Gambia? This question of the asserted deadly character of the climate of the West Coast of Africa over and above that of all other tropical or semi-tropical countries, is all-important in our eyes. As in the case of Bermuda, we cannot allow culpable official indifference and neglect at head-quarters—red-tape stupidity with obstinate ignorance in naval and military commanders—and carelessness and inefficiency in governors to decide this question for us! We believe that the West Coast countries contain what, considering their proximity to England, will necessarily make them to rank eventually among the most important possessions of the British Crown; and we cannot silently view our hold on any portion of them relaxed, because of a fever myth sedulously propagated by guilty and interested parties.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

What can be expected in a tropical climate on board such ships as below described by one of the daily press correspondents on the Gold Coast: ""If one has only a certain distance to go, and one wishes to be as long a time as possible over it, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to select a vessel better fitted for the purpose than Her Majesty\'s ship Bittern.

This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF BATHURST, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We regret that there have been false representations of the climate of Western Africa, especially the settlement on the Gambia. It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa.

A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts.

The evidence went to show that the valves were sticking, and did not work freely, and also that the steam gauges were not quite correct. The jury returned a verdict of ""Accidental Death,"" and expressed an opinion that the sticking of the valve was the primary cause of the accident, and also that the result might not have been so disastrous if the steam-chest lid had been properly secured, the evidence showing that this latter had been removed for the purpose of examining the valves, and had not been thoroughly bolted again.'}, {'id': 2588, 'article_title': 'ASHANTI WAR PREPARATIONS', 'full_section_title': 'ASHANTI WAR PREPARATIONS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_10_1873#article-3', 'issue_date': '30_10_1873', 'content': 'October 10.—Victualling stores from Deptford-yard, and stores of various kinds, collected from various quarters, are being sent to the docks about London and Liverpool for transport to the Gold Coast by trading vessels bound in that direction, and the bulk of the material for the Ashanti expedition may be regarded as having reached its destination, or as being on its way thither.

It is impossible for a mighty empire like that of Great Britain to undertake such an expedition as that against barbarous Ashanti, on behalf of almost equally uncivilized Fanti, without necessities arising for changes, the effects of which will endure long after the brief struggle shall have terminated, and which may exercise an enormous influence on the future relations of the protector and protected. We see many of these changes coming into view on the near horizon. It is not necessary, however, that we should at present call attention to more than one of them. Ashanti must be conquered and humbled, or destroyed (the power we mean, not the country or the people). In the effort to effect this the first steps have been taken in a change that may be of vast importance. The power of Great Britain has, in many points, a resemblance to that of ancient Rome. Like that, it has to do with hosts of semi-civilized or barbarous people in regions distant from its centre, and in great varieties of climates; and it must be looked upon as a great waste of central resources and strength to be prodigal of the lives of its strictly imperial citizens, or subjects, in far distant countries, where the climate is unsuited to their physical constitutions. The Roman Governments understood this thoroughly. With forces drawn from countries already conquered, and an admixture of Romans, they conquered other countries. We do not say that under analogous circumstances Rome would not have sent to the Gold Coast troops corresponding in their army with those—the 42nd, 23rd, and Rifles—which we have dispatched thither; but one thing we do say, that she would forthwith have set about organizing tributary forces of less value to occupy and hold what these 42nd, 23rd, and Rifles should have subdued. The lamentable loss of life in West Africa has long since drawn our attention to this matter. On the outbreak of the war, we inclined to urge upon the Government the advisability of looking for volunteers in the East Indies, among the Sepoys or Sikhs; but we imagined that Her Majesty's Government must know its own business best in such a matter. The Roman system has been adopted to a considerable extent in the East Indies; and this war has led to a commencement of it in West Africa. The West India regiments, hitherto generally employed, have suffered from the climate pretty nearly as much as the European troops would do; and have been not much less costly. The exigencies of the present expedition have led to the subvention, the drilling, and partial disciplining of Houssas, Yorubas, and others. We would have this beginning of change persevered with, and a system for West Africa, founded upon the principle of employing Africans for Africa, raised to the rank of a policy. Until such changes shall take place among the Fantee and other Gold Coast tribes, as should enable a dependable force to be organized among them, let the necessary force employed be composed of Africans from other countries, such as are now serving with Sir Garnet Wolseley and Captain Glover. It may also become a matter of Imperial policy to hold Kumasi. If so, let it be held by troops of this character, under British officers. They would increase day by day in efficiency; and every drilled and disciplined man of them, master of his Snider, and supported by Artillery and Rocket Brigade (and such corps could, no doubt, within a short time be formed with the same human materials),—every disciplined man among them, we say, will be more than equal to fifty of the hitherto renowned warriors of Ashanti, practised only in the use of smooth-bore trade guns and muskets, and supplied with ammunition rarely fatal in its effects at fifty yards' distance. The adoption of some such imitation of the Roman system in West Africa is of immense importance as regards its future. The British Government and people, although so deeply interested in, and so ardently anxious for, its civilization, have been almost afraid to touch it, because the doing so seemed as a necessity to demand the constant employment of British troops. No such deterrent would any longer interfere with the so much to be desired action of civilization upon barbarism, when once the formation of West African corps for West African service shall have been definitively adopted and pursued."", 'last_edit_date': '1874-01-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_01_1874#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We reproduce elsewhere two important papers relating to West Africa. One is a survey of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, furnished by an evidently well-informed correspondent of the London *Times*, on the occasion of Major McDonald and his staff sailing to inaugurate the new administration over 350 miles of seaboard and a large but undefined region inland. The other document is the Report of the Annual Meeting of the Royal Niger Company, describing the progress of settlement in their Niger territories. It is estimated that no less than half-a-million square miles are covered by their treaties or reserved to their influence by international arrangements. Both of these documents are interesting reading, as they speak hopefully and with justifiable confidence of development and progress. It may not be amiss to point out that, owing to the relative positions of these two British possessions, and the long frontier line which they have in common, the future of both largely depends on their administrators working together harmoniously for the common good. There is every reason to believe that this harmony will be maintained. Major McDonald has given many solid proofs of his capacity and tact; while the Niger Company have not only shown great administrative ability, but have successfully lived down the violent and, as it proves, unjustified attacks which were at one time made upon their policy and conduct. Major McDonald has a fine field open to him in the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which possesses a valuable and long-established trade, and can, therefore, with moderate taxation, yield a sufficient revenue for administration and development. We venture to hope that he will follow the example of the Niger Company in one particular—by largely using coloured agents in dealing with the native tribes. It is well known that some of the most useful work of the Company has been done by their numerous coloured officials.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British possessions of the Gold Coast extend over a coast line of about 350 miles, and are separated from the colony of Lagos by a short interval, which is filled up by a wedge of German, two wedges of French territory, and the narrow strip of independent Dahomie coast, which was until recently under the protection of the Portuguese. The inland limits of the Gold Coast colony are vague, and variable in extent. Behind our actual possessions, our political influence largely extends, and might be exercised much to the benefit of the interior were we less timorous about asserting it. In spite of several alterations in our Ashanti policy, we may consider the Ashanti kingdom as within the sphere of political influence. It would not be difficult to extend British influence from the Gold Coast right up to the great bend of the Niger, and thus secure them to British commercial influence. When we think of how much has been effected in the consolidation and extension of our Gold Coast territories since 1871, we may confidently hope for a further extension and a great future for this rich and important possession. The littoral of the Gold Coast is of the same moist equatorial character in its climate and scenery. The typical West African forest country ends, however, on the northern frontiers of Ashanti, and the characteristic park-like grass land scenery of Central Africa begins in the plains through which the Upper Volta flows. Beyond the Volta and the countries of Gyaman, Ashanti, and Brono, the inhabitants are mainly Mahommedans, and belong to a stock related to the Mandingos, although there is a large infusion of immigrant Hausa traders and fighting men. In some of these lands a proportion of the Hausa constabulary of the Gold Coast is recruited. Although the inhabitants of the Gold Coast belong almost entirely to what may be called the Ashanti family, yet increasingly the Hausa language is becoming the commercial tongue of the natives, although English has a great hold and is extending. The influence of the Hausa, no doubt, is aided by the presence of the constabulary, who are either recruited on the Niger or at the back of the Gold Coast.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH WEST AFRICA AND THE TRADE OF THE INTERIOR.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sierra Leone is not a colony about which we can boast very much. It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them. The productions of Sierra Leone are those of true Western Africa, and the colony is rich and well-favoured in vegetable wealth. It exports palm oil, palm kernels, rubber, gum, camwood, besides skins and benniseed and ground nuts.\n\nLiberia is British in language, and to a great extent in such culture as it possesses, although it enjoys an independent Government. But its native inhabitants, the Kru-boys, are under the delusion that they are British subjects ""of a sort,"" and do not admit any political connexion with the Americanised negroes who claim to govern them. On the east of Liberia, between the frontier and the west boundary of the French Gold Coast, is the Ivory Coast, about 100 miles in extent, and one of the last portions of the African coast, which remains unclaimed, unprotected, and unannexed by any European Power. Such trade as is done with it is purely British, and is chiefly with the town of Bristol.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""So much for the western frontier. On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The best resume of his policy is found in a set of instructions he issued to his officers in 1906, in which he argues for 'a single Government in which the Native Chiefs have well-defined duties and an acknowledged status equally with the British officials'.$^{10}$ The basis of what was to become the system of indirect rule was therefore one of co-operation, not sub› ordination, with the British Resident acting primarily in an advisory, not an executive capacity, and with the African 'chief - in this instance, the Fulani emir - continuing in a traditional role which was now carefully guided, not rigidly fixed by the imposed colonial administration. In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""This broad sketch of indirect rule in Northern Nigeria can be aligned with another which, like Lugard's, met most success in regions overlaid with Muslim political institutions.

What they labelled a politique d'association received considerable recognition at the turn of the century and was enthusiastically contrasted with the older ideal of political assimilation. The conservative colonial theorist, Jules Harmand, offered one of the best explanations of this policy in a long section of his influential work, Domination et colonisa› tion, published in 1910.

It is simply impossible that any Government can be properly administered under such a state of things, men being worked to death, and then half-starved.\n\nBut to compensate for the small pay (*pour encourager les autres*), they are allowed to assume military rank—only local, by-the-bye—so that a lieutenant to-day may be seen with the toggery of a captain to-morrow, and a major the week after next; and he is no more a soldier than my grandmother, and could not take a file of three soldiers round a corner. The Governor assumes the rank and wears the uniform of a lieutenant-colonel; the book-keeper is usually a major; the commandants of the different forts are styled captains, &c. This distribution of military rank—to judge and prosecutor, civil commandants, book-keeper, clerks, *et genus omni*—is the most unintelligible part of the Dutch Governmental programme, which otherwise is not altogether so shockingly bad. The Colonial Engineer generally comes in for the appointment of chief boatman, to look after the Government canoes and the old wheelbarrow; he wears a first lieutenant's uniform. The Assistant Engineer, or *onder baas* as they call him, wears no uniform; *mais en revanche*, has generally the sinecure office of senior gravedigger thrust upon him.\n\nEnough for the present; you shall soon have some additional details.—Yours faithfully,""}, {'id': 623, 'article_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'full_section_title': 'SIERRA LEONE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_06_1865', 'content': ""Colonel W.

We have especially objected to their doing so, because, among other things, we believe, with Lord Carnarvon, Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, that they are for the most part ""ignorant of the first principles of law."" We consider, then, such employment, wherever there is an educated community, however small, as an outrage to the moral feeling of the people, who would never think of looking to military officers, doing duty at the same time with their regiments in the same locality, for that pure administration of law and justice which is at the root of the public liberties and of social advancement. From the period when judges were made independent of the Crown in this country, and were required to possess great legal learning and unspotted private reputation, from that period the liberties of the land rapidly advanced. The order is as old as the great Roman satirist and poet, that with the avocation of the law, arms should be set aside. But not only has this been ignored at Cape Coast, but the very same thing has been done in what may be now called the Metropolitan West African Colony—Sierra Leone—where the ermine of the Chief Justice has been worn over the red coat of the soldier. We do not at all hesitate to believe our correspondents that in the case of Captain Bravo the feelings of the right-minded citizens were greatly outraged when they saw him placed on the bench as Chief Police Magistrate, invested with power to deal with cases up to the amount of 50l.; and much more so, when he was afterwards promoted to the post of ""Commissioner for executing the duties of Chief Justice,"" in which capacity he has actually tried serious cases of felony, and presided at a trial for murder. We entertain no hostility to Captain Bravo at Sierra Leone, any more than we did toward Captain Hall, or any other captain, lieutenant, or ensign of West India regiments, who may have sat as Stipendiary Magistrate or Chief Justice at Cape Coast. In a word, we have not, nor have we ever had, any personal hostility to any individual in office on the Coast; nor should we ever allow any private feelings to influence us in the discharge of our most responsible duty. But the good of Africa is what we have in view; and we therefore denounce in the strongest manner this very unhealthy state of things—this unmistakable tendency to military usurpation of important civil offices on the West Coast of Africa. Nor do we think that either Colonel Conran at Cape Coast, or Governor Blackall at Sierra Leone, could have so far encroached upon the demesne of the law by the promotion of their military friends to judicial offices, if the late Chief Justice of the Gold Coast, and Mr. Carr, the actual Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, had watched with adequate severity over the dignity of their important office. Law should ever inspire respect; but it is impossible that an intelligent native people can respect, nor can we call upon them to respect, the administration of justice, when they see their appointed judge oscillating between the barrack and the bench; now sitting as Chief Justice, and anon the gay and thoughtless soldier in quarters or on parade. Lord Carnarvon has pointedly deplored the necessary existence of such anomalies in a time of martial law, and of suspension of the organised tribunals, as lately in Jamaica; but they never can and never ought to be permitted to exist with a sound or healthy condition of the body politic. Governor Blackall, as Governor-General of the West Coast Colonies and Settlements, ought especially to set an example to Her Majesty\'s Administrators at other points on the Coast; and we cannot but deplore and condemn his promotion of military men, for however short a period, to high judicial offices. Such an employment of military men is the unerring evidence of despotic tendencies, as we can see from St. Petersburg to Paris, and does not belong to the system of a free Government. Military men in all ages have been the readiest instrument in the support of the civil power, and in their own proper sphere they can be made the preservers of public liberty; but placed outside their sphere and in civil offices, they are the hereditary and consistent enemies of popular rights. The attention of the Colonial-office must be directed to this great abuse in the administration of the law on the West Coast. Some remedy must at once be found. A single instance of this improper military employment might have been passed over as an exception, but the frequent recurrence of such things looks like a purpose and a system; and should this condemnable practice, this great evil, not be otherwise put an end to, the opinion of Parliament must be pronounced upon it.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1866#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gambia', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We are glad to learn that Colonel Anton, late Police Magistrate at Sierra Leone, has been appointed Administrator at the Gambia, vice Major Bravo.

The appointment of the Colonial Secretary to that post is a reversion to the policy followed up to 1872. As Colonial Secretary he is *au courant* with all affairs, while the officer in command of the troops might possibly be a perfect stranger to the Colony, and would only follow the Colonial Secretary's advice. It has even happened that a young lieutenant has been in command. A deal of mischief might result under such circumstances.\n\nThe officer commanding the troops in Sierra Leone has received instructions to despatch to the Gambia River at the first opportunity 3 officers and 50 men of the 2nd Battalion West India Regiment.

One is the unexpected disturbance on the coast at Benin. The other is the campaign, long prepared, of which the first decisive blow has just been struck by the Royal Niger Company in the interior. That the two crises should have occurred at the same moment is merely fortuitous, and the only connexion between them is such as might result from any embarrassment caused in the rear of the Niger Company's operations by a sympathetic Native revolt along the coast.\n\nThe Benin disturbance, with which the Imperial authorities are directly concerned and for which all necessary steps are about to be promptly taken, is only of the usual order of trouble which is apt to arise upon the Oil Rivers. The Native chiefs of each river-mouth have in turn given occasion for punitive expeditions of which the result is in all cases the same. The offending chief is deposed, military posts are established in his country, and the district is gradually opened to civilised intercourse. The chief of Okrika, on the Bonny river, was deposed for such reasons only a few months ago. There is scarcely an annual report of affairs in the Niger Coast Protectorate which does not include the account of an expedition against one or other of the river chiefs. For some of these the local forces of the Protectorate suffice. Benin is strong enough to require special measures of repression, and as Brass, situated close to the frontier through which the Niger Company's territory passes to the sea, might be disposed to seize the present opportunity for renewed misconduct, the position on the coast is likely to give some occupation to the Imperial squadron in West African waters.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers.

Operating from its coastal possessions on the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and in Nigeria, Britain halted effectively French expansion towards the lower Niger and into the Asante hinterland. The last Kumasi expedition (1900) was followed up in 1901 by the annexation of Asante, and Nana Prempeh was exiled to the Seychelles. The Northern Territories to the north of Asante were also formally annexed in 1901, having been occupied between 1896 and 1898. From the Lagos colony, Britain launched its conquest of Nigeria. By 1893 most of Yorubaland had been proclaimed a protectorate; the conquest of Itsekiriland was accomplished in 1894, and Nana Olomu, its resourceful 'merchant prince', was exiled to Accra; and while apparently unable to challenge King Jaja of Opobo in open battle, Harry Johnston, the British Consul, tricked him into attend› ing a meeting aboard a British warship, where he was made prisoner and shipped to the West Indies in 1887. Both Brass and Bini were duly con› quered by the end of the century. By 1900, British supremacy in southern Nigeria was more or less assured. The effective occupation of Igboland and some other areas of the eastern hinterland, however, were not accom› plished until the first two decades of this century. To the north, British conquest was accomplished from Nupe, where - by 1895 - George Goldie's Royal Niger Company exercised influence from Lokoja to the sea. Ilorin was occupied in 1897; and after the establishment of the West African Frontier Force in 1898 the Sokoto sultanate was conquered by Lugard in 1902.\nIn North Africa, Britain, already in a commanding position in Egypt, waited until 1896 when the reconquest of the Sudan was authorized. This was achieved in 1898 with savage and unnecessary bloodshed. Over 20000 Sudanese, including their leader, Khalifa 'Abdallah, died in battle.

But the international reaction to this occupation included a series of colonial annexations by Germany: South West Africa in April 1884 and Cameroon in July of the same year.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace.

This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

More than a million African soldiers were involved in these campaigns or campaigns in Europe.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 413, 'article_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'full_section_title': 'Parliamentary Intelligence', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-24', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': 'HOUSE OF COMMONS, JUNE 21.**  \n**NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.**\n\nLord Elcho asked the Secretary to the Treasury whether it was the intention of the Government to grant a subsidy of 5,000l. per annum, or any other sum, to the Company of African Traders (Limited); if so, upon what conditions the subsidy would be granted, and whether it would previously be submitted to Parliament for approval.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the noble lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, upon a similar application being made to him last year, declined to recommend that it be complied with.

It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention.

Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position.

There is a school in England, it says, which favours the idea of building up an East African dominion to maintain the Indian Empire. The means to that end are the sovereignty of the Turkish Sultan in Egypt, and of the Sultan of Zanzibar from Cape Gardafui to Mozambique.

With this iron road and the Nile, England will be virtually mistress of the whole eastern side of Africa, save the territory which belongs to Portugal. The ocean dividing India from Africa has become an English sea. *La Paix* questions whether Great Britain, which supports with difficulty the burden of her Indian Empire, will be able to bear the weight of a vast East African dominion.

As regards the projected blockade, the Prime Minister has stated very clearly the views and intentions of the English Government. This country has undertaken, in conjunction with Germany, to establish a blockade upon the East Coast, and this blockade is to be ""against the importation of the munitions of war and the exportation of slaves; and for nothing else."" Thus the policy and intentions of England are clearly defined. We wish the same could be said for Germany.

We have merely engaged in certain naval operations, and have not the slightest intention of engag...\n[Dec. 3, 1888.]\n\ning in military operations."" What we have undertaken will be conducted chiefly on the coast which falls under British influence. In no case will British ships be called upon to afford support to any military movement which may be attempted by the German forces on shore. It is necessary to lay stress on this, because it appears that in some parts of Germany, at least, a desire is shown for the employment of military forces on shore. Lord Salisbury makes light of the apprehensions lest the natives of the blockaded coasts may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags. So long as England and Germany are engaged in carrying out a policy which England has made her own for many years past there is no reason why this difficulty should arise. We rejoice that Germany recognizes a duty to civilization which England has long discharged single-handed, and co-operate with her in a course of action from which we could not have held aloof without abandoning our traditional policy and doing violence to national sentiment. But if Germany is resolved upon making her efforts for the suppression of the slave-trade subservient to an attempt to recover her position in East Africa, there is only too much reason to fear that the natives may fail to distinguish between the German and English flags when they see them associated together.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH EAST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is just three years since the British East Africa Company obtained its charter, and since then many things have happened affecting the situation in East Africa.

That is the sphere within which the Company is free to develop and establish its influence without interference from any other Power. In judging of the progress made it should be remembered that it is in a very different position from the sister company on the south of the Zambesi. The hindrances in the shape of climate, want of easy routes, hostile Arab slavers, and turbulent populations, add to the difficulties; as does the proximity of Germans with their irritating methods towards the natives. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made. The port of Mombasa has been improved; a European town is growing up on the old site; a railway towards the interior has been begun; agents are established at all the chief ports; regular communications with these have been established; routes have been laid down as far as Uganda, while half-way a fortified post and trade depot has been built. The friendship of the natives has been quietly secured. Experiments in planting timber and in testing the suitability of other cultures have been carried out. A fair estimate has been obtained of the value of the Sabaki river as a trade route and a source of water supply, as also of the areas of land suitable for pasture and agriculture, and these estimates have been encouraging. The value of the Tana river as a trade route has been proved; this river leads direct to some of the richest parts of the Company's territories. British influence over Uganda and Usogo has been secured. In short, the Company has done much to establish trade, to render the region between the coast and the lake secure, to ascertain its industrial capacities, to abolish slavery, and to promote civilisation. Had Lord Salisbury seen his way to carry the vote for a subsidy to promote the construction of a railway to the lake, progress would have gone on at a tenfold rate, and the slave trade would have been doomed.

Between the years 1881 and 1885 the Company almost ruined itself in defeating the efforts of France to gain possession of the basin of the Lower Niger. But although the struggle ran at moments so close, the result was entirely successful for British interests. The French houses withdrew from that portion of the river, and in consequence of what had been done Great Britain was enabled, at the Conference at Berlin in 1884, to take the position of the only Power having influence on the Lower Niger.

I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value.

It is about 102 years old, thus considerably younger than the Gambia, which almost ranks with Newfoundland as being one of the very first British possessions abroad. Sierra Leone, however, has not much to show for its century of British rule. Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary.

Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear.

By then domination had shifted from military to civil institutional control while direct force tended to be replaced by administrative persuasion. This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did. In fact, the only colonial power which elaborated a significant military policy for the Africans under its domination was France which, from the first years of the twentieth century, considered sub-Saharan Africa a man› power reservoir essential to the maintenance of the French military posture in the world.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""A product of colonialism and one which is often ignored by most historians, but which has turned out to be of crucial and fundamental importance, was, as is evident from R.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

European abolitionists found, for example, that to stop the slave trade and the wars in the interior, they had to reckon not just with the coastal rulers but also with the different power bases in the interior. Both British and French abolitionist missions from different parts of the Lower Guinea coast commonly had to visit Dahomey kings at Agbome in the first half of the century. To mediate in the Dahomey-Yoruba wars, visits had to be arranged to both Abeokuta and Agbome. Similarly, British peace› makers involved in resolving aspects of nineteenth-century Yoruba warfare had to travel virtually throughout the length and breadth of the culture area.\nUnfortunately, the European approach was divisive, tending towards politically structured differentiation. This was already noticeable in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The appointment in 1849 of John Beecroft as British Consul for the Bights of Benin and Bonny (formerly Biafra) signalled the dawn of a new era. British interests came to be specifically protected visà-vis the interest of other European nationals; British interests were also advanced against those of Africans.

Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'Military conquest, 1885-1902 > Why were European powers able to conquer Africa?', 'content': 'European powers were able to conquer Africa with such relative ease because in virtually every respect the dice was so heavily loaded in their favour.

The Portuguese made extensive claims both in Angola and in Mozambique. They had established military outposts and prazos (agricultural estates) in the interior, and from time to time they controlled the area from Loje, south of Cuanza, as far east as Kassanje, apart from trading posts on the coast between Ambriz and Moçâmedes. In Mozambique their effective control was by 1800 limited to Mozambique Island; elsewhere they depended more on Brazilian and mulatto merchants than on Portuguese officials. The increased demand for slaves in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century had shifted attention from the prazo system, and the security of the trade routes depended more on the pombeiros (barefoot mulatto merchants), bearing Brazilian trade-goods and surviving only on the good will of African rulers and merchants.$^{10}$ The French had revived their trading posts in Senegambia after 1815, notably Saint-Louis and GorØe. Their venture to establish an agricultural farm in Waalo with a military post in Bakel to protect it had been a failure. In North Africa, they seized Algiers in 1830. They spent the next twenty years overcoming the resistance of the Algerians, notably the movement led by Amir 'Abd al-Kädir. The British had established Freetown and the agricultural villages on the neighbouring peninsula as centres for the acculturation of freed slaves into a Creole culture. With the increasing prosperity and expansion of the Creoles to Bathurst (now Banjul), Badagry, Lagos and beyond, British commercial and missionary influence was spreading along the coast and at one or two points like Abeokuta began to penetrate into the interior around 1850. On the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the British still shared the trade with the Danes and the Dutch, and took measures to resist Asante (Ashanti) efforts to dominate the coast, notably by exploiting the Fante fear of Asante domination and encouraging the Fante to act together under British tutelage.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'A second serious social legacy has been the European and Asiatic settler problem.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself.

It is true that the great historical drama now being played out in Ethiopia includes an infinite variety of characters and a wide diversity of scenes; but one stage holds them all. The progress of the Khartoum Relief Expedition, the better government of Egypt, the high-handed action of the Boers in Zululand, the activity of German aggression on the West Coast, and the vast possibilities involved in the systematic colonisation of the Congo territory, represent only a few of the more urgent considerations now forcing themselves on the country\'s attention. Yet this enumeration, brief though it be, more than suffices to show the extent and importance of English interests in Africa. In view of the active ambition of other nations, these two points cannot be too frequently or too strongly insisted upon; for the physical peculiarities of the ""Dark Continent"" find their counterpart in its political features. Among the great divisions of the globe it occupies an absolutely unique position. Excepting the Valley of the Nile, Cape Colony and the immediately adjoining territories, together with little more than a fringe of coast settlements, Africa might, not long since, have been broadly and generally described as one vast ""No Man\'s Land."" Little by little—the huge dimensions of the continent rendering encroachment almost imperceptible—England, led by the pioneers of her trade and commerce, has succeeded in laying the foundations of an African Empire that promises one day to eclipse the might, no less than the wealth, of the richest possession of the British Crown. But while this prospect has excited the envy, it has also stirred the emulation of other nations, and England apparently is not to be allowed to shape and wield the destinies of the ""Dark Continent"" either undisturbed or unopposed. Consolation may, however, be found in the thought that the development of responsibilities will be accompanied by an increase of strength and determination adequate to the demands of the occasion, while a special measure of assurance may be drawn from the decisive, though dangerously-delayed, measures now at last urged forward by the Government for the relief of General Gordon. If an equally clear, energetic, and truly popular policy were at once adopted, not only as regards the Boers in Zululand and in the Transvaal, but also with respect to the colonisation of the Congo districts, and other scarcely less momentous questions, the country would be prepared to quietly abide the course of events, feeling assured that time and the effect produced by national characteristics fought on the side of British dominion in Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Twenty Years in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The last twenty years has been an eventful period in the history of West Africa. It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The writer proceeds to give some interesting information about a European established in these parts, one M.

He did not marry the daughter of Mirambo, as has been stated, but a negress whom he rescued from slavery. He was formerly employed at Zanzibar, but subsequently took to travelling in Africa and carrying on the ivory trade. The English often tried to purchase his services, but without success, for he does not like them. However, forced by necessity, he has accepted their offers, and is now conducting a caravan of merchandise for the English.\n\nAs regards one of the monarchs of Africa, the Abbé says: ""Mirambo enjoys in Europe a reputation far beyond his merits. He is a cruel tyrant, whose caprice is the only law known. His army reckons scarcely more than four hundred men. If he does not make the Europeans pay the right of passage, he knows how to make up for it in another and far more advantageous way. He proposes to every white man who crosses his country the pact of blood. At the end of the ceremony he makes a few gifts, but he besieges the European in return with demands which have to be satisfied.""\n\nThe writer concludes with some remarks respecting the doings of the English.

England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Italy are attempting to obtain titles to the country. England has made annexation of the coast lying adjacent to her colony of Sierra Leone; France is forcing her way on the Senegal and toward the head-waters of the Niger; she threatens to annex the coast from the Gaboon to the Congo, some 250 miles, and is running her lines on the Upper Congo. Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern. Captain Burton has asserted that he knows nothing to equal the prodigious wealth of the land, even in California, or in the Brazils. \'Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore.

This, with the frequent changes in policy natural to a Government which is always being changed, has ""prevented them from attaining the prosperity at which they might otherwise have arrived."" As for England, her policy is described as prevailing not only in the ten colonies which she owns in the continent, but almost everywhere throughout the central and equatorial parts of it. The Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and German possessions are then mentioned, and a claim is put in on behalf of Belgium, not, indeed to actual territorial possession, but to a number of commercial settlements owning some local property. It is, as the Belgians assert, their legitimate boast that, on the initiative of King Leopold II, they opened the Congo to the navigation of the world. It is, therefore, with this part of Africa that they have the most to do. They have established a joint-stock company, called the ""Belgian Company of African Commerce,"" which was incorporated in March, 1882, with a capital of 10,000l. Of this sum about 2,000l. was spent in the purchase of the vessel Akassa, which is, no doubt, destined to do wonders on the Congo river.

Its frontier along the coast now extends for about 180 miles, and reaches inland for an average distance of 100 miles, although we only exercise effective rule over a limited portion of this area. The harbour of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is the only good harbour on the West Coast between the ports of the Cape Verde Islands and the Island of Fernando Po, off the Niger Delta. As such, and as one of our fortified coaling stations, the importance of the retention and development of this colony cannot be lost sight of. The native races of Sierra Leone belong principally to the Timani and Bulom and Mandingo families. The town is beautifully situated at the corner of a peninsula and at the base of fantastic wooded mountains. Much else of the colony is flat and even swampy; and this little mountainous peninsula jutting out into the sea probably represents the highest ground within the limits of this possession. At the back of Sierra Leone we practically have the Upper Niger, the sources of which are not many days\' journey from the Sierra Leone boundary. Here at present the great Mahommedan Chief Samadu is the actual ruler, and has created one of those African empires which are easily reared by successful robbers with extravagant bloodshed and widespread depredation. Samadu has several times fought the French on the Senegambian frontier, but of late he is said to have concluded peace with them.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

It was also under direct pressure from the Trarza Moors, to whom it had been forced to cede the right bank of the river and whose frequent incursions it was unable to resist. This was the weakened, disturbed country in which the new relationships with Europe uneasily took shape. The clandestine slave trade was not important further north than Portuguese Guinea. When the French re-occupied Saint-Louis and GorØe (1817), a new basis for commercial relationships had to be found. Gum, hides, and beeswax were commodities which any peasant could produce. The French on the Senegal, however, like the British further south in Sierra Leone, wanted to set up European-run plantations as a substitute for the West Indian plantations. This was the aim of the great agricultural colonization scheme based mainly on cotton and sponsored by Governor Schmaltz and Baron Roger at the expense of Waalo from 1819 to 1827. The enterprise failed because of technical mistakes, shortage of manpower, opposition from traders and the hostility of the Africans. Thereafter, a purely commercial policy was adopted in which the Saint-Louis merchants had to adapt to the growing influence of the great export houses, above all those of Bordeaux.

To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite.

Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction.

Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': 'Thus, in the centre and the north of the region covered in this chapter, existing political structures went into in a state of increasingly rapid decline in the nineteenth century and in some cases came to be dominated by new forces which had arisen mainly as a result of the Sokoto djihäd.

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans.

Not an inch of the whole of East Africa had come under the control of any European power, while only the coastal stretches of Mozambique and Angola of the whole of Central Africa were being ruled by the Portuguese. It was only in Southern Africa that foreign rule had not only been firmly implanted but had even been extended a considerable distance inland (see Fig. 1.1).

The first phase lasted from 1880 to the early 1900s, and the second from the early 1900s to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Each of these phases saw different European activities which produced different initiatives and reactions on the part of the Africans.

Variables included the nature of the polity (whether or not centralized, whether or not dominated by another African power, and whether or not on the upswing or settled and declining), 1 the nature of the leadership provided, the extent of the penetration of European political, religious and economic influences by the 1870s and the experiences gained from this. Another equally important variable was the method adopted by the European imperialists in the establishment of their control over the area between 1880 and 1914.\nThe first phase saw either the use of diplomacy or military invasion, or both, by the Europeans.

The River Niger is distinguished from all other rivers in this respect, that whereas a great deal of curiosity always has existed about the sources of other rivers (more particularly the Nile, which has recently been solved, or is said to have been solved) with regard to the Niger it was as to the course which that river took after it left Timbuctoo. It was known to rise in the mountainous regions not far from the Atlantic, and to proceed in an easterly direction to Timbuctoo, and there this immense body of water was lost sight of, and was supposed for a long time to be swallowed up in the sands of the Great Desert. But by the enterprise and efforts of British travellers, and with fearful sacrifice of life, the question was at last solved by Mr. Richard Lander, who in the year 1830 followed its course in a boat down to the sea. Therefore, in 1832, a company was formed—a mercantile company—in Liverpool, to open up the commerce of the interior by means of the Niger. The expedition was attended with a total loss of the capital embarked in it, and with a fearful sacrifice of human life; in fact, I have in my eye now my friend Mr. Hector, who I believe is the sole survivor of that expedition.\n\nWell, during the years 1839 and 1841 the enterprise was taken up by Mr. Robert Jamieson, who sent out a steamer and navigated that river with very great success as far as proving its capabilities for steam navigation, but, unfortunately, with very great loss as regarded the capital embarked in it.\n\nFollowing upon that Her Majesty's Government sent out in the year 1841 an expedition, which is popularly known as the Niger Expedition. It was fitted out with great pomp and circumstance, under the auspices of Prince Albert and a great many philanthropic, and benevolent, and religious gentlemen, who took great interest in this expedition. But it produced no commercial result at all. The arrangements were conceived in such a faulty manner, and everything connected with it so badly organized, that it literally accomplished nothing. It neither added to our knowledge geographically, nor did it, in fact, attempt to do anything commercially.""}, {'id': 4298, 'article_title': ""Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition an Utter Failure"", 'full_section_title': ""Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition an Utter Failure"", 'last_edit_date': '09-07-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1881#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_10_1881', 'content': 'TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES._\n\nBathurst, River Gambia, September 7th, 1881.\n\nDear Sir,—That coming events cast their shadows before them, no reasonable mind can gainsay; just after this manner, we have been able to predict, almost to a certainty, that the expedition to Timbo, under the leadership of Dr. Gouldsbury, would leave in the annals of the history of West Africa much to be deplored.\n\nBut for the exertions of Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Thomas Brown, the expedition would have collapsed ere it left the Gambia. In truth, it might be said that to those two gentlemen the praise is due for the starting of the expedition at all. Before the expedition started, Dr. Gouldsbury had so much pared down everything to starvation point, that both the policemen and carriers, in their deep distress and mortification, were to be heard soliloquizing, as they were being shipped on board the St. Mary, the painful utterance of the children of Israel to Moses in the wilderness. Starvation, with the police and other labourers, began before they were landed at Yarbutender, the starting-point of the expedition.\n\nIt would appear that Dr. Gouldsbury, not satisfied with the arbitrary power wielded by him at the Gambia, carried his despotism into the interior of Africa.\n\nIn the _West African Reporter_, published at Sierra Leone, a copy of which I herewith enclose, it is reported that the King of Timbo had sent a message to Governor Havelock, complaining that Dr. Gouldsbury had carried away from one of his towns a slave-woman, much to the annoyance of both king and subjects, the result being that Dr. Gouldsbury\'s horse was seized by order of one of the chiefs.\n\n_The Reporter_ pertinently says that Dr. Gouldsbury could not have been actuated by humane feelings in the matter, because, as...\n\nhe had been so, he would not have left behind one of his carriers, who has been found in one of the interior towns in very bad condition. No sooner had the news of the man having been found reached Governor Havelock, than he at once despatched some one to go and fetch him down. We hope soon to hear of his safe arrival at Sierra Leone.\n\nThe King of Timbo grew so indignant at Dr. Gouldsbury\'s conduct that he has at last, and much against his wish, invited the French to his country.\n\nWe learn that already a French mission has gone to Timbo, and, we fear, within a month or two hence the place may become a French protectorate.\n\nWe have spent over 2,000l. on account of the expedition to Timbo, and the result has been a gain not to the West Coast, but to Dr. Gouldsbury only, who, by the way, receives in shape of travelling allowance, besides his full salary, upwards of 400l.\n\nWe have to thank the home authorities for sending us such men as Dr. Gouldsbury; he belongs, we have no doubt, to the class relative to which a well-known statesman remarked not many years ago: ""We cannot give you our best men, and you must content yourself with those we send you;"" or words to that effect.—I am, &c.,'}, {'id': 4353, 'article_title': ""A Snubbed Colony—Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition"", 'full_section_title': ""A Snubbed Colony—Dr. Gouldsbury's Expedition"", 'last_edit_date': '11-20-1881', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1882#article-2', 'issue_date': '02_01_1882', 'content': 'The writer has advocated the development of trade from the Gambia, as far as you can go by water, towards the Upper Niger, then to work the portage by caravans for a few years, to be followed by bullock-waggons. Then, if the trade paid, make a horse tramway; this, if profitable, to be followed by a railway. That latter may be fifty years in the womb of Time.\n\nDr. Gouldsbury says that the natives of Garboo, its towns, and the towns to the north, wish to carry on trade with Yarbutenda, and the roads to be kept safe. Who is to do it? Were the Government to put a block house at Yarbutenda, with a garrison of, say, twenty men, with orders to patrol the roads and put down marauders, then trade would be safe, the natives would flock in.\n\nThe report is bald and deficient in original information; that may be because it is an ""official report."" Dr. Gouldsbury can write, I know. I trust he will explain and enlarge his ""report"" by publishing a pamphlet or a book. Lieut. Dumbleton\'s charts, itinerary, and notes, are the pith of the report, but they are but pure geography, at the same time the charts, notes, &c., are really good. We have not any information as to products beyond what has long been known.\n\nGeology is only represented by the remark that ironstone exists under some hills; how about other strata, rocks, &c? Are there any granite rocks in the mountains from Cardy to Timbo? Any quartz measures? In the lower grounds have any coal measures been detected?\n\nBotany is undescribed, except by long grass, fan and oil palms. Zoology is represented by horned cattle, goats, and sheep. They have not had time to observe other animals, plants, or birds.\n\nThis expedition, conceived in haste, planned at full speed, and carried out to, if possible, get ahead of season and time, appears to be but a counter-move of a weak nature to the expeditions of the French from Senegal to the valley of the Upper Niger. It rushed through the country, regardless of utility, making treaties, giving presents to all ""by order,"" trying to get ahead of the rainy season, and what have we got for it?\n\nLieutenant Dumbleton\'s survey! The wonder is that with such undue haste he was able to make so good a one.\n\nThe expedition started at least two months too late under such orders that no one can blame Dr. Gouldsbury for the speed he tried to go at. He should have started early in November, 1880. That the report should be deficient in commercial information is not to be wondered at when we consider that from the leader to the carriers there was not a man cognizant with trade in Africa, especially with this portion of it—unless we take the ill-remunerated interpreter, Sulliman Waggy, who is a native trader, as an exception. However, the Report of the Expedition will please the M.P.\'s; they will praise it to their constituents the B.P.

Also the medical stores sent from England were deficient in necessary articles, and in quantity, the bulk being medicines more suitable for hospital practice at home than an expedition in the tropics. Also Dr. Gouldsbury sent back the boats he had with him without replacing them with canoes; thus he is deprived of the advantage of water carriage. We fear that the economy system, that has done so much harm to Gambia, will have ruined this expedition.

Now, the words ""your opinion"" mean it is his lordship\'s opinion, based on that of the Administrator, that trade is good. And how does he arrive at that? Well, he takes the return of the revenue for the past couple of years and compares that with former years, and it looks well; but then importers and exporters had to pay duties each year whether they lost or not, hoping for the best; but really the past two years have been most disastrous. Four small mercantile houses have been smashed and disappeared; all the other houses have lost heavily, and some are considering about reducing or giving up the trade. The revenue will not increase then. His lordship ""will not allow the use of force to stop native wars; counsel and persuasion must be used.""

The objects of the expedition are ""Geographical, to learn the value of Upper Gambia as a highway for trade. Political, to visit and give presents to the Kings of Timbo and Falaba, and chiefs along the route."" Now, if the value of the Gambia was sought for, why not take light canoes to ascend it, as was recommended here to Dr. Gouldsbury, and not heavy, clumsy boats? But then he had the boats for nothing, and refused canoes, because they had to be purchased. Thus he had to send his boats back from Bady at the outset of his journey, and go entirely by land. The fact that Timbo is Mohammedan, and Falaba pagan, and in a chronic state of war, should have proved to the Colonial Office the mistake it would be to send the one party to the two places; but everything seemed crowded into the one expedition and its cost. The allowance of stores—food—per day to each officer was miserable in amount, as it is most difficult often in the interior to supplement such supplies with food fit for Europeans, purchased from the natives. ""Duplicate receipts of all moneys paid, or presents given to natives must be obtained, countersigned by one officer and a native official."" The Government seem to throw doubt on the probity of their own officers: 300l. cash in threepenny pieces is sent, and is ""packed in three cases of thirty-six lbs. each."" Here comes a joke. The cases are sub-divided into tins of twenty-five lbs. each."" How can you sub-divide thirty-six lbs. into tins of twenty-five lbs. each? In a letter of February 15, Dr. Gouldsbury complains of the men suffering from sleeping in the heavy dew. Why not have supplied each man with a piece of heavy cotton cloth, six feet long by two and a half wide, and a curtain of light cotton cloth attached to the sides and ends, two and a half feet deep? This would have protected them, and not much increased the loads they carried. The writer has often used a similar protection when travelling in Africa. We next come to the report of the two native messengers sent by Governor Streeten from Sierra Leone to the King of Timbo to announce to him that Dr. Gouldsbury had started from Gambia for Timbo. This report, couched in its quaint language, is of much interest when we consider that the messengers were uneducated natives. We will now turn to Dr. Gouldsbury\'s ""Report of the Upper Gambia Expedition."" He mentions Sir S. Rowe\'s ""energy and zeal"" in the organization of the expedition in England. I fully respect his Excellency\'s energy and talents, and he deserves it; but in this case he used them to take the money from Gambia for the political glory of Sierra Leone, because Gambia has a surplus, and Sierra Leone is in debt. Of course, Dr. Gouldsbury had to report that the steamer St. Mary broke down on her way to McCarthy\'s Island. Breaking down is chronic with her whenever she goes up the river. Dr. Gouldsbury describes how he was humbugged on his arrival at Yarbutenda, by Nally Saynah pretending to him to be King of Cantora country, when he is only head man of the town of Farintoomba. Where were his Excellency\'s interpreters? They knew who the man was. In 1876 Nally tried the same game with the writer. I let him do it; I even gave him a small present as ""King of Cantora."" He took a letter the late Captain Cooper, then Administrator of the Gambia, had given me for the king; he promised to get me horses and donkeys and guides to go to Jellacotta next day; he visited me on the mornings of two consecutive days, but horses, donkeys, or guides did not come. I then sent a messenger to King Collie, at Songcoonda, the capital of Cantora, stating what Nally was doing. Collie came down next day. I had Nally brought before him, stated that he had obtained presents and a letter by saying he was King of Cantora. After that Nally had a warm few hours of it, and Collie fined him heavily. Nally threatened to catch me and flog me, so next day I went to his town. He was most civil, and continued so all the time I was in the country. Evidently he ""walked into"" the Governor this time. There is no town of ""Cantora,"" as the report says; the town is named Songcoonda.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-11-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_01_1882#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Failure of two African Exploration Expeditions', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, on Monday, the 4th December, Sir Roderick Murchison said that he regretted to have to announce the failure of two African expeditions, in the success of which the society had a deep and heartfelt interest, but which had both ended in disappointment. The first was the expedition of the Baron Van Derdecken, to explore the interior of Africa, from Zanzibar, where he intended to go up one of the rivers. He fitted out the expedition entirely at his own expense. He, it would be remembered, was the first to settle the point of the existence of a large snowy mountain in Africa, under the Equator. The Baron, he was sorry to say, had lost both his steamers, and when last heard of was nearly dead himself. He had been fighting with the natives; one European and all the natives went down in the small steamer, and the doctor who accompanied the expedition had been ill, but when last heard of was recovering. He was not able to go further into the details of the misfortune. The other failure was that of the expedition of M. Du Chaillu, who had devoted the whole of the little fortune realised by the sale of his book to fit out a little vessel suited for his purpose. When he arrived out he had to wait for instruments, but did not waste his time, since he sent gorillas and plenty of other curiosities to the British Museum. When he reached the interior the small-pox broke out among the natives, and as they considered that he and his party had brought the disease among them, dissensions followed. M. Du Chaillu had encountered great difficulties, but he (the speaker) was not yet well informed as to their nature. However, he had received a telegram from M. Du Chaillu on Saturday, from Falmouth, saying that he had been obliged to fight his way back to the coast, but that he had managed to save his astronomical instruments and observations.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.726, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'FRENCH AFRICAN EXPLORATION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Abbé Debaize, in charge of the French Expedition sent to Africa, has written to the Director of the Paris Observatory a most interesting letter, full of curious details, concerning the ""Dark Continent,"" and the various expeditions which are now exploring it.

He says: ""Yesterday the caravan of the French Expedition, with flags flying and music playing, entered Kouikouron, the capital of Unyanyembe. The most sympathetic reception was given to us by the thousands of negroes who gathered round us.

Of the five hundred men forming my caravan not one has deserted, and I have not lost a single thing. From Zanzibar to the present spot I have not ceased to enjoy perfect health.""\n\nThe other expeditions do not appear to be so well favoured. The Abbé Debaize alludes to two in particular—namely, the Belgian Expedition and that of the Missionary Fathers of Algeria. As regards the Belgians, he says: ""They have experienced troubles of all kinds. At Meromero a revolt broke out in their camp. Two hundred and eighty of their men abandoned them, carrying off with them a quantity of valuable goods. At Mpuapona one of their Zanzibar men was wounded by a native.\n[APRIL 1, 1879.]\n\n---\n\nTo avenge him, they killed five of the inhabitants. The whole of the country rose, and war was imminent. The English were obliged to interfere to put an end to the affair. On arriving at Crumbo, the remainder of the men of the Belgian caravan deserted; fresh servants had to be found, and at length the Expedition reached Mirambo, but almost ruined. The missionaries from Algeria, who are going to establish stations on Lake Tanganyika and in the Uganda country, have not been more fortunate than the Belgians. They had to pay a ruinous sum for the right to pass through the Ugogo. They were abandoned by their native servants, and, in addition, attacked by a band of brigands, who stole several valuable chests from them.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

This shift, however, in no way denied the fact that the ultima ratio of colonial authority was displayed by European arms.\nAs its most ardent advocates were willing to remark, colonial rule was won by the sword and so maintained. With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property.

More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools. Having lost the traditionality of their positions and roles in the eyes of their people, they were treated in most cases like mere instruments of control by the colonial masters and not as real partners.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.637, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

Your long exposure of the evil of shoving military men into civil offices on the West Coast has had no effect upon the authorities of Lagos. A few days ago a *Lieut.

Now this is too bad—a piece of scandalous jobbing, and a flagrant plunder of a colony that needs every penny of its resources. This Mr. Mayne, late Stipendiary Magistrate, came out to the Coast as steward in a trading vessel, belonging to Steward and Douglas, of Liverpool. He *left* the ship here at Lagos—took to selling rum in bottles and other small affairs, and afterwards became clerk to Mr. M'Coskry. When the cession of Lagos to Great Britain took place, Mr. M'Coskry, becoming Acting Governor, made Mr. Mayne Stipendiary Magistrate. One would have thought that 400l. a year, with etceteras, was pretty well for Mr. Mayne, considering how he came here, and you may imagine what sort of police magistrate's law we have had from him. But I should not have said anything, and let bygones be bygones, but for this outrage on the community—this robbery of the Lagos revenues—in granting him a pension of some 90l. or 100l. a year. As Stipendiary Magistrate he had no right to be engaged in trade; but, Sir, I need not tell you that *Europeans who know how to manage* may do pretty well what they like out here on the West Coast. Why, Sir, the authorities have known all the time that for years past Mr. Mayne, Stipendiary Magistrate, was trading at the same time largely under the title of John Weatherden and Co., and has weathered all our colonial storms so well that there are not a few vessels and cargoes coming in and going out of late belonging altogether to John Weatherden and Co., alias Thomas Mayne, Stipendiary Magistrate. As regards *health*, all I can say is he has so well maintained it that he is quite rosy cheeked in this his supposed pension-justifying illness. The *ill health* is only put on to justify to the Secretary of State this scandalous pension. The fact is that his business as a merchant has increased to such an extent as to render it impossible for him to continue any longer to hold the Stipendiary Magistrateship—but he has not the grace to retire from a position he ought never to have held without sucking 100l. a year out of us, perhaps for the next twenty or thirty years, to add to his large mercantile income.""}, {'id': 1378, 'article_title': 'Another Military Magistrate and Scandalous Pension', 'full_section_title': 'Another Military Magistrate and Scandalous Pension', 'last_edit_date': '07-03-1868', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_08_1868#article-18', 'issue_date': '22_08_1868', 'content': 'But because we do not want any more trading Stipendiary Magistrates, who, being in the receipt of large official salaries, and certain powers given them by their official position, have unfair advantages over the other merchants and traders here, it does not therefore follow that we want West Indian regimental officers to be our police magistrates.

This matter is so important as regards the most vital interests of the colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa that we must be excused for having thus again brought it prominently forward, when about to notice a new appointment by a Local Administrator of a military officer to the responsible civil office of Stipendiary Magistrate. Our reference to our items of Lagos news, our readers will perceive that such an appointment has been made there. That office, from the time of its creation in Lagos, has been filled in a very unsatisfactory manner, and we had hoped that some properly qualified person who had received something of a legal education would now have been selected; instead of which we find the magisterial power entrusted to the hands of a Lieutenant of the 2nd West India Regiment. We know nothing of the officer who has been thus selected; but our experience as regards such appointments warrants us in looking for evil instead of any good results in this instance, since, unfortunately, Halls and Bravos and Skues's must be regarded rather as the rule than the exception in military magistracy on the West Coast of Africa. We do honour Capt. Glover, the Administrator, for the noble report attributed to him by the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for War, on the occasion of his presenting the Army Estimates (see the House of Commons on the night of the 11th inst. (see our extract); that is now the state of Lagos that not one soldier is necessary there; and we can only hope that he meant this statement to include the newly-appointed Stipendiary Magistrate as well as all other officers and all privates of the West India Regiment now in garrison in that place. It may be, however, that as the West India Regiments are to be reduced in number the Lieutenant has been looking out for a civil haven of refuge when relieved from his arduous military duties by the reduction in the number of officers of West India Regiments. If this be the case we shall not be sorry that he finds such a place of rest, provided it be confirmed to him; or he be confirmed in it on the ground of his being really a fit and proper person to occupy it; but we do call upon the noble chief of the Colonial office in Downing-street to satisfy himself fully on this head before making the appointment absolute. The trade of Lagos is rapidly increasing. Lagos is destined to be one of the most important seats of commerce possessed by Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, and must necessarily attract a constantly augmenting number of educated Africans from Sierra Leone and other West Coast settlements to locate themselves there for purposes of trade. It becomes, therefore, a matter of very grave concern in what hands the powers of the stipendiary magistracy erratic, unjustifiable, venomous, and tyrannical official proceedings, it has been for a very long time our painful duty to protest against and denounce; and on whom, in their ignorance of official routine, they expected that a summary retribution would fall, fills their minds with very bitter thoughts. They ask us in no measured terms if it can be possible that this man, whose judicial career among them has inflicted so much injury on individuals, and brought so deep a disgrace on the so-called administration of justice, is still to be left, with all his alleged vindictiveness, in full power among them; and whether there is to be no redress for all injustice and injuries inflicted by Usher, Parker, Elliott, Skues, and their ever-ready official and unofficial instruments of evil. They seem, in their impatience and anger—their just anger—almost to forget that the official nest of unclean birds of prey the dirtiest and most powerful for evil had already taken flight under the facilities afforded by that repeated influence of climate which has been so often a mantle to cover and to hide private excesses and official delinquencies on the West Coast. The most we have yet heard alleged against Mr. Simpson, the present Acting Administrator, is that he is not a man of that mental calibre which so difficult a government as that of the Gold Coast requires, especially at a time when the disputes between the Fantees and Elminas are still unsettled, and those wars and depredations in the Eastern Provinces, which have inflicted such deep injury on Accra and caused such widespread ruin there, are unredressed. There must be, therefore, some little improvement—Captain Russell, too, as Civil Commandant at Accra, seems to have inspired some confidence—although there has not yet been any redress. We therefore hope that our friends will curb their just impatience, however difficult that operation may be to persons who have been so infamously oppressed by official evildoers. They assure us that a full exposé was made to Sir Arthur Kennedy of all the delinquencies and injustices of which they, with so much reason, complain; and we feel confident that if this has been the case, the Governor-in-Chief will have made a full report thereof to the Secretary of State for the Colonies; who, being now something more than a noble amateur carpenter, will, we should hope and believe, authorise such measures and changes as will prove to the suffering people of Cape Coast and Accra that the confidence they reposed in the Governor-in-Chief was most fully justified.""}, {'id': 1561, 'article_title': 'WEST INDIA REGIMENTAL OFFICERS AS MAGISTRATES, &c.', 'full_section_title': 'WEST INDIA REGIMENTAL OFFICERS AS MAGISTRATES, &c.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/22_05_1869#article-17', 'issue_date': '22_05_1869', 'content': 'The West India officers have long been among the most prolific sources of evil—great among the greatest curses on the West Coast of Africa. There is a tendency in the military element everywhere to be despotic and oppressive; and in our West African settlements it has had a pretty good field for the exercise of its selfish energies. In the comparative infancy of the British settlements, when the local revenues were very small, and there were no educated native people, it may have been necessary or convenient to confer certain civil government and magisterial offices upon military men in garrison. But the practice was so injurious that only very extreme necessity could ever justify it; and that necessity no longer anywhere exists. Military ascendancy on the West Coast is an unmitigated evil, and we shall oppose it until it be finally destroyed. If the officers in the British West India regiments employed one after another on the West Coast do not receive pay adequate to their services, let the Imperial Government increase their pay out of its own revenues, and not supplement it by injurious exactions on the revenues of the settlements. The officers of the West India Regiments are, for the most part,* men of very low mental calibre, and of very imperfect education, and among these Major Bravo, now in command in Sierra Leone, is perhaps one of the worst specimens. Is it not, then, a most atrocious injustice that because this creature of Major Blackall, the ex-Governor, was made by him stipendiary police magistrate, that he should still be allowed to insult, in this capacity, the people of Sierra Leone, among whom there are so many men so far his superiors, morally and intellectually, that it would be an insult to them to institute any comparison between him and them? On what possible ground can it be justified that such a man as Major Bravo should be saddled on the Sierra Leone revenues for 600l. a-year, only to extend his sphere of mischief in the capacity of a magistrate, and to give him power to insult such men as Mr. Rainy with impunity, to bring the military into increased odium with the community at large, and the administration of justice into loathing and contempt. To retain such a man in such an office at Sierra Leone, is a most unjustifiable insult to the people, is disgraceful to the British Government, and a gross plunder of the colonial revenues. Then, again, look at the performance of magisterial duties at Cape Coast by Colonel Delamaine Mends. Is not this something at which every man in authority in the office in Downing-street ought to blush (page 128). Does it not exhibit that the system of the British Government in the West African settlements is a system of plunder, and nothing else. If the Acting Administrator has the power to dictate to the magistrate what warrant he shall or shall not grant, and what his decisions are to be, is it not a despicable thing that a man should consent to be such a tool; a discreditable farce that there should be such a magistrate to be paid out of the local revenues at the rate of a guinea per hour? If the Acting Administrator possesses such power, why is it not ordered that he shall himself sit as magistrate, and save to the settlement the pay of a magistrate. It would be much more fair for the Government to say at once to all persons residing there, ""You will please to observe that you are to live under an irresponsible despotism, and to have no will but that of the governor, and no redress for anything you may suffer from him."" Men would be able to understand this; but they cannot understand such a system as actually prevails, while being told at the same time that they are living under the protection of British laws. We are sorry to have to mention the name of Captain Russell, at Accra, in conjunction with two such military magisterial specimens as Major Bravo and Colonel Mends, because we have before heard much in his praise; but ""Roll him out"" is not the sort of language that will cause the Administrator or the administration of justice to be respected. As regards Cape Coast, we cannot understand the necessity of appointing such a man as Colonel Mends to the paid magistracy, while there is such a gentleman resident there as Mr. Francis Chapman Grant, the senior unpaid magistrate of Cape Coast, unless it be that there was a certain sum to be taken out of the colonial chest, and that Colonel Mends was as good a man as any other, regard being had to the overgorged official condition of Mr. Colonial-Surgeon (with eight or ten official etc.\'s) Thomas Jones, to effect the extraction.

The horrible event occurred in the following manner: An individual, named Hassan, of Circassian origin, who left the Military School four years ago with the rank of lieutenant, was appointed to a captaincy in the army of Bagdad. For certain reasons he was retained at Constantinople, where he was variously employed. When Hassan recently received the grade of Adjutant-Major and a post in the Bagdad army, he alleged various pretexts in order not to leave Constantinople, and was imprisoned. He was set at liberty yesterday, in order that he might proceed to his destination to-day (Friday), and on the evening of yesterday he went to the Yali of the Minister of War. Being informed that the Minister was in council with his colleagues at the residence of his Highness Midhat Pacha, the assassin proceeded there. The guards, believing him still to be an aide-de-camp, did not prevent him from entering the Council chamber. Hassan fired point-blank at Hussein Avni Pacha with a revolver, which he had in his pocket. While the other persons present were pressing forward to seize him, Raschid Pacha, Ahmed Agha, servant of his Highness Midhat Pacha, and a soldier shared the same fate as the Minister of War. The Minister of Marine and another soldier were wounded. The assassin has been arrested.""\n\n**CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16 (Afternoon).**—The assassinated Ministers were buried to-day.\n\n**CONSTANTINOPLE, June 16 (Evening).**—Hassan only intended to shoot the Minister of War.

One is the unexpected disturbance on the coast at Benin. The other is the campaign, long prepared, of which the first decisive blow has just been struck by the Royal Niger Company in the interior. That the two crises should have occurred at the same moment is merely fortuitous, and the only connexion between them is such as might result from any embarrassment caused in the rear of the Niger Company's operations by a sympathetic Native revolt along the coast.\n\nThe Benin disturbance, with which the Imperial authorities are directly concerned and for which all necessary steps are about to be promptly taken, is only of the usual order of trouble which is apt to arise upon the Oil Rivers. The Native chiefs of each river-mouth have in turn given occasion for punitive expeditions of which the result is in all cases the same. The offending chief is deposed, military posts are established in his country, and the district is gradually opened to civilised intercourse. The chief of Okrika, on the Bonny river, was deposed for such reasons only a few months ago. There is scarcely an annual report of affairs in the Niger Coast Protectorate which does not include the account of an expedition against one or other of the river chiefs. For some of these the local forces of the Protectorate suffice. Benin is strong enough to require special measures of repression, and as Brass, situated close to the frontier through which the Niger Company's territory passes to the sea, might be disposed to seize the present opportunity for renewed misconduct, the position on the coast is likely to give some occupation to the Imperial squadron in West African waters. Summarised in three sentences, the facts which have to be remembered about the situation on the coast are that, with the exception of the narrow strip through which the territories of the Royal Niger Company find access to the sea, the whole district is under the direct control of the Imperial Government; that any military operations which it may be necessary to undertake are of a character that frequent repetition has rendered more or less familiar, and can be conducted from a sea base; finally, that the disturbance on the coast is separated by about 300 miles of wild country, inhabited by Pagan tribes, from the scene of the Royal Niger Company's campaign in the interior.""}]","[{'document_title': 'THE MILITARY SUPREME COURT JUDGE AT SIERRA LEONE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have before remarked upon military officers sitting as judges in the Stipendiary Magistrates\' Court and in the Supreme Court at Cape Coast. We have especially objected to their doing so, because, among other things, we believe, with Lord Carnarvon, Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, that they are for the most part ""ignorant of the first principles of law."" We consider, then, such employment, wherever there is an educated community, however small, as an outrage to the moral feeling of the people, who would never think of looking to military officers, doing duty at the same time with their regiments in the same locality, for that pure administration of law and justice which is at the root of the public liberties and of social advancement. From the period when judges were made independent of the Crown in this country, and were required to possess great legal learning and unspotted private reputation, from that period the liberties of the land rapidly advanced. The order is as old as the great Roman satirist and poet, that with the avocation of the law, arms should be set aside. But not only has this been ignored at Cape Coast, but the very same thing has been done in what may be now called the Metropolitan West African Colony—Sierra Leone—where the ermine of the Chief Justice has been worn over the red coat of the soldier. We do not at all hesitate to believe our correspondents that in the case of Captain Bravo the feelings of the right-minded citizens were greatly outraged when they saw him placed on the bench as Chief Police Magistrate, invested with power to deal with cases up to the amount of 50l.; and much more so, when he was afterwards promoted to the post of ""Commissioner for executing the duties of Chief Justice,"" in which capacity he has actually tried serious cases of felony, and presided at a trial for murder. We entertain no hostility to Captain Bravo at Sierra Leone, any more than we did toward Captain Hall, or any other captain, lieutenant, or ensign of West India regiments, who may have sat as Stipendiary Magistrate or Chief Justice at Cape Coast. In a word, we have not, nor have we ever had, any personal hostility to any individual in office on the Coast; nor should we ever allow any private feelings to influence us in the discharge of our most responsible duty. But the good of Africa is what we have in view; and we therefore denounce in the strongest manner this very unhealthy state of things—this unmistakable tendency to military usurpation of important civil offices on the West Coast of Africa. Nor do we think that either Colonel Conran at Cape Coast, or Governor Blackall at Sierra Leone, could have so far encroached upon the demesne of the law by the promotion of their military friends to judicial offices, if the late Chief Justice of the Gold Coast, and Mr. Carr, the actual Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, had watched with adequate severity over the dignity of their important office. Law should ever inspire respect; but it is impossible that an intelligent native people can respect, nor can we call upon them to respect, the administration of justice, when they see their appointed judge oscillating between the barrack and the bench; now sitting as Chief Justice, and anon the gay and thoughtless soldier in quarters or on parade. Lord Carnarvon has pointedly deplored the necessary existence of such anomalies in a time of martial law, and of suspension of the organised tribunals, as lately in Jamaica; but they never can and never ought to be permitted to exist with a sound or healthy condition of the body politic. Governor Blackall, as Governor-General of the West Coast Colonies and Settlements, ought especially to set an example to Her Majesty\'s Administrators at other points on the Coast; and we cannot but deplore and condemn his promotion of military men, for however short a period, to high judicial offices. Such an employment of military men is the unerring evidence of despotic tendencies, as we can see from St. Petersburg to Paris, and does not belong to the system of a free Government. Military men in all ages have been the readiest instrument in the support of the civil power, and in their own proper sphere they can be made the preservers of public liberty; but placed outside their sphere and in civil offices, they are the hereditary and consistent enemies of popular rights. The attention of the Colonial-office must be directed to this great abuse in the administration of the law on the West Coast. Some remedy must at once be found. A single instance of this improper military employment might have been passed over as an exception, but the frequent recurrence of such things looks like a purpose and a system; and should this condemnable practice, this great evil, not be otherwise put an end to, the opinion of Parliament must be pronounced upon it.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1866#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Evils and Injustice Requiring Prompt Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The governor-generalship of the West Coast of Africa is a complete failure; experience shows that it does not work well, while it entails a great expense on Sierra Leone, and the only compensation she gets in return is to be called Head-quarters. The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage. The present system is a great injustice to Sierra Leone, and it is high time that it should be remedied.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Civil Appointments to Military Officers', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Colonial Secretary in favour of a military officer on occasions as above alluded to, a Governor takes upon himself by the very act a responsibility of the gravest character; because he thereby lowers the respect due to his Colonial Secretary, and casts so grave a censure on his appointment by the Home Government as to make it incumbent on the latter, if it properly perform its duty and uphold its dignity, to inquire and decide which of the two, the Governor or the Colonial Secretary, should be immediately superseded. This matter is so important as regards the most vital interests of the colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa that we must be excused for having thus again brought it prominently forward, when about to notice a new appointment by a Local Administrator of a military officer to the responsible civil office of Stipendiary Magistrate. Our reference to our items of Lagos news, our readers will perceive that such an appointment has been made there. That office, from the time of its creation in Lagos, has been filled in a very unsatisfactory manner, and we had hoped that some properly qualified person who had received something of a legal education would now have been selected; instead of which we find the magisterial power entrusted to the hands of a Lieutenant of the 2nd West India Regiment. We know nothing of the officer who has been thus selected; but our experience as regards such appointments warrants us in looking for evil instead of any good results in this instance, since, unfortunately, Halls and Bravos and Skues's must be regarded rather as the rule than the exception in military magistracy on the West Coast of Africa. We do honour Capt. Glover, the Administrator, for the noble report attributed to him by the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for War, on the occasion of his presenting the Army Estimates (see the House of Commons on the night of the 11th inst. (see our extract); that is now the state of Lagos that not one soldier is necessary there; and we can only hope that he meant this statement to include the newly-appointed Stipendiary Magistrate as well as all other officers and all privates of the West India Regiment now in garrison in that place. It may be, however, that as the West India Regiments are to be reduced in number the Lieutenant has been looking out for a civil haven of refuge when relieved from his arduous military duties by the reduction in the number of officers of West India Regiments. If this be the case we shall not be sorry that he finds such a place of rest, provided it be confirmed to him; or he be confirmed in it on the ground of his being really a fit and proper person to occupy it; but we do call upon the noble chief of the Colonial office in Downing-street to satisfy himself fully on this head before making the appointment absolute. The trade of Lagos is rapidly increasing. Lagos is destined to be one of the most important seats of commerce possessed by Great Britain on the West Coast of Africa, and must necessarily attract a constantly augmenting number of educated Africans from Sierra Leone and other West Coast settlements to locate themselves there for purposes of trade. It becomes, therefore, a matter of very grave concern in what hands the powers of the stipendiary magistracy erratic, unjustifiable, venomous, and tyrannical official proceedings, it has been for a very long time our painful duty to protest against and denounce; and on whom, in their ignorance of official routine, they expected that a summary retribution would fall, fills their minds with very bitter thoughts. They ask us in no measured terms if it can be possible that this man, whose judicial career among them has inflicted so much injury on individuals, and brought so deep a disgrace on the so-called administration of justice, is still to be left, with all his alleged vindictiveness, in full power among them; and whether there is to be no redress for all injustice and injuries inflicted by Usher, Parker, Elliott, Skues, and their ever-ready official and unofficial instruments of evil. They seem, in their impatience and anger—their just anger—almost to forget that the official nest of unclean birds of prey the dirtiest and most powerful for evil had already taken flight under the facilities afforded by that repeated influence of climate which has been so often a mantle to cover and to hide private excesses and official delinquencies on the West Coast. The most we have yet heard alleged against Mr. Simpson, the present Acting Administrator, is that he is not a man of that mental calibre which so difficult a government as that of the Gold Coast requires, especially at a time when the disputes between the Fantees and Elminas are still unsettled, and those wars and depredations in the Eastern Provinces, which have inflicted such deep injury on Accra and caused such widespread ruin there, are unredressed. There must be, therefore, some little improvement—Captain Russell, too, as Civil Commandant at Accra, seems to have inspired some confidence—although there has not yet been any redress. We therefore hope that our friends will curb their just impatience, however difficult that operation may be to persons who have been so infamously oppressed by official evildoers. They assure us that a full exposé was made to Sir Arthur Kennedy of all the delinquencies and injustices of which they, with so much reason, complain; and we feel confident that if this has been the case, the Governor-in-Chief will have made a full report thereof to the Secretary of State for the Colonies; who, being now something more than a noble amateur carpenter, will, we should hope and believe, authorise such measures and changes as will prove to the suffering people of Cape Coast and Accra that the confidence they reposed in the Governor-in-Chief was most fully justified."", 'last_edit_date': '1869-03-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1869#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—That the settlements in the River Gambia are suffering from being under the management of the Governor of Sierra Leone, or, as he is, in the technical language of Bumbledom, called ""Governor of the West African Settlements,"" is a fact patent to every practical man on the West Coast. That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Military Officer Punished', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Such is our correspondent's letter; and is it not grievous to think that of such officers as this —— civil commandants are made on the West Coast?

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street.

We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust.

The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GERMANS IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Judging from the events of the last few months, the German possessions in Africa are suffering from the lack of a sufficient number of capable administrators.

In the Appendix, No. 29, will be found a return exhibiting the mortality of the navy employed on the West African station, and of that on the North American and West Indian station, in the five years from 1857 to 1861, from which it appears, that whilst the North American and West Indian squadron loses on that station an average of 28·26 per 1,000 of its officers and men, the West African squadron loses on an average 31·14 out of the same number.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

With this dictum in mind, all the European powers utilized in their military establishments elements recruited from the indigenous population. Although organization and effectiveness varied both according to region and particular national purposes, such colonial troops primarily performed police functions in the inter-war era and were joined by newly created constabulary forces in this capacity. Yet because they were frequently made to serve in geographical regions culturally and ethnically unfamiliar to them, African soldiers were thus alienated from their own society and were often received with hostility by the local populations they forcefully encountered. As a result of this condition and, furthermore, of the European denial of command positions to Africans, the army never came to play the political role in the independence movements that its counterparts in Asia and the Near East did.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897.

Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

Some of them, like Samori Ture of the Mandinka empire in West Africa, and Menelik of Ethiopia, had even been able to modernize their armies. Because of this, the African rulers saw no reason why they could not maintain their sovereignty at that time. Furthermore, some thought they could stave off the invaders through diplomacy.

As the distance between the two colonies is but three hundred miles, there would be plenty of time to allow of her performing this service at frequent intervals, without prejudice to her ordinary duties at Lagos.\n\nIt appears from the army estimates for the present year that the proposed military expenditure on the four settlements amounts to £27,897, and that this provides for an effective force of two regiments of black troops, or about 1,800 men.\n\nIt has been already stated that the condition of affairs on the Gold Coast and Lagos is such as to warrant the reduction of the force allotted for their occupation one-half, or by half a regiment; this should effect a corresponding diminution of one-fourth in the amount of the estimate, but so much of this expenditure is caused by the large establishment of staff, which the exigencies of the climate appear to render necessary, that it will not effect anything like this saving.\n\nThe force formerly employed on the coast averaged about 1,000 men, and there seems no reason to suppose that it might not be at once reduced to this amount without exposing the settlements to any risk; further reductions are, however, needed to bring the charge for their defence within reasonable limits, and the readiest mode of effecting this is to be found in the extension to the other settlements, so far as their circumstances warrant, of the system already successfully tried at Lagos, the employment of an armed police force of the natives known as houssas, as auxiliaries to, or even substitutes for, regular soldiers.'}, {'id': 1529, 'article_title': 'Gross Outrage by Administrator Glover', 'full_section_title': 'Gross Outrage by Administrator Glover', 'last_edit_date': '04-23-1869', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1869#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_04_1869', 'content': 'Lagos, March 4, 1869.\n\nSir,—From time to time I have perused in your valuable columns atrocities said to have been committed by British officials on the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia, but I believe that you will agree with me in saying that we can outdo those worthies at this little place from which I now write you.\n\nCaptain Glover, who has had the good fortune to hold the reins of Government here for several years, and the still greater honour of the power of disbursing a great deal of ready cash, which he says he has spent in improving the sand-bank of Lagos, has a predilection (after dinner, mind you), of unceremoniously breaking into merchants\' houses, knocking some down with his\n\nown fists, and at other times resorting to the Domingo Martinez dodge of handcuffing gentlemen, dragging them from their houses through the streets at unheard-of hours of the night, and afterwards locking them up in a hole he has the presumption to call ""Bridewell.""\n\nPray, Sir, do not think I am romancing, because I enclose you a copy of an affidavit sworn to before the Chief Magistrate of this colony, by which you will perceive that on February 19, after his Excellency Captain Glover had dined, he took it (the idea) into his head of despatching some thirty or forty ragamuffins, which, for purposes of his own, he chooses to call ""Houssa armed police!"" to apprehend any one they liked (as they had no legal warrant), which order they carried out admirably, as you will perceive by the copy of affidavit enclosed.

Because, independent of a police-force, and a detachment of one Her Majesty\'s West India Regiments always here, Captain Glover exults in the command of some 300 armed men, which command is at present nominally transferred to a Mr. Rowe, a Staff Assistant-Surgeon in Her Majesty\'s service, with two pieces of Artillery, six horses, a full band, a brass bauble prostituting England\'s Jack on its foreground, and otherwise with all the appurtenances and materiel of a line regiment.) With these he takes an occasional filibustering expedition in neighbouring native territories, for the ostensible purpose of opening up commerce in some unheard-of locality, whilst in reality he succeeds admirably in crippling trade, making the name of Englishmen a word of terror to the natives in the interior; and last, though not least, establishing such a chaos of affairs, that it will soon be indispensably necessary for the Home Government to establish a Court of Bankruptcy amongst us, independent of the Courts of Civil and Criminal Justice now existing.'}, {'id': 2340, 'article_title': 'The Crepee Children Sold as Slaves at Cape Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The Crepee Children Sold as Slaves at Cape Coast', 'last_edit_date': '11-24-1872', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-5', 'issue_date': '30_12_1872', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—Although you may have had but too much cause to blame Mr. Salmon's administration, Mr. Salmon has done one thing worthy of great praise.

The “Africa Order in Council” referred to, deals with all contingencies likely to arise, in minute detail. In a region like that of the Oil Rivers, one cannot expect law and order to be enforced in the same rigid manner as in Europe, or even in the Cape, or an old Crown colony. Much must be left to the Commissioner’s tact and discretion. A body of Haussas are now being enlisted for the police service, and in time we may hope that the law will reach well into the interior, and that free traffic will be carried on without the intervention of middlemen. The numerous creeks and rivers form useful waterways, though they are hotbeds of malaria. It will be the business of the Commissioner and his staff, moreover, to encourage and even carry on experiments in the way of introducing new cultures and new industries. Major MacDonald has been in communication with Kew and with Sir Alfred Moloney, who has done such good work in Lagos. He will take out with him a large supply of seeds of various kinds, and begin by establishing an experimental garden at Old Calabar.\n\nMajor MacDonald’s own head-quarters will be at Old Calabar, where there is some kind of Consular building. But, of course, he will be pretty constantly on the move. His Vice-Consuls will be stationed as follows: General Hammill on the Bonny River; Mr. T. A. Wall at Old Calabar; Captain H. L. Gallwey on the Benin River; Captain F. Synge on the Forcados; Captain MacDonald on the Brass River; Mr. W. Armstrong on the Opobo River. Each of them will, of course, exercise jurisdiction on his own river, but Major MacDonald will be in constant communication with them, and it is hoped that very soon all the rivers will be connected by telegraph. The treasurer of the Commissionership is Mr. J. F. Roberts, while Mr. Tanner is Major MacDonald’s private secretary. There are besides four Consular clerks—Mr. Steains, Mr. C. Harrison, Mr. F. Wilding, and Mr. G. Quilter. This is a large staff, but not too large for the many duties which will have to be performed, in a climate where it is hardly safe to stay for more than a year at a time. It is hoped that the Customs dues to be collected will defray the cost of administration. Of course, the whole arrangement is a compromise. But it is to be expected that in time, under Major Macdonald, the progress made will be such as to justify the taking over of the Oil Rivers as a Crown colony. British connexion with West Africa has had many vicissitudes. Our colonies have been abandoned; have been made over to companies; taken over by the Crown, and generally treated without any sort of continuity of policy. Now that we have put our hands to one of the richest commercial regions on the continent, it is to be hoped we shall persevere in a policy of gradual development.'}]","[{'document_title': 'Mountain Guns for the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The armament of the Houssa Regiment is about to be completed by Her Majesty's Government, who are now sending out a double battery of light mountain guns.

When the whole of the Niger region is confederated under Imperial rule the region stretching west and north-west from the mouths of the great river may become extremely valuable to British commerce. As it is, a work of great importance has just been concluded in the interests of England. The encroachments of the French on our West African sphere are well known to those who have been watching events in that part of the world. Their evident aim was so to surround our four little colonies as to shut them out completely from the interior, and ruin them so far as their trade goes. Fortunately, H.E. Alfred Moloney, Governor of Lagos, saw clearly what the policy of the French was, and from his knowledge of the country and people was able to take steps to preserve for Lagos a free route to the interior and the commerce of the native markets, and to bring a large and valuable country within the sphere of British influence. Practically the whole of the fine Yoruba country has been attached and free access obtained to and beyond the Kong Mountains, and to the sphere of the Royal Niger Company. Governor Moloney deserves to be congratulated on having accomplished this delicate task.\n\nHis report on Lagos for 1888, just issued, is voluminous and abounds in information as to the condition of the colony. He begins with a useful comparative statement of the tariffs of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gold Coast, Lagos, the intervening French and German possessions, and the Royal Niger Territory. Lagos was acquired by treaty in 1861, and the report embodies figures showing its growth since. The revenue for 1887 came to £51,347, while the expenditure reached...\n163\n\n£78,610. The excess represented exceptional outlay from the credit funds of the colony on increased and necessary accommodation. The credit of the colony, represented by its investments, &c., amounted, on the close of the year, to £38,059.\n\nThe colony is self-dependent as regards its defence. Its force consists of Houssas (Mohammedans) and Yorubas, numbers some 400, and costs nearly £12,000 per annum.\n\nIt is satisfactory to notice the addition to the fixed establishments of provision for a botanical station as a distributing centre for economic plants of commercial value. The history of this important measure and the progress attained has appeared in the monthly bulletin of the Royal Gardens, Kew, from which it would appear we are indebted for so important a work to Governor Moloney, who has himself published a useful handbook on West African Forestry.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AN UNRIVALLED POLICE', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'If it were not that life and property are endangered, and British rule disgraced by such a state of things as that described by our correspondents, ""The Merchants and Traders of Lagos,"" there really is matter in that description so extravagantly ridiculous, that it would be difficult to write seriously about the Lagos Police Force. What sort of administration of government that can be, which remains apathetically indifferent in presence of a police thus organized or disorganized, is what we cannot understand. We suppose a regular Police force is necessary in Lagos, though we should have been inclined to fancy that a constabulary, with night police, on the old English plan, would have been in very many respects better, as helping to educate the responsible people in the place in the working of free institutions. A Police system, as we understand and have applied it in Great Britain, is a necessary attendant on large and dense populations and advanced civilization, but does not appear to us to be necessary where the conditions of population are such as in Lagos—in which place it seems not to have had any other public utility than to assist the authorities in squandering the public revenues. Three European inspectors and three native inspectors mounted, and with horse allowance of some 45l. a-year each, in addition to salaries scandalously large in comparison with any duties they could possibly have to perform, in a place where the educated population may be counted on one\'s fingers! It would have been bad enough if these men were merely respectable well-behaved nonentities, setting good moral and social example, while depleting the overgorged treasury; but when we look at them in the light in which they are exhibited to us by our correspondents, the matter becomes so much the worse, that, to use the words of one of them in a private letter, ""it is a deplorable scandal, disgraceful to every one connected with it."" ""The cry is great,"" he continues, ""and I ought to state very much more than I have done; but I forbear for decency sake."" We think we see these gentlemen inspectors in ""patent leather boots, with bouquet in button-hole of Oxford or cut-away coat, and cigar in mouth, parading about on horseback, with an attendant policeman as orderly, to hold their horses while they are passing their time with their frail female friends."" If on no other ground than this, that useful reformer, Governor Pope Hennessy, wisely performed his duty when he knocked off all these attendant orderlies in 1872, as we are informed he did; although the inspectors have since ""quietly and cunningly, one by one, resumed them—at the public expense of course—and dare to use them, too, for all their own private work and purposes."" Another correspondent, writing on the same subject, says: ""If they must have horses, and grooms to walk about after them to hold those horses, let these be their own grooms, and not policemen. A groom\'s pay, with a grass man and corn expenses, are only about 2l. a month; and the horse allowance being 3l. 17s. 6d. per month, they could even then make a large profit on it."" We, for our part, do not believe in any necessity for this mounted police; but if some be indispensable, certainly Lagos cannot want more than two of them.

After three weeks on board ship, we were glad to get ashore at Accra. On landing, I was taken to Christiansborg, and introduced to the Governor and other officials. Having got into harness, I began my duties, and found that my mode of conveyance from one place to another was by go-cart. The arrangement consists of a small hand-cart on two wheels, drawn, as a rule, by one Kroo boy, and pushed behind by another, or a couple more. I was not a little surprised and pleased to find, on my first visit (Saturday), that cricket was going on, the match being Whites v. Blacks. Some of the Natives play very well, and take great interest in the game. After about a month\'s stay I started on my first trip through the bush. A hammock and eight carriers, besides six men for carrying luggage, are allowed for this expedition; and one is carried, lying full length in the hammock, at the rate of about four miles an hour. Having received instructions, I pushed on as fast as possible to take over the duties of Commissioner for a large district. These duties are many, and not at all times the most pleasant. They consist, in the first place, of magisterial work—i.e., sitting daily in court and distributing justice to the offenders; next, coroner\'s work; also performing marriages, accounting for all moneys received in Customs duties, paying all officials in the district, and if belonging to the constabulary, commanding the Hausas and civil police at the station. In fact, a District Commissioner is monarch of all he surveys. Some of those holding the office are Natives. After three months of such work, I was ordered into Accra. The Hausa force, composed of European and Native officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, are well able to hold their own, as far as Native troops go. The Native officers are fine men, nearly all having seen service, and wearing medals for campaigns as well as for distinguished conduct in the field. The non-commissioned officers and men receive extra pay for good conduct. Several of the non-commissioned officers have been to England, for instruction at Hythe, Shoeburyness, and Knellar Hall; and it is the custom to send a number every year at the expense of the Colony. One company is told off as gunners, and work the several 7-pounders, &c., receiving extra pay. The drums and fifes are very good; and the buglers it would be hard to beat. The headquarters are at Accra, but there are detachments at all the large stations. One sees the value of the Hausas when they are sent on an expedition, no commissariat or baggage-waggons being required. The men are simply paid 3d. a day as subsistence money, and they find themselves. They are well drilled, and are armed with the Martini-Henry short carbine for bushwork. The whole, or nearly the whole, of the Hausa force are Mohammedans, and their souls are cared for by their priests, who belong to the force, and are paid by the Colony. The men are recruited from the following tribes, viz.: Hausa, Wongora, Dagomba, Meshi, Fulas, Dagotahs, Grunshis, Grumas, and Yombas. The civil police force consists of about 350 men, mostly Fantis. They are in uniform, and perform the duties of policemen, as at home. There are an inspector and two sub-inspectors at the head of the civil police, and the work is carried on as satisfactorily as can be expected out of the material provided.

The charge for the fixed civil establishments and for miscellaneous services shows a large increase, a considerable portion of which was for additional offices, and, in some instances, for augmentations of salaries; whilst the outlay on police, and especially for the armed police, which have been raised for the protection of the settlement, in consequence of the small military force appropriated for the purpose, has been attended with heavy expense. On the whole, the expenditure does not show an excess over the revenue, though it is necessary to observe that this does not accurately represent the financial condition of the settlement, since it appears by the Return No. 28 (Appendix) that there has been incurred, in addition to the recorded expenditure, a debt of 4,224l., partly for the hire and expense of a steamer, which was rendered necessary by the withdrawal of one of the men-of-war hitherto appropriated for the purpose, and also by the heavy expenditure for works and buildings which was required on the establishment of the government. The recent depressed state of trade has also temporarily affected the receipts from revenue, and rendered necessary the borrowing of a small sum for current expenses.\n\nAlthough it is clear that the first formation of a new colony, especially in such a situation as Lagos, must have involved very heavy demands upon the public purse, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the 45,874l., which was the amount raised from revenue in the two years and a-half it has been in existence, would have been found sufficient to effect all that was most wanted without involving the settlements in any debt.

It is proposed to reconstruct the dilapidated forts in all the settlements, and to erect fresh fortifications where they may be needed; and, besides this, it is in contemplation to increase the number of troops in Africa by the amalgamation of two or more regiments into one. Public attention being directed to the subject of defences, the importance of reorganizing the Militia which existed some years ago has been mooted by the local Press. In the first place, a Militia in the colony could be utilized in the event of any sudden outbreak in Africa requiring a large number of troops for an expedition or as a reserve force. It would also serve to protect the settlement from any hostile attack that might be directed against it. In the second place, its organization would preclude the necessity of augmenting the number of Regular troops to be stationed in Africa. The scheme for protection has been sufficiently matured to come into operation. The people of the Gold Coast have simultaneously applied for permission to establish a Rifle Corps as a Volunteer force for the protection of the colony—an organization similar in its details to the English Militia, and one whose importance has been recognized by Sir Garnet Wolseley.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British Expedition in West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The expedition sent to avenge Captain Dalrymple's death consisted of 175 Houssa troops, under the command of Captain C.

At one time the force under Commissioner Williams and Captain Akers numbered about 1,000 men. The towns marched against were two adjacent places, each named Taviewe, to which the murderers belonged. The natives were aware of the approach of the English, and had made preparations to meet them. It was found, as the expedition marched nearer the first town, that the enemy were in ambuscade parties very numerous. The first force met with were driven from their position and fell back on the second. On both sides of the road the parties were posted. The Houssas had four 7-pounder cannon and a rocket trough. These they used effectively as they went between the two fires. The enemy were at last beaten completely, and made no stand at the entrance of the town, which the British force entered with very little opposition. They had a similar experience at the second town, which was taken in a few hours after the first. On the British side ten Houssas were killed and about fifty of the friendly allies. The enemy, however, suffered severely, and it was estimated that at least 500 were killed. The natives had a good supply of powder, but it seems that it got wet.

It was governed by its native king, who was placed on the throne, after the expulsion of the usurper, by the efforts of the British squadron, and was maintained in that position by the same power, and lastly it had the assistance, as British Consuls, of men of ability and local experience, who exerted themselves in every way to promote its prosperity and advancement.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust.

The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa.

Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army.

He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': ""As noted above, the critical factor in the changing balance of power in Africa in the 1870s was not the troops, nor their training and discipline or generalship, but the quality and quantity of the guns available to the respective sides. The ultimate answer in the contest for power in Africa therefore depended on the monopolization of arms and ammunition. This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act. By this device also, while constantly fighting African states and negotiating various treaties and conventions with African rulers, they could pretend that, by owning slaves and dealing in slaves, African states enjoyed no recognition in international law. It was thus possible to pretend in the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 and the Brussels Act of 1889 that in international law Africa was a terra nullius and only European powers and settlers had interests there that had to be protected."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

In a statement frequently referred to as most descriptive of the methods which the French actually pursued in this region between the wars, the Governor-General of French West Africa, Joost Van Vollenhoven, remarked in 1917: The chiefs 'have no power of their own, for there are not two authorities in the cercle ... ; there is only one! Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization. The egregious exception, however, was South Africa where the concept of'native authority' was the means by which the white minority assured local administration of Africans now displaced by the policy of segregation to territorial reserves."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""With the establishment of European administration, chiefs were manipulated as if they were administrative personnel who might be reposted or removed to satisfy colonial needs. Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': 'rulers.

Conscious of their weakness, the chiefs and people have expressed to the Governor a desire to live under British rule, the simplest mode of effecting which would be by the cession of their country, but this is impracticable, from the fact that they are shareholders.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast.

It is a fact well within the knowledge of all interested in the welfare of the oldest British colony in Africa that for some years past the French, by means of treaties made with the chiefs of the Upper Niger and Western Soudan, have been gradually encroaching upon the hitherto not very well-defined boundaries of the Colony of Sierra Leone, with the result of gradually reducing the British sphere of influence, and at the same time narrowing the field from which the merchants and traders of that Colony draw their native produce, and in which, in return, they have been in the habit of finding a market for their imported goods. Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary. Our trade with Sierra Leone is mainly dependent upon the caravan traffic between the British port of Freetown and the upper portion of the Niger.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH TRADE ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""So much for the western frontier. On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear. This was the reason why the development of that great continent was so far behind hand.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by Admiral Field, M.P., seconded by Mr. Johnson (of the Stanley Falls, Congo):—', 'last_edit_date': '1890-07-18', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1890#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Commercial Value of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Altogether our West African possessions do a trade with Great Britain (mainly with Liverpool, London, and Bristol) of about £5,000,000 yearly, give honourable employment to some 770 of our British fellow-countrymen, and bring at least 5,000,000 of intelligent (Sierra Leone), sturdy (Krumen), industrious (Gold Coast), artistic (Yoruba), brave (Niger), good-tempered (Oil Rivers) negroes under our sway. I have dwelt more in detail on the extent of our interests in West Africa than on those which we possess in other parts of the Continent, because it is with West Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are most concerned. I mean that the trade of our West African possessions, and the employment given to British subjects, are directed almost solely to Great Britain. If we gave away the Gold Coasts or Lagos, or the Niger, for instance, in exchange for concessions from France or Germany in the Pacific or the North Atlantic, the ratio of loss to the inhabitants of Great Britain would be far greater than the gain to the Australians or the Newfoundlanders. To those who argue that our missionaries and merchants might go on working in West Africa just the same, even if the rule in our possession were transferred to another Power, I would ask, \'How many British merchants are there in French Senegambia? What is the total of British trade with the French, German, Belgian, Portuguese possessions in West Africa as compared to that carried on with the districts under the British flag? Are the British missionaries able to conduct their evangelisation in French Africa? In the most enlightened and liberal-minded of these foreign administrations, the German possession of Cameroons, did not the English Baptist Mission, who had laboured there for forty years prior to the German advent, have to leave the country after the German rule was established?\' We should not blame the Governments of foreign powers for these results. The fault lies in our peculiar idiosyncrasies as a people. We are of a cranky, self-willed, unaccommodating disposition, tolerably patient under the government of our own fellow-countrymen, but utterly impatient of foreign control. While, however, our possessions of Western Africa are become a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London, our newly-gained spheres of influence in South Central Africa—besides the important Scotch interests which they concern—are a necessity for the commercial expansion and feeding-ground of our growing British South African Confederation, which has a total population of over 2,000,000, and does a yearly trade with the United Kingdom of £18,000,000 in value. Then as to Zanzibar and British East Africa, they, in their turn, besides securing the southern approach to the dominions of our Egyptian ward, are a necessity to the trade and overflow emigration of our great Indian Empire, with its nearly 300,000,000 of people and its yearly trade with the British Empire of some £90,000,000. The trade of the British Empire with British Africa amounts to about £25,200,000 yearly. Among the more valuable products which British Africa sends us, or supplies to herself, may be cited the following: gold, silver, copper, coal, diamonds, ivory, rubber, palm oil, palm kernels, gums, cotton, dyewoods, indigo, coffee, sugar, rice, Indian corn, horses, cattle, donkeys, hides, amomum seeds, red peppers, and many other valuable dyes, spices, oils, timber, drugs, skins, and farinaceous foods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1890#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ENGLAND AND HER WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Turning to the question of the political administration of the Colonies at the present time, he enumerated the different systems of government prevailing in the various British Colonies in Africa, and said that the great benefits derived by the Colonies from their annexation to England, whose constitutional monarchy was the most stable system of representative government to be found in the whole world, were conspicuous and great. England had extended to her West African dependencies the privileges of British legitimate trade and commerce, which was a powerful vehicle for the advancement of civilisation.\n\nBringing forward the commercial advancement of the West African Colonies, he said the question had often been asked, ""Do the Colonies pay?"" He could answer with an emphatic affirmative. In 1837 the total external trade of England with all the Colonies was £28,341,471; it was now nearly £300,000,000, thus showing an increase of about ten times. The British shipping in connexion with the Colonies in 1837 was 3,677,975 tons; in 1885 it was 56,611,075 tons. The English Customs returns reckoned the exports to the Colonies in 1837 at £11,283,363; and this had since risen to £54,545,553. Her Majesty\'s Colonies, he said, furnished more than a quarter of the whole world\'s annual supply of gold. He then referred to the commercial geography of the British African Colonies, gave the value of their exports and imports, and reviewed the trade generally. The construction of a railway to the interior of Africa from Lagos was a recent proposition and a new feature in the history of the West African Colonies. It was obvious that Africa was, or would be, the only continent open for the future expansion of British manufacture; in such a case the interior would play an important part. He maintained, with eminent authorities on the subject, that by native agency alone, under foreign supervision necessarily, could tropical Africa be gradually and definitely developed on any permanent basis, and that the negro should be educated industrially and otherwise with the generous help of Europe and America. Whatever was accomplished by native agency, England certainly should carry the credit of effecting such accomplishment in the civilisation of Africa. It was beyond doubt that the English were acknowledged the best colonisers; and the marked consideration invariably shown by them to the people whom they undertook to govern, the extreme liberty and entire privileges of a British subject extended to every native, and the judicious caution characteristic of the policy of the British Government had altogether won for England this success and the preference to all other civilised nations.

Why have we not been in Bambara years ago? A light railway should have been run up to the north-east. The French are outstripping us along the line, and they deserve to; for St. Louis alone is an example of their superiority to us as colonisers. They are tapping all that rich region while we remain inert.\n\nWest Africa has, from interested motives, been represented as unhealthy for Europeans. This illusion is being rapidly dispelled by disinterested travellers. The Englishman, through unhealthy habits, may dig his own grave even in England, as so many thousands do annually. Besides, were London as innocent of sanitary arrangements as Freetown, it would soon become the white man\'s grave in grim reality. A man unaddicted to drink and gluttony may live, and does live, an enjoyable life in West Africa; he enjoys it so much that, like Emin Pasha, he refuses to be rescued.

Some of these vegetable products grow wild. Horses, camels, and sheep, can be bred in the north-east. The list of articles to be found on the coast reads like the inventory of a Liverpool warehouse.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home.

In former times we had the unscrupulous scoundrels and pirates who carried on the slave trade between West Africa and America. To them succeeded the scarcely more polished ""palm oil ruffians""—the masters and crews of the sailing vessels which would anchor for about a year in some one of the Oil Rivers, fill up their ships with native produce, and then sail away again. The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

The advance made during the closing year relates chiefly to East Africa, where the German East African Company has continued its career of activity. Several additions have been made to the vast region under Germany's protection in that part of the Dark Continent, and, what is more, steps have been taken to accelerate the development of the lands acquired, and to prepare the way for trade. One of the latest East African acquisitions of importance is the Vitu region, the protection of which has been arranged by the German Colonial Association; but since this land was secured the East African Company has added to its possessions, the fresh acquisition taking in Port Durnford and a considerable stretch of coastland. Steps are now being taken to form a plantation company which will carry on operations in East Africa, and will cultivate tobacco, cotton, cocoa, &c. As yet great difficulty has been experienced in regard to the labour question. The natives are well behaved, but they do not show any inclination to work unless for the satisfaction of immediate needs, and directly these needs are covered, they betake themselves to idleness. This difficulty was, of course, foreseen, and it is probable that it will take a long time to train the blacks to like or even tolerate continuous labour.\n\nIn West Africa, the Cameroon Colony is progressing satisfactorily.

But as the 1870s gave way to the 1880s, it became increasingly clear that rather than suppressing mere rebellions on the island, the Malagasy army was going to be required for the defence of the country against French intervention.\nIn order to improve its image abroad, the Malagasy government banned the traffic in liquor, particularly rum. In fact, in 1863, believing that the consumption of alcohol had been responsible for Radama IPs misconduct, the new government had decreed that the sovereign should not drink strong liquor. Customs such as tangena (or trial by ordeal) were abolished during Radama II's reign. The slave trade remained outlawed in Madagascar, although some foreign traders, particularly British and French nationals, continued in defiance of this law to trade slaves especially on the western coast of the island. In 1877 the Malagasy government also freed the Makoa, or Masombiky as they were referred to by the Merina, that is, all the slaves or descendants of the slaves who had been brought into Madagascar from the African mainland. Short of the abolition of slavery itself, the decree of 1877, which meant a great economic loss to the owners of the estimated 150000 slaves who were freed, constituted a major social revolution and an indication of the country's determination to modernize itself.62"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.601, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country offering uncoordinated resistance to colonial conquest > The resistance of the independent peoples', 'content': ""The conquest of Menabe, a large and well-organized kingdom, began in 1897, and was to be the practical illustration of the policy devised by GalliØni with the threefold aim of isolating and wearing down the main enemy, the centralized Merina authority; of fostering the political autonomy of the main regions of the island against Imerina, in accordance with the 'divide and rule' principle; and of taking advantage ofthat autonomy to bring about colonization at the least possible cost.$^{22}$ King Toera and his principal chiefs, who were assembled at Ambiky, were said to be making ready to lay down their arms, but Major GØrard, who was in charge of the operation, preferred to invest the capital rather than accept their submission and to 'massacre all the Sakalava who could not escape, including King Toera'. This cruel and underhand act strengthened the resolve of the Sakalava, and a well-organized resistance movement, led by Ingereza, the brother and successor of Toera, spread throughout the Menabe and lasted until 1902. The peoples of Antandroy and Mahafale in the south also opposed French attempts at penetration and only submitted in 1904.\nAs a result of his policy of gradual annexation and after a long period of colonial penetration, GalliØni was able to claim in 1904 or thereabouts that the unification of the island was complete. There was not a single part of the island that escaped the authority of Antananarivo and all the regions acknowledged the power of the colonizers.

It was so vague and ambiguous that it was interpreted by both parties as each saw fit. The treaty granted France the right to 'represent Madagascar in all its foreign relations' and to maintain a resident-general with a military escort at Antananarivo. It granted French nationals the right to obtain long-term leases of up to ninety-nine years and the French navy the right to occupy Diego Suarez, while the French government was awarded an indemnity of ten million francs. This treaty, in which there is no mention of the word 'protectorate', recognized Queen Ranavalona as sovereign of the entire island and as sole owner of land. The 'Appendix' or explanatory letter which the prime minister demanded and secured from the French negotiators on 9 January 1886, before agreeing to ratify the treaty, laid down the powers of the resident-general, fixed the size of his military escort at fifty men, and described the limits of the territory of Diego Suarez as being one nautical mile to the south and west and four miles to the north. These terms were meant to limit the scope of the treaty. The French administration, on the other hand, attached no significance to the 'Appendix' and interpreted the agreement concluded on 17 December 1885 as being a protectorate treaty. By contrast, the Malagasy government, which was dominated by Rainilaiarivony, refused to consider the document as a treaty establishing a protectorate over the island and put forward a quite different interpretation of the document, in opposition to the French schemes. This interpretation was based on constant references to the 'Appendix', which had limited the scope of the clauses that were regarded as being prejudicial to the independence of the kingdom. The rulers in Antananarivo accordingly attempted to prevent the protectorate from coming into being by playing on the differences between the French and the Malagasy texts and the clarifications spelt out in the additional protocol. 10 Thus, a war of attrition came to be waged between the prime minister and successive residents-general as misunderstandings continued to multiply.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858.

This policy, coinciding as it did with Radama's own determination to expand to the east, was to have, as one writer has put it, 'important consequences for the future of Madagascar'. 12 After several friendly contacts, Farquhar sent a diplomatic mission, led by Captain Le Sage, which arrived in Antananarivo on 21 December 1816.

For this purpose a combined caravan of some 1,500 men stationed at Kwa-Sundu [later Mumia] was marched upon them.

The matter with the Commodore had to deal with was, therefore, a delicate one, and one that, if the possibility of doing an injustice was to be avoided, required equally delicate handling. Rumours had reached us, and we think could scarcely have failed to reach the Commodore, that the steamer Sultan of Sockatoo had provoked the natives to hostility by repeated acts of injustice and violence. Of course, neither we nor Sir William Hewett could tell whether this were true; but, as we suggested in a previous article, it was, seeing that there were such rumours, a case in which inquiry ought to precede action. But how did the Commodore inquire? Of the captain and crew of the Sockatoo, no doubt, because he ascended the river in that vessel, making it his flag-ship. And this is where we think Sir William acted thoughtlessly and imprudently. By thus hoisting his flag on board the merchant steamer—the steamer charged with offence, the steamer that had been attacked—he identified himself at once in the eyes of the natives with the steamer against which they had been involved in hostilities. It was impossible for the natives to suppose otherwise than that the Commodore had entirely espoused the cause of the Sockatoo, and come, not to inquire in order that justice might be done, but to punish only; by which he himself provoked the new hostility which he could not, as a British naval commander, do other than signally punish. We are grieved that we feel compelled to take this view. We would have British national action always just as well as decisive; and in this case, so far as the intelligence we have enables us to judge, we feel a doubt as to the action being just. It is very important that the trade in the River Niger should be developed, by the constant presence of purchasers of produce and sellers of goods on board merchant steamers. There can be no real development unless there be peace in the river; there cannot be peace unless there be strict justice, as well as firmness and power to resist wrong, on the part of the traders. We know how prone the natives are to aggression, but at the same time we know, and they know, the power of an armed steamer to be so great, that we do not think they would wantonly provoke that power. As there is no British consular authority in the river to whom the natives, if aggrieved, could make complaint against the armed traders, and as it is most important that there should not be any disputes with the natives of a nature to render necessary the visit of British ships of war at great risk to the health and lives of officers and men, we had hoped that Sir William Hewett's expedition would have been characterized by such prudence and evident impartiality, that the punishment he might have found it necessary subsequently to inflict should have been past all question on the score of justice. We contend that Sir William rendered this impossible by hoisting his flag on board the Sockatoo, and must repeat that his having so done causes us deep regret, because it seems to us to be very reprehensible.""}]","[{'document_title': ""M'CARTHY'S ISLAND TO BE ABANDONED."", 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—Although you have long since stated the fact in your columns, I cannot express how utterly astonished the merchants at Bathurst, and the inhabitants of M'Carthy's Island were when it was reported by the last month's mail that the Government had been recommended to withdraw the troops from that place. Situate nearly 200 miles from the nearest British settlement, and surrounded by a wild Mohammedan tribe, it is no wonder that the people should ever despair of remaining in peace. M'Carthy's Island is a point of civilization in central Africa, and although it is truly a most unhealthy place for European and even native constitutions, yet still it must be stated that its total abandonment will be most mischievous to merchants, traders, and freed slaves, who have long been established there. When the troops are entirely withdrawn, incalculable evil will surely be the consequence. No slave can again expect to have protection—those who have been freed might return to slavery, if their former masters have pluck enough to come to the islands and demand them. British influence will die away, and life and personal property be utterly insecure, unless the colony increase their police in number and efficiency, or re-establish a good militia force, composed of young and active men.\n\nThe great expense of M'Carthy's Island is in the keeping up of the full staff of the military department. Let the number of men be reduced from forty to twelve rank and file—viz., one sergeant, one corporal, and ten privates, and under the sergeant's command. Let an assistant-surgeon, who would also render his services to the poor in the place, be appointed the civil commandant. Let the merchants pay all the civil expenses, and guarantee a sufficient and cheap supply of provision for the troops. Let the contract for beef be abolished. Let the Dover be sent up without fail every month, and then there will be no reason for any anticipated outbreak amongst the Mohammedan tribes.\n\nThe following is a copy of a petition of the inhabitants of M'Carthy's Island to the Hon.

That your petitioners beg to lay before you the great mischief which will accrue from it, and the utter hopelessness of their ever remaining in peace and quietude after the step is carried out.\n\n3. That M'Carthy's Island is surrounded by a warlike Mohammedan tribe, who, not long ago, in spite of the presence of a large military detachment, formed a scheme to attack the island, massacre the whole inhabitants, and pillage the town, but that they were fortunately discovered after 300 armed men had actually landed on the island."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

At Lagos the Admiralty has hitherto supplied the service of two gun-boats, which have been employed in the navigation of the lagoons, and in communicating with vessels outside the entrance.\n\nFrom the shallowness of the water of the lagoons it is necessary that the vessel employed in their navigation should have a very light draft of water, whilst, for going outside, the heavy sea that prevails on the bar necessitates the employment of a larger and deeper steamer.\n\nAlthough two vessels are thus required for the use of the settlement, it would be quite possible to dispense with the services of the larger, except at particular periods; for example, when the arrival of the mail, men-of-war, or store-ships, &c., was expected; but during these intervals she might proceed to the Gold Coast, and afford the Governor of that settlement an opportunity of visiting some of his numerous out-stations. As the distance between the two colonies is but three hundred miles, there would be plenty of time to allow of her performing this service at frequent intervals, without prejudice to her ordinary duties at Lagos.\n\nIt appears from the army estimates for the present year that the proposed military expenditure on the four settlements amounts to £27,897, and that this provides for an effective force of two regiments of black troops, or about 1,800 men.\n\nIt has been already stated that the condition of affairs on the Gold Coast and Lagos is such as to warrant the reduction of the force allotted for their occupation one-half, or by half a regiment; this should effect a corresponding diminution of one-fourth in the amount of the estimate, but so much of this expenditure is caused by the large establishment of staff, which the exigencies of the climate appear to render necessary, that it will not effect anything like this saving.\n\nThe force formerly employed on the coast averaged about 1,000 men, and there seems no reason to suppose that it might not be at once reduced to this amount without exposing the settlements to any risk; further reductions are, however, needed to bring the charge for their defence within reasonable limits, and the readiest mode of effecting this is to be found in the extension to the other settlements, so far as their circumstances warrant, of the system already successfully tried at Lagos, the employment of an armed police force of the natives known as houssas, as auxiliaries to, or even substitutes for, regular soldiers.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.629, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

With improved administration will, no doubt, come an improved revenue, and the time may not be far distant when under such circumstances they will be able to bear the whole cost of their Government; for the present, however, aid must be continued to be given them, and when it is noticed (Return, No. 31, Appendix) that of the £89,500 which is the total cost of their establishments, they raise £77,000, leaving but £12,500 to be supplied from Imperial funds, it must be admitted that according to their means they contribute fairly to the expense of their administration.\n\nIf, however, the proposed reductions of the military establishments be carried into effect, there will result a very large saving to the Imperial Government on this head, and it may be presumed that should inquiry establish the propriety of retaining the settlements, such assistance will be afforded as may be necessary to place them in a position to discharge efficiently, though economically, the important objects for which they will be maintained.—I have, &c.,\n\n(Signed) H.

She was, however, subsequently given up, not before her back had been frightfully cut with the cat.\n\nSoon after (the disease seeming to be infectious) a party in ambush on the left bank of the river seized two palm wine makers, on the ground that the inhabitants at Macarthy\'s had worked in their ground without paying the rent, and fired across the river and wounded one of the inhabitants of the island. Lieutenant Osborne, with his detachment and a Volunteer force, invaded the country, and stood before the fortified town of Burabah Cundah, and after long palavering the men were giving up.\n\nUnfortunately for our policy on the river, we irritate and cause the chiefs to hate us, instead of being peaceful and conciliatory. For two years the King of Catabar, Sunkary Saballey, had not received his ""customs"" from us.

The Marabout chiefs, who once received custom, have not also received any. The result is, that they are bitter against the British subjects, and would give no protection to their commerce. If they are maltreated, they will receive no redress from the chief. The Marabouts at Coonting have now commenced their marauding expedition; they have unsuccessfully attacked Sarmey, a Soninkee town in Catabar\'s territory, and intend to disturb the whole of the towns here after the rains.\n\nJust at the time when the troops are being withdrawn from Macarthy\'s Island our policy should be to encourage friendship amongst the neighbouring tribes; but we have just done the opposite, by refusing to give the King of Catabar his custom, and caused an ill feeling against the people of the islands amongst the Soninkees and Marabouts.\n\nThe captain and crew of the Dover are to be paid off—the latter is now an accomplished fact.

A post is to be established at a distance of about a day and half by water from the mouth of the river. The Natives here are very hostile, and, though it would be easy to subjugate them, it is apprehended that they would immediately retreat into the interior, to the detriment of the commercial enterprises in course of operation. M. Langheld, director of the factories of the Société Anonyme Belge in the region of the Falls, assured the Governor-General that if he were supported by a post in the region of the Lower Lomani he should be able gradually to establish relations with the tribes further up, and finally rally all the population to the State. All the factories of the company are to be similarly protected by the soldiers of the State. A transport service has been organised to the Upper Ituri, and it is pointed out that at Avakubi, where Stanley found himself six years ago in a starving condition, 300 loads can now be sent out per month. In remounting the Falls to Basoko the Governor-General stopped at Isangi. Here the inhabitants within a very large area had offered their submission to Lieut. Arns, the officer in command.\n\nThe report concludes with a satisfactory account of the relations between the Natives and the authorities of the State.

H. M. STANLEY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""There would constantly be an immense quantity of goods going up country by rail. At present, on the Upper Congo, Europeans have to content themselves with living in wattled huts or mud forts, roofed over with straw and grass, and there is, of course, great danger from fire. By means of the railway the State could at once transport about a dozen iron stations; and there would soon be erected houses, churches, and schools, all of iron. Then the native chiefs, seeing what the Europeans were doing, would build iron houses, and would likewise require iron warehouses for their goods. The Chief of Kintamo, for instance, already keeps all his goods in iron boxes; while the Chiefs of Old Calabar live in iron houses which have cost from £1,000 to £3,500 each. Then, again, there would be many steamers to be transported in sections, to be put together on the upper side of the cataracts. On the Upper Congo there are at present only seven steamers, mostly steam launches, but to carry on the enormous trade of the 7,000 miles of navigable waterway of the Upper Congo, large and swift steamers will be required, capable of stowing cargo and carrying passengers in comfort. Again, there would be a large trade in timber, and saw-mills would be required to cut it up, which mills would have to be taken up country by railway. Enormous quantities of powder and large numbers of flint-lock guns would also be in demand. All this is without counting the almost limitless trade to be done in cloth goods. I should say that within a reasonable number of years after the making of the railway there would be a trade of about £10,000,000 annually with the natives of the Upper Congo—all in barter.""\n\nPausing here, Mr. Stanley went on to say that there was a sentimental side to the whole question which was worthy of reflection. ""We have been enabled,"" he continued, ""with our own modest enterprise to secure something like 1,000 carriers a month to serve us in a country that, when I began work there, absolutely refused to have anything to do with us. Already we have some 400 native soldiers—all of which proves that the natives are friendly and willing to lend their services to the white man for his purposes. When the State can better afford it—which will be not long after the railway is finished—it will be able to enlist 3,000 or 4,000 native soldiers for the protection of the country against the slave-traders. Those stations which are to-day so modest and unoffending, and dare not take arms in their hands against the organized slave-traders, will, in a few months only after the opening of the railway, be in a position to take the offensive and absolutely prevent them from ever setting foot in the Congo State.""\n\n""That indeed would be worth working for,"" I remarked.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1886#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
