195,"Colonial rule in Africa imposed foreign political systems that undermined traditional governance and cultural practices, leading to political disenfranchisement, social disruption, and long-term instability.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide substantial support for the claim that colonial rule in Africa imposed foreign political systems that undermined traditional governance and cultural practices, leading to political disenfranchisement, social disruption, and long-term instability. The textbook highlights how colonial powers weakened indigenous systems by deposing traditional rulers, manipulating chieftaincy, and imposing European bureaucratic structures, resulting in a loss of prestige and authority for traditional leaders and inciting revolts against them. The imposition of European-planned taxes and the spread of Christianity further eroded traditional political and spiritual authority, while the creation of fixed colonial boundaries disrupted pre-existing political and economic zones, severing traditional ties and markets. Social impacts included racial discrimination, class divisions, and the deterioration of women's status, contributing to social disruption. The neglect of technical education in favor of liberal training created disparities and tensions between ethnic groups. Similarly, The African Times articles describe how individuals like Quacoe Andor, with no traditional claim to leadership, were appointed to positions of power due to their services to colonial governments, disrupting traditional succession and governance structures. The introduction of the gin traffic, previously prohibited under Mohammedan rule, and the demoralizing effects of British rule in Sierra Leone, where unchecked drink traffic led to social degradation, further illustrate the negative impact of European influence. The consolidation of West African settlements under a general government resulted in dissatisfaction and loss of local administrative power, while reports of lawless floggings, tortures, and the renewal of the slave trade under British rule underscore the social disruption and instability caused by colonial governance.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.744, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place. However, policy ran a long gamut, from reluctant acceptance and forced adaptation of such structures as in Portuguese Angola and German East Africa, to considered efforts at institutional preservation as in British Northern Nigeria or French Morocco. Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

In reality it was a different form of response to the struggles against colonial conquest and occupation, and it belongs to a different chapter in African history. For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity. This mentality is evident from the Ghanaian saying that Oburoni ade see a, egu po mu, or, aban wotwuu no adze wonnsua no meaning that if the white man's property gets damaged, it should simply be dumped into the sea, or government should be dragged on the ground rather than carried aloft. Both sayings imply that nobody should be concerned with what happens to government property. This mentality was the direct product of the remote and esoteric nature of the colonial administration and the elimination of an overwhelming majority of Africans, both educated and uneducated, from the decision-making process. It is important to note that this mentality is still with most Africans even after decades of independence and is part of the explanation for the reckless way in which government property is handled in many independent African countries."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In practical life the ascendancy of this racist theory led to a policy of denying Africans, no matter how well educated, equal rights and oppor› tunities with the whites in the colonial service. In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind.

The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior.

One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""The first positive political impact was the establishment of a greater degree of continuous peace and stability following the consolidation of colonialism in Africa than before. The nineteenth century, as seen already, was the century of the Mfecane and the activities of the Swahili-Arab and Nyamwezi traders such as Tippu Tip and Msiri in Central and Southern Africa, of the Fulani djihäds and the rise of the Tukulor and Mandingo empires in the Western Sudan, of the disintegration of the Oyo and Asante empires in West Africa; and all this caused a great deal of instability and in› security. But, then, conditions in Europe during the same period were not so very different either. This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security. Such conditions were definite assets since they greatly facilitated normal economic activities and social and physical mobility in each colony, which greatly accelerated the pace of modernization through the diffusion of new ideas, new techniques, new tastes and new fashions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'When the American slave systems disintegrated during the nineteenth century, the basic institutional forms and social attitudes of the societies had already been established. In general American societies were hostile to Africans and African culture.\nNevertheless, the impact of Africa was inescapable in many aspects of American society: phenotype, language, music, religion, cuisine, art, agriculture and architecture. In some cases, the influences from Africa were strong enough and pervasive enough to forge a genuine Afro-American culture competing with, and sometimes complementing the Europeanderived culture.\nIn the USA the political-structure imposed a rigid dichotomy between black and white in the population, relegating any individual with any degree of African ancestry to the category of black.$^{51}$ By contrast, throughout the rest of the hemisphere a three-tiered social categorization prevailed, corres› ponding to the dominant groups of black, mixed, and white. The relatively small number of white persons at the top of the social pyramid in most societies afforded the dominant African majorities the opportunity to impose their values and their cultures on the rest of the society.\nWithin the three-tiered structure each caste had its own set of legal rights and social privileges based on a combination of wealth, colour and occupation. In the sugar and plantation-based economic zones of Brazil, the Caribbean, and the lowlands of Mexico, Colombia and Peru, the rights of slaves as well as free persons of colour tended to be circumscribed in direct proportion to the overall demands of their labour. In the coffee, cattle and fishing areas of south-eastern Brazil, Puerto Rico, eastern Cuba, and the interior provinces of Venezuela and Argentina, social mobility tended to be greater, social distances shorter, and internal class and caste distinctions more relaxed and less formal than in the plantation zones.

PETERSBURG, March 13.**—To-day, about one o'clock, while the Emperor, accompanied by his brother, the Grand Duke Michael, was being driven in a closed carriage from the Winter Palace, a terrible and fatal attack on the Imperial equipage was made with explosive bombs. His Imperial Majesty had got as far as Catherine Canal, near the Stable Bridge, and close to the wall of the garden attached to the Michael Palace, when an explosion took place behind the carriage, wounding two horses, one of the six Cossacks forming the escort, and killing a Moujick standing near. The carriage was immediately brought to a standstill, and the Emperor, apparently thus far uninjured, stepped out before his brother in the road. Colonel Dvorketsky, who, as usual, was following behind in a sledge, at once dashed by, and seized the assassin, who drew a revolver. This was struck out of his hand. At this moment a second bomb was thrown between the Colonel and the Emperor, and both fell to the ground. Although severely injured in the arms, legs, and back, the Colonel rose and rushed to the rescue of the Emperor. The Imperial carriage being smashed to pieces by this second explosion, the wounded Colonel took the Emperor into his sledge, and drove him to the Winter Palace. Drs. Botkin, Golovin, and two others were at once summoned, and they stated in a bulletin published about three o'clock that both His Majesty's legs were broken below the knees, the lower part of the body was severely injured, and the left eye forced from its socket. They, therefore, added that there was no hope. The Grand Duke Michael, fortunately, was not hurt. One man who threw the bomb was captured on the spot; the other, it is said, is also in the hands of the police. One or two other persons are believed to have been injured. The force of the two explosions broke numerous windows at the other side of the Canal, and the reports were heard at a considerable distance from the spot. The physicians having declared the Emperor's condition hopeless, the whole Imperial family immediately gathered at the Winter Palace. The Emperor's Chaplain was soon called, and from his hands His Imperial Majesty took the last Communion and quietly expired shortly afterwards, at about a quarter to four. The Imperial Standard over the Palace was then lowered half-mast before a vast, silent, and anxiously inquiring crowd. All hats were removed, and general sorrow seemed to prevail. While driving up to the Palace the Grand Duke Cesarevitch was cheered by the masses.""}, {'id': 5322, 'article_title': 'GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MONTH', 'full_section_title': 'GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MONTH', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1886#article-0', 'issue_date': '01_03_1886', 'content': ""Mr. Gladstone completed the new Administration early in the month. A full list of the members of the Government will be found in another column.\n\nLondon has undergone a new experience, and by no means a pleasant one. In view of the very great depression of trade, and the consequent distress among the working classes, a large number of the unemployed held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square, on Monday, the 8th, asking that public works should be started for their benefit, and that Parliament should do something to facilitate the employment of British capital. While this meeting was in progress, a large number of Social Democrats assembled near and formed a procession, apparently for the purpose of going to Hyde Park. As they went along Pall Mall and St. James's Street they demolished the windows of the Carlton and other clubs, and wrecked a watchmaker's shop. Passing into Piccadilly, they entered other shops and looted and destroyed a large amount of property. When the mob got to Hyde Park they attacked both foot passengers and public and private vehicles. At the Reformers' Tree a meeting was held, at which, indeed, violence was deprecated, but the mob soon broke loose again, and rushed out of the Park, and proceeding down South Audley Street and other thoroughfares, attacked many business places and private houses, doing a vast amount of damage. It was fully two hours before the police were able to disperse the mob, but even these isolated gangs worked much further mischief. The panic among the law-abiding folk was very great, and the inaction of the police caused much dissatisfaction. The dread of renewed violence was very great on the two succeeding days; indeed, on the Wednesday, the police, acting on instructions from headquarters, went about advising the shopkeepers to close their shops, as it was anticipated that further rioting was planned. In the end, however, there was no serious renewal of violence—in London, at least.\n\nIn other parts of the country, too, there has been much rioting; in Leicester, especially, the mob, inflamed partly by trade disputes, rose and overpowered the police authorities, and proceeded to commit many acts of violence and destruction, levelled especially against obnoxious manufacturers. It was many hours before the authorities were able to restore order.\n\nThe leaders of the Socialists in London have been summoned for inciting to violence. The case is still pending.

Henderson, the Earl of Limerick, and Mr. Guy Dawnay, M.P.\n\nHer Majesty the Queen has sent a donation of £500 to the fund which the Lord Mayor of London has started in order to relieve the great distress among the unemployed of the metropolis—distress which has been aggravated by one of the severest and longest winters within living memory.

We present him with the Bible in the left hand, but with our strong right arm we thrust the bottle down his throat. I found our English Freetown a filthy, forlorn, and uncared-for Darkest England in Darkest Africa—the lost tenth of Africa got together under barbaric English misrule. I pointed out to a sanitary authority how very easy it would be to convert the place into quite a charming health resort, but he could not see it. Engineers and doctors, he informed me, never agreed on sanitary matters! Under the existing régime the filth of the town is allowed to percolate into the wells, one of the consequences being that Government has to maintain an expensive civil hospital in the town, the other the continual fear of being poisoned. I found the servant where I was staying filching the tea, and substituting for it the brown colored water of these wells which, when boiled, is the colour of strong black tea, if not quite of the taste of the 'cup that cheers.' The grass-grown streets are but half formed, the native inhabitants debauched, ragged, and wrecked by drink. They stagger out of one Government licensed grog-shop into another, until they finally tumble into one of the many holes and man-traps of the streets, there to lie and grow sober. Since falling under British rule, these unfortunate wretches have sunk to such a depth of depravity that one of their most ancient and religious rites has fallen almost altogether into disuse. With many of them there is now neither marrying nor giving in marriage, the women having become strangers to morality. Statistics of crime through the drink, out of which the Government reap so rich a revenue, are not to be had in Africa, but, to form some idea of the effects of our cowardly sin, one has only to see the daily ghastly sights in the vicinity of the police-court as the poor bedevilled creatures are being dragged, howling and cursing, to expiate their offences in her Majesty's gaol, which is an imposing structure, occupying an area just forty-three times greater than that of our neighbours, the French in St. Louis, who have a greater population than that of Freetown. ...

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Lovett Cameron, R.N., on ""Africa.""\n\nThe lecturer said that the further British influence extended in Africa the more would slavery of every kind be done away with. Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

This mentality was the direct product of the remote and esoteric nature of the colonial administration and the elimination of an overwhelming majority of Africans, both educated and uneducated, from the decision-making process. It is important to note that this mentality is still with most Africans even after decades of independence and is part of the explanation for the reckless way in which government property is handled in many independent African countries."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one. Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The African challenge to European authority', 'content': ""In South Africa the Afrikaner revolt of late 1914 against the government's decision to support the Allies was due both to pro-German sympathy and hatred of Britain. The Germans themselves did their best to provoke dis› affection among the African subjects of the Allies, being particularly active along the north-eastern border of Nigeria and in Libya. In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures. Rather they were directed against obnoxious features of colonial rule such as taxation, which was introduced into Yorubaland for the first time in 1916 and together with the increased powers given to traditional rulers under the policy of 'indirect rule', provoked the Iseyin riots.$^{44}$ In French West Africa the impositions of the indigØnat (a discriminatory judicial code), the reorganization of administra› tive boundaries, the suppression of chiefs or the exactions of chiefs without traditional authority were all major causes of the revolts that broke out in every colony of the federation.\nThese revolts were, whatever their cause, put down ruthlessly by the colonial authorities. 'Rebels' were impressed into the army, flogged or even hanged, chiefs exiled or imprisoned, and villages razed to the ground to serve as a warning. But not all protests were violent in character. Many people tried to avoid the source of their grievances by emigration or other forms of evasive action. Thus large numbers of French subjects in Senegal, Guinea, Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Ivory Coast undertook what A. I. Asiwaju has termed 'protest migrations' to the neighbouring British territories.$^{45}$ To avoid recruitment teams, inhabitants of whole villages fled to the bush. Young men mutilated themselves rather than serve in the colonial army.

I will give you an instance of two: About a month ago, a man called Joseph Cole was arrested by a policeman for assaulting him, and for using abusive language towards his corporal whilst in the lawful execution of their duty. The man was brought up in Court on these charges; the policeman so assaulted appeared as the prosecutor. The prisoner pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor was asked to call for his witnesses, who were to be ordered out of Court; but, on the prosecutor naming his witnesses, and Mr. Remecker, the Commissioner, seeing all of them to be policemen, he, Mr. Remecker, to the astonishment of all present, without entering into the merits of the case, dismissed it at once, simply because all the witnesses were policemen. Another case was that of one Moosah, who was given in charge of a constable by a woman, charging him (Moosah) with breaking into her store and stealing some goods by night, between seven and eight o'clock; and although the charge was clearly proved against him by the prosecutrix and one witness, he was discharged by Mr. Remecker, who declared the charge not proved. On being asked what was to be done with the stolen goods, which were then in Court, the man Moosah was allowed to take them away, which greatly surprised everyone in Court. The owner of the stolen goods, not being satisfied with the decision, immediately after entered a civil action against Moosah, to show cause why he should not give up the goods which were illegally in his possession, or pay the value of them; and, when the case came before the Court, Mr. Remecker had to reverse his former decision by giving judgment in favour of the plaintiff, with costs. There are several other cases, which would take too much time and space to give an account of the unwise way in which they were disposed of by Mr. Remecker; and things have been allowed to go on in this way, so that people are afraid to bring their cases into the Commissioner's Court. Mr. Remecker, in fact, knows nothing of Court affairs, as he has to consult his Clerk every now and then on trifling matters; and we find he cannot sit without his assistance. Therefore, as it seems to us poor ignorant people, the sooner he is removed from his Judicial office the better. I do not even understand why such a man should have been appointed by the Secretary of State as Auditor for this place; for I believe if he had been subjected to good and proper examination as to his qualifications and fitness before being sent out, he would never have been sent out at all. Appoint a person of legal training to the post of District Commissioner, with a salary of 600l. or 700l. a-year. If you cannot get a European, get a West Indian, some of whom seem to be more clever than many of the whites. I do not understand what the Secretary of State means by saying that good salaries will be paid to officers serving on this coast, so as to encourage and attract good men for the place. This policy, I find, with one or two exceptions, has not been carried out; for, instead of a superior class of people, we have a very inferior class, save, as I said before, one or two. We have a doctor who does not inspire any confidence; and all, however incompetent, are well paid, whilst the reverse is the case with the Africans, whom the white men have made as their tools, to earn them money. Oh, it is a pity to behold these things. Let every appointment be subject to competitive examination, and you will find complaints decrease. I hear that men and women are leading a very disgraceful life at Christiansberg, getting beastly drunk at night, dressing themselves after the fashion of the natives, and then parading the town after women and girls. Then, again, Mr. Woodcock, the Queen's Advocate, who seemed to have been providentially sent out to purify this place, is sent off to Lagos, to take up the duties of Judge Marshall, who is absent on leave. When Mr. Woodcock was thus appointed to Lagos, he had some private and other important cases on hand; and when his time of departure came, he had to leave his poor clients in the lurch, much to their damage and loss. Through his ability and judgment some smugglers were convicted in the Commissioner's Court, and the grievances of some poor people redressed. Why not appoint an Assistant Judge or a Solicitor in addition to the Chief Justice or Queen's Advocate here, who might take the place of any of the Puisne Judges in the Eastern or Western Provinces when going away on leave of absence, instead of leaving the country at the mercy of its old enemies (native pleaders), who seem to rejoice at the removal of the Queen's Advocate to Lagos, because they found they were not a match for him? We hope he will soon be back among us. Things have been in a more irregular and confused state since the removal of the headquarters here than they were before. Merchants have had great difficulties to contend with when they have any canoemen or labourers to ship for the Bights. The signing of the agreements and passports by the District Commissioner will cost them loss of valuable time and even money. Why? Because the District Commissioner lives at Christiansberg, and, unless it be Court day, which he appoints at his own convenience, you can never get him to sign them, though the men might have been ready to go by the steamer. Accra is a large town, and, as such, has been for a long time, and, until lately, the residence of Civil Commandants or District Commissioners. Why, then, should the Governor and the District Commissioner both reside there—a place three or four miles from Accra? The *District Commissioner* ought to reside at *Accra*.""}, {'id': 4274, 'article_title': 'West Coast Government', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast Government', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1881#article-14', 'issue_date': '01_08_1881', 'content': 'portance, the presence of a continually increasing number of African girls educated in some of the best schools in England.

I used to go to Lagos (where I belong to) sometimes for change on account of health, and returned to the said mentioned Jaja, and since then from the war of 1869, which brought us all to this river (Opobo), when only two Europeans entered this river, Mr. Sterling, agent for Charles Horsfall and Son, came in the river and traded with Jaja and his chiefs. At first, Consul Livingstone refused to protect them, but by much complaining to the Foreign-office in London, he was obliged to protect them. All their letters regarding the same were written by me, although I am an African born; I am obliged to act on the part of Jaja; and since the war was finished in January, 1873, trading has been going on very briskly. I, myself, am only trying with what little wages I got from Jaja during the time I was working for him. I asked permission of King Jaja to try to trade a little in the only way I then could—i.e., by bringing country clothes from Lagos to Opobo to be bartered for palm oil. The King agreed to this in consideration of the long time I was with him. I tried my best to pick up some few casks of palm oil with the country cloths, and against the time of my shipping oil, I took the oil on board the steamship Forcados, British and African Steam Navigation Company, to ship this oil to Liverpool. The captain refused to receive the oil, stating that the chairman in this river refused to allow him to receive any oil from us in the town, even from the natives. Since then, I have never been allowed to ship my oil to Liverpool. I did not know what to do; I had written to the agents of the Company, but received no reply. I cannot write to the Consul anything respecting it, as I believe the Consul is all for the Europeans in this river, because the Consul once asked King Jaja why he did not send away every Sierra Leone and Lagos man from his town. The King answered him, how can he drive human beings like himself from his country, since they had done nothing wrong? To this the Consul had nothing to say, only stating that he will not protect us as British subjects. Is this right on the part of Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, to insist on an African king turning out an African born man from his country? Dear Mr. Editor, I will only for the present ask you to notice these great evils in your paper, and try your very best to enable us to ship our palm oil from this river from time to time.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

He would have the European Powers leave the Dark Continent alone, and allow its people to work out their own redemption by the aid of religion and education. He contends—what, by the way, has never been satisfactorily proved—that the European colonization of Africa is impossible by reason of the deadly climate inland. His remarks upon the malarious climate of the Congo are directly contradicted by the evidence of Mr. Stanley and the medical officers of the Free State; but the report of the United States agent on the Congo, that of 600 whites who had contracted to serve the Government for three years only five were able to stay out their term, is very startling and ought to be contradicted if it be untrue. But, assuming that the climate were endurable by Europeans, Dr. Blyden contends that ""they could not make their acquisition of any value without introducing a system of enforced labour, which is slavery."" We are not aware that any such system has yet been introduced within the territory of the Congo State; and the necessity for enforced labour would surely have made itself felt there, if at all. Obviously it would be impossible to develop the resources of Africa by the unaided efforts of the natives; and Dr. Blyden would therefore set to work to colonize this vast and mysterious continent by civilized Christian negroes from the United States. Assuming the practicability of this scheme, it is obvious that it would settle, not only the problem of the future of Africa, but the more pressing ""negro question"" in America. Dr. Blyden believes that the negro cannot, in the nature of things, ever attain complete emancipation in America; since, apart from prejudice, which no doubt counts for something in the matter, blacks residing in a white community have furnished only too much reason for the belief that they are an inferior race. Surrounded and governed by men in whom the instinct of rule has been developed by centuries of domination, they are servile and imitative, and are kept in a position of inferiority by the fact that all their ideals of perfection are white ideals, to which they can never attain. Christianity found the negro a slave, and has left him, in mind if not in person, very much as she found him. His servility and imitativeness have been accentuated by the tone of all literature, in which he is, as it was once put, ""either a weakling or a caricature.""

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

The articles also discuss his broader contributions, such as establishing a bank and writing on political economy and medical aspects of diseases in Africa, indicating his impact beyond medical practice. They further address the challenges faced by African medical professionals, including systemic biases and the preference for European medical officers, which align with the claim of underrecognition.

Indeed, it was the Creoles, as the educated people of Sierra Leone came to be called, who pioneered most of the missionary and educational activities in the other parts of West Africa. Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W. Johnson, R. B. Blaize and J. A. Otunba Payne.30 The Gold Coast elite of the 1870s and 1880s included J. A. Solomon, E.J. Fynn, J. P. Brown, J. de Graft Hayford, A. W. Parker, T. Laing, J. H.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

In these works he also advocated 'Africa for the Africans', pan-Africanism, the African personality, Islam and polygamy which were to him more in keeping with African personality, insisted on the purity and integrity of the black race and therefore condemned mixed marriages, championed Ethiopianism and, above all, preached racial pride. In an article published in 1874, he praised the Mande and Fulbe peoples, who were Muslims and were developing the idea of a national and social order without the aid or hindrance of foreigners.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

This neither they nor we can easily discard.'$^{4}$ It is interesting to note that another English historian, D. K. Fieldhouse, has arrived at the same con› clusion in a book published as recently as 1981: 'It would thus appear that colonialism deserves neither the praise nor the blame it has often been given for, if it did relatively little to overcome the causes of poverty in the colonies, neither did it make them poor for the first time.

We accordingly interpret European im› perialism in Africa as an engine of cultural transformation as well as of political domination.' 7 Others, mainly African, black and Marxist scholars and especially the development and underdevelopment theorists, have contended that the beneficial effect of colonialism in Africa was virtually nil. The black Guyanese historian, Walter Rodney, has taken a particularly extreme position. As he contends: 'The argument suggests that, on the one hand, there was exploitation and oppression, but, on the other hand, colonial governments did much for the benefit of Africans and they developed Africa. It is our contention that this is completely false. Colonialism had only one hand - it was a one-armed bandit.' 8 Such are the two main opposing assessments of colonialism in Africa. From the available evidence, however, it would appear that a much more balanced assessment is necessary and this is what is attempted here.

Upon taking a baccalaureate and a divinity degree, however, Aggrey accepted employment in the AME Zion publishing house in Charlotte, became correspondent for one or two black newspapers, conducted free classes for black teachers in the vicinity, was ordained a Church elder, and was offered a pastorate by two black churches. According to his biographer, this pastoral work was 'one of the most important incidents in Aggrey's American experiences', because 'it took him out of an academic atmosphere and introduced him to the activities of the life led by the American Negro'.$^{41}$ Moreover, his connections with black America had already been deepened when he married, in 1904, a young Afro-American woman, possibly a descendant of Frederick Douglass.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa.

With indescribable pain we learned that only two or three days later she was again prostrated with fever and dysentery. This second attack was much stronger than the first, and coming upon a system still further enfeebled by the previous one, her life was in great danger. But God was pleased to bless the extraordinary exertion of Dr. Africanus J. Horton, S.A.S., who not only treated her malady with the highest medical skill, but watched and tended her day and night every hour that he could be spared from his other patients, until she became happily so far recovered that he was able to get her on board the mail steamer for England. To England he intended she should go, considering a residence in a cooler climate to be indispensable to her complete restoration. Before Mrs. Mosely left Cape Coast, Mr. Usher, the Administrator, had assigned 200l. a-year as the Government local subsidy to the school, and Miss Grant, daughter of Mr. F. C. Grant, J.P., of Cape Coast, who had been educated in England, undertook the supervision of the school during Mrs. Moseley's enforced absence. Mrs. Mosely had, therefore, the great relief of knowing that her work was taken care of while she should be seeking health. When the steamer reached Sierra Leone Mrs. Moseley, however, was taken on shore, and received and treated by Sir Arthur Kennedy, C.B., Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, with a hearty and considerate kindness which does him the highest honour. Sir Arthur's anxious desires and earnest advice, as communicated to us by his Excellency by letter, was that Mrs. Mosely, after adequate rest at Government House, should fulfil Dr. Horton's intentions and come on to England. And this was our earnest desire also. But her heart is so set on that great work she has undertaken, that, feeling her strength rapidly increasing, she has, in opposition to Dr. Horton's command, and Sir Arthur's and our desire, elected to return at once to Cape Coast, and we believe will, ere this, have again arrived there. As the rainy reason will have entirely passed, all that is left to us is to hope that she may now find the climate as beneficent as it was previously fatal to her health. Sir Arthur Kennedy has confirmed Mr. Usher's action as regards the grant of 200l. per annum to the school, and if it should please God so to strengthen Mrs. Moseley that she may be able to remain throughout the dry season at Cape Coast, we have every hope that the school will take such deep root as to ensure its future growth and usefulness. The names of Dr. Horton, Sir Arthur Kennedy, and Mr. Usher will now be indelibly associated with that effort to impart instruction to the rising female population of Cape Coast, and to bring them under the influence of those Christian precepts and civilised habits that will fit them to be mothers of Christian civilised families, upon the increase of which the prosperity and happiness of the Gold Coast must very much depend. It is happily impossible for barbarism to be restored to its ancient power, and it therefore becomes more and more necessary to have an educated native population that will co-operate earnestly with the British Administration in the work of public improvement, which we hope will now be pushed forward with prudence and vigour. We beg, in conclusion, to tender our most sincere and heartfelt thanks to Dr. Horton for his devoted attention, to Sir Arthur Kennedy, Mr. Administrator Ussher, and Mr. Rainy, for all they have done for our dear friend's safety and comfort.

Our late beloved friend, whose memory we shall always love and revere, has been gathered by the Angel of Death into that ""rest which remaineth to the people of God."" Can it be necessary to remind any of our readers that this Mrs. Moseley was the lady who left this country and her loving friends, by the steamer Congo, on the 6th April last, for Cape Coast, on a mission of love and mercy, to found and establish a female industrial Christian school at Cape Coast? We think all will remember how we then wrote of her devotion of years of life in preparation of this work. She loved the people of Cape Coast; and she has laid down her life for those she so much loved, and for whose earthly happiness and eternal welfare she was so actively anxious. Humanly speaking, it was her devotion to the work which she believed God had appointed her to do that has led her to a premature death, if the death of a true child and servant of God in Christ Jesus can be in any instance deemed premature. Narrowly escaping death by the fatal Coast fever in July last, she was conveyed, with some difficulty, by her kind and zealous medical attendant, Dr. Horton, on board a homeward-bound steamer under orders to proceed at once to England. On arriving at Sierra Leone the genial hospitality of Sir Arthur Kennedy awaited her. She was taken to Government House, to wait the next homeward steamer. Here she slowly recovered strength; and instead of coming on to England, she resisted all entreaties to do so, and returned to Cape Coast. There she established her school at Palm House. How she won all hearts there we must tell in another notice. She had again an attack of fever, again recovered, and was pursuing her work for Christ with unremitting ardour when fever came for the third time, and this time, alas! carried off its victim. Her body has been laid beside that of her husband in the burial-ground of Cape Coast; her happy spirit has gone into closer communion with that dear and precious Saviour who had been indeed the joy of her life.\n\nThe details of her fatal illness, death, and burial, hurriedly sent off, reached us only on the 18th inst., and are very imperfect; but we feel we ought to give the letter of Dr. Horton, her devoted medical friend, an African, to whom and to Sir Arthur Kennedy we are indebted for the intelligence of our and Cape Coast\'s great loss.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SURGEONS FOR THE GOLD COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Army Medical Department has been advertising in the daily papers for assistant surgeons to serve on the West Coast of Africa—at Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and the Gold Coast.\n\nWe feel that this advertisement for assistant surgeons calls for especial notice from us.

Quaker, and Prince Horton, and their compeers of active, pushing, and aspiring talent and genius. The interest he recently manifested in the welfare of the Church Native Pastorate, his recent election on the Church Council, and the position he held as Treasurer of the Institute, and the warm interest he displayed in going about to collect for the Church Endowment Fund, are indications that he was not wholly engaged in the things of time and sense, but that whilst ""not slothful in business, he was diligent in spirit, serving the Lord.""\n\nDr. Horton was one of the only two Africans that have the privilege of holding Her Majesty\'s commission to serve on the Army Medical Staff, and by their exemplary conduct and capacity for the position they hold, have demonstrated the capacity of the Negro to hold any important position. After a successful career of twenty-four years in the Army, he retired on a well-earned pension, with the rank of Surgeon-Major. His recent efforts to establish a Bank at Sierra Leone, though of yesterday, and yet in its infancy, had begun to make steady progress and to become appreciated, though the establishment is scarcely a year old.\n\nDr. Horton\'s work on ""Political Economy for Western Africa"" and his other work on the medical aspect of diseases peculiar to the African climate, are matters of history, and require no brushing up at our hands. Viewed from many standpoints, his death is an irreparable loss, and more so to his widow and two daughters, and a large circle of friends and acquaintances.

No man has more successfully vindicated the just claim of the African race to mental equality with the more favoured portions of mankind. The son of liberated Africans—that is, of Africans who had been rescued from on board slave-ships by cruisers of Her Majesty's Navy—he had the disadvantage of being of the first generation of his family in the ranks of civilization. He had none of the advantages possessed by Europeans of hereditary culture. What he effected was all his own—all the fruit of his own labour, utilizing the elements placed at his disposal by the Christian philanthropy of Great Britain. The Church Missionary Society may record his name with pride as among the fruit of their persistent labours in West Africa; and Her Majesty's Government had certainly no cause to regret having taken him into the medical ranks of the Army, in which he attained to the high position of Surgeon-Major, and from which he retired last year, after a full period of service, but without receiving the decoration of St. Michael and St. George, which could only have been withheld because he was an African.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs.

After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries.

No grounds that we can perceive can justify such a step in face of the facts we are about to detail, and which incontestably prove that European medical officers (and others), instead of shrinking from service in West Africa, on the contrary, prefer the West Africa stations to those of the West Indies; and not unfrequently volunteer for the Coast. Indeed, the substantial privileges they enjoy in West Africa, in the shape of every year's service being doubly reckoned, besides the advantages of private practice—a privilege from which they are debarred in the West Indies, by private practice there being in the hands of civil medical practitioners—are, we affirm, keenly appreciated by them. There is no difficulty in proving this assertion. Beginning at the Gambia, we find that the present principal medical officer has already served twice on the Gold Coast, preferring to remain at the Gambia, and getting his appointment as surgeon to one of the West India regiments cancelled. In the same way Mr. M'D., who had been stationed on the Gold Coast, and at the Gambia, had his request granted to be relieved of the surgeoncy of a West India regiment, to return to the Coast, and it is well known that the late Mr. Brien most reluctantly accepted the appointment of surgeon to the 2nd West India Regiment, stationed at Barbadoes, where he was cut off by yellow fever, after having served once at the Gambia, and twice on the Gold Coast. Again, three of the staff assistant-surgeons have been stationed, two of them once on the Gold Coast, and one twice at the Gambia. We moreover find that Mr. Robertson, the present Colonial Secretary at the Gambia, had previously been Colonial Surgeon from 1835 to 1849, and is still in the enjoyment of good health. His successor as Colonial Surgeon retired on a comfortable pension, after a service of ten years; and the gentleman at present holding that office has now held it some four or five years. The present judge at the Gambia also commenced his official career, in 1837, as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, and has lived there, with the exception of occasional visits to England, from that time until now, in the enjoyment of a fair share of health. If we turn to Sierra Leone, we find that the late Colonial Surgeon lived there from 1831 to 1854, and in that long period went only twice home. The present Colonial Surgeon, whose appointment dates from January, 1856, had previously served as Staff Assistant-Surgeon at the Gambia and Sierra Leone, and with the exception of a severe attack of fever during the prevalence of the epidemic, or yellow fever, in 1859, has enjoyed good health. His brother, at present Assistant Colonial Surgeon, has likewise been appointed some time, and we are glad to know that his salary has been increased from 200l. to 300l. per annum, and that he is not restricted as preceding assistant colonial surgeons at Sierra Leone were from private practice.

Towards this end they removed a substantial number of unco› operative 'traditional' rulers, thereby violating the religious and cultural sanctity of kingship. To reinforce their tenuous rule, they dispatched African police, drawn from the ranks of mercenaries and allies, to oversee the activities of 'colonial chiefs' and to intimidate the local population. Given their desire for self-aggrandizement and their monopoly of power, it is hardly surprising that members of the Force Publique of the Congo, the 'Guerras PrŒtas' of Angola, the SepÆis of Mozambique, and the British Native Police of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland engaged in predatory activities and repeatedly abused their authority.\nTo provide a pool of cheap labour for government projects and Euro› pean capitalist interests, the colonial powers resorted to forced labour practices coupled with repressive taxation. In the Congo, Africans were compelled to collect rubber and to work on the railways and in the mines, while in Mozambique a variety of multi-national concessionary companies were the principal beneficiaries of the forced labour. Other Mozambicans were exported to Southern Rhodesia, South Africa and Sao TomØ. In Sao TomØ, on the cocoa plantations, they were joined by thousands of Angolans.

The impôt de cueillette, the tax by which wild rubber was harvested in the Congo Free State, was the most criticized of such taxes, but in duration the French prestation, a labour tax required of all males in French West and Equatorial Africa unless remitted by cash payment, was the longest; it was only abolished in 1944. Conversely, the Germans in the Cameroon allowed the capitation tax to be remitted by a labour 'payment'. And in parts of Uganda, the British continued the luwalo, a pre-colonial public-work tax of one month's labour, until 1938, when it was replaced by a money tax. Yet such taxes were the exception to forced labour devices employed by all of the colonial powers.\nConsistently concerned with shortages of manpower for new projects and new employments which colonial rule supported, European administrators imposed their domination before the end of the century by a system of virtual impressment, frequently satisfying private as well as public purposes. It is true that such direct forced labour declined in the early twentieth century, because of the decreasing need for portage as well as the increasing concern with international opinion. But the uses, however modified, remained an integral part of colonial domination until the Second World War. At least this was the case with the French colonial governments which, as in West Africa still employed large numbers of Africans through prestation particularly on railway building until after the Second World War. Moreover, French colonial officials frequently sanctioned labour recruitment for commercial purposes, as on rubber plantations of Equatorial Africa or in the forests of the Ivory Coast.$^{28}$ Abuses at this time were still sufficient in intensity to arouse expressions of public indignation, most well marked in the celebrated commentary of AndrØ Gide in his Voyage au Congo (1927)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Africano (The African Voice), pursued a similar objective as the self-defined guardian of African peasants and workers.

At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""In direct contrast to this method was the French which tended to erode African authority, finally making the administrator the responsible judicial official.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices.

In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

The evidence we now print is, to our mind, conclusive on this point. We were slow to believe it. When we first heard of the death of Joseph Gordon, and the verdict of the coroner\'s jury, we thought there must be some mistake. We were not disposed to imagine that an unfortunate petty criminal—a man sentenced to a few months\' imprisonment with hard labour—could have so aroused the evil passions of authorities or gaolers as to induce them to inflict on him an unwonted and fatal degree of punishment. And in this we were right, although wrong in our doubt as to the man having been murdered. Gordon was not in any way exceptionally treated. He was only one of many, all of whom were subject to the same system—a system so barbarous and atrocious that a better could scarcely have been devised if the killing off a percentage of the gaol population had been a deliberately contemplated result. Look at the evidence! The coroner\'s jury had returned a verdict that the man was killed by shot-drill and treadmill punishment. The Administrator of the colony, it appears, appoints and regulates the criminal employment. This was supposed to be appointed and regulated by Ordinance, the colony having a sort of legislative council. Admiral Patey, however, seems to have acted without Ordinance as regards shot-drill. He therefore rightly viewed the finding of the jury as involving something of a criminal charge against himself. He is consequently dissatisfied with it. He knows the power of quasi-omnipotent and irresponsible West African governors to elicit from subordinate officials and others in those colonies just such opinions as they themselves desire to have expressed, when the said governors refer matters to them. He therefore ordered Gordon\'s body to be exhumed and a post-mortem examination to be made. The surgeon found the right lung, liver, and spleen to be most extensively diseased, but believed the immediate cause of death to be inflammation of the lungs (vide No. 2). If the Administrator had possessed a particle of wisdom he would have stopped here. But the verdict of the jury had condemned his favourite shot-drill and treadmill exercise, and he would not stop there. He demands Dr. Waters\', the examining surgeon\'s, opinion as to whether the death was caused by those punishments, &c. It will be seen presently that in presenting the circumstances, he grossly misstated them in his own favour. Dr. Waters replies (No. 9) that ""in his opinion such hard labour would not directly produce inflammation of the lungs."" The Administrator refers to Dr. Burrows, the Chief Military Medical Officer, who makes a similar reply. The Chief Magistrate is then ""requested to give his opinion as to the legal effect of the verdict, and whether it was not the duty of the Coroner to direct the jury to find a specific verdict against some person,"" &c. (No. 7). Mr. Chalmers, the Magistrate, says (No. 8) that ""it is impossible to extract from the evidence such a verdict, no witness having stated the circumstances or the authority under which Gordon was subjected to the treadmill and shot-drill; an omission,"" he adds, ""the more remarkable that there is, apparently, an inconsistency in the infliction of these punishments upon a man selected for the responsible duty of hospital attendant."" This must have been ""touching the raw;"" but the Administrator is determined to go on tightening the rope, figuratively speaking, about his own neck. An additional inquiry is ordered. There is no power to take this evidence on oath, so it is taken on declaration, under the Act 5 and 6 William IV. To realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. There are rules and regulations by Ordinance, but the Governor gives verbal orders to go beyond them, and the gaoler obeys. Hard labour was previously understood to be ""that the prisoners worked in gangs, in chains, in public or other works."" The present Administrator made an addition to this. He ordered that in addition they should have half an hour shot-drill in the morning, and half an hour treadmill in the evening. (Admiral Patey had stated it as ten minutes each to Dr. Waters.) While the Admiral was absent in England four months, the gaoler had discontinued these punishments; but when he heard he was coming back he falsified his journal to conceal his humanity. Admiral Patey calls him to account for it. He replied that he omitted them because the men have such heavy work on the sea-wall and drains. He then receives orders to resume the shot-drill and treadmill, and this is the routine: The men rise at half-past five, begin work at six (without food); are brought back to gaol at half-past nine, shot-drill till ten, then breakfast (their first food for the day), which consists of one pound of rice, boiled plain, with salt; then to work again till half-past four, treadmill till five, then dinner (their only other meal), consisting of half a pound of bread and half a pound of beef, including bone; then locked into cells at six. Thus, when placed on shot-drill, the men have been sixteen and a half hours without food, and on work three and a half hours of that time. No wonder that ""prisoners complain of their chests"" after their 24-pounder shot-drill; no wonder ""they fall down sweating"" at the treadmill. We repeat that to realise the full gravity of this evidence it must be read throughout. We are not squeamish about making prisoners work, but this evidence causes us an indescribable feeling of disgust and horror. We have given an account of the diet of these hard-labour prisoners to whose tasks daily shot-drill and treadmill were added by Admiral Patey—imposed by verbal order, without their having been prescribed by any Ordinance, ordered to be performed at hours when the men were exhausted by labour and long fasting. But that which constitutes the gravamen of the charge against Admiral Patey, is that he imposed and ordered, and inexorably exacted, these additional and trying labours without any previous medical examination of the men to know whether they were able to perform them without danger to their lives. Can anything be more atrocious than this? Are the lives of men, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment because they cannot pay a fine imposed (see the Gordon evidence) to be thus trifled with by some insane Administrator?—for the most charitable presumption is that such a man must be insane. The medical evidence asserts that ""three-fourths of the natives who come under medical examination are ruptured"" (see No. 17); and yet this probably ruptured man, sentenced to seven days\' imprisonment as an alternative of a fine, is put on the treadmill and shot-drill! To be sure these men are only Africans, and the Administrator is an Englishman and a Rear-Admiral; yet, though they are so mean and he so exalted, we should scarcely have ventured to think that when the gaoler told him ""the shot-drill was too severe for the men, and that sometimes they fell off,"" he could have had the criminal inhumanity to reply, ""If any man falls off, you must keep him his time at it.""

Adjoining and in front of this yard is an open space formerly used by the late Mr. Hutton as a small flower-garden, with a small building (a summer-house) at one end, some thirty feet long by twenty feet wide. *This is the colonial hospital, and inside the gaol!* And neither you nor anybody else will feel inclined to believe it, but such I assure you is sober fact, there is no other colonial hospital for a colony that pays 25,000l. to 30,000l. per annum, in taxes, customs, and excise dues, into the colonial exchequer; and for people residing in town there is no access to this so-called hospital except through the common gaol-yard. Sailors, seamen, and mariners, and any other strangers that are sometimes obliged to be sent to the hospital, have to go to prison alike, criminal or not. In this hospital, thirty feet by twenty feet outside measurement, or thereabouts, are usually six or seven beds for patients, all occupied now; but during the time (three years) that the notorious Mr. Thomas Jones was colonial surgeon not half a dozen persons ever visited the hospital. Tom Jones used to punch their heads and kick them out. *He* had no time to attend to the niggers, and sometimes for days he never went near the hospital at all. He, however, visited the surgery *nearly* every day, and the average time of his attendance was about fifteen minutes, and for this he received between 300l. and 400l. a-year. At the other end of this open space, or former flower-garden, and in this twenty yards of the hospital, is a small brick building about eight feet long by three or four feet wide; this is the water-closet, kept rigorously locked, of course. At the back or side of this small building, however, and within sight of the hospital (the hospital is only on the ground floor, level with the flower-garden) is placed on the ground a long box or trough, broader at top than at bottom, about six feet long and twelve inches high, more resembling a coffin, indeed, painted black and all (the invention, I understand, of the clever and astute Mr. Thomas Jones). There is no cover to this arrangement, and the prisoners have to balance themselves as they best can against the edge of this box, trough, or coffin, to relieve the calls of nature.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental.

There are numerous inaccuracies in the official reports. Assessor Wehlau, the leader of the expedition, while the villages were burning, gave orders that some old women should have their throats cut; as for men, he could not take prisoners.

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters.

The coroner's inquest, which took place in July last, reveals a state of things more worthy of the most barbarous ages, than of the civilisation and sanitary advancement of the year 1868. The Commandant, the Chief Magistrate—every Government officer down to the jailer—should blush at the revelations. The revelations which have taken place cast completely into the shade the awful disclosures made in the days of Mrs. Fry. Five or six beings crowded into one cell, no regular ablutions practised by the prisoners sunk into the slough of despair, solitary confinement carried to an unexampled excess, and, to crown all, no infirmaries provided within the prison for the sick and mentally and bodily afflicted. This is a state of things which must not be permitted any longer to exist, and I trust the practical and philanthropic mind of his Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy, our popular Governor-in-chief, has been turned to it, and that if he deems it necessary he will institute a commission of inquiry to remedy these outrages against the laws of humanity.\nIt is quite useless for me to impress the people of Accra with the enormity of domestic slavery, when they can point out the state of our prisons, where we immure fellow-beings in a far worse than Egyptian slavery of old. There is something tragic in reading the evidence produced upon the inquest, when a native prisoner states that his fellow-sufferer, in the cell the deceased European, was dying.

We need only refer to one pamphlet, published in 1833, under the title, ""Three Months in Jamaica in 1832."" This little publication had an enormous sale, and did much to rouse the British nation to a sense of the enormities daily committed in her distant colonies. The author went out to Jamaica with the intention of residing in a business capacity on a sugar plantation. He was one of those who did not believe in the horrors of slavery, and thought that our factory children in England were worse off than any plantation slaves. He was soon undeceived. Proceeding on horseback to the estate soon after his arrival, and enjoying the exquisite tropical scenery, he came upon a gang of negroes at work, most of them females. As he rode past the driver cracked his tremendous whip, shouting out, ""Work! work!"" and from that moment the enchanting scenery and the beautiful humming-birds of Jamaica had no longer any charm for him. The first evening of his arrival at the plantation the overseer gave the command, ""Blow shell!"" A large shell was blown, and four athletic negro drivers appeared, bringing in six slaves. For some slight defect in the tally of the day\'s work these men had to be flogged. The flogging of the men is described in terms too painful to repeat; but worst of all is the account given of similar punishments inflicted upon women, some of them quite young girls. The author took pains to inquire whether this treatment was general, and he came to the conclusion that it was next to impossible to find a slave, either male or female, who had not been flogged. But this was only one and the most ordinary form of punishment; the stocks and contrivances for hanging negroes by their thumbs, wrists, etc., were only too common, whilst hundreds were killed outright. This picture is too revolting to contemplate at the present day, and to us now it appears almost incredible.\n\nIt is refreshing to record the feelings of joy and gratitude with which Mr. Buxton and his friends received the accounts of ""the admirable conduct of the negroes on the great day of freedom."" Mr. Buxton says: ""Throughout the colonies the churches and chapels had been thrown open, and the slaves had crowded into them on the evening of the 31st of July, 1834. As the hour of midnight approached they fell upon their knees, and awaited the solemn moment, all hushed in silent prayer.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working.""

A few days since a slave was seized by a number of freemen, and dragged to the beach, close to our mission; they were about tying his legs together, but when they saw me descending the hill, they hurried him into a canoe, which was taken out into the middle of the river; the poor fellow was thrown into the water, but, being a swimmer, he tried to hold the canoe, but was beaten across the head with paddles and sticks.

We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him.

The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

They were paid such low sums that some refused to take them. This African response was not against growing cotton as such, which they had willingly started growing as a cash crop.

Rarely did the peasants seek to solidify their initial gains or to shift their goals from an attack on the symbols of their oppression to an attack on the colonial system as a whole. As a rule, increased or more strictly enforced taxation and labour demands precipitated the uprisings. In the Zambezi valley between 1890 and 1905 at least sixteen different uprisings occurred. Most of these revolts were directed against the Companhia de Mozambique and the Companhia de ZambØsia to which Lisbon ceded most of central Mozambique. Both of these undercapitalized firms sought to maximize profits by imposing a heavy hut tax and exporting forced labour, policies which precipitated the uprisings.$^{53}$ During this period there were also several small-scale uprisings in Angola. Peasant revolts among the IIa, Gwemba Tonga and Western Lunda during the first decade of this century concerned British officials in Northern Rhodesia, while in the Congo conservative estimates place the number of localized rural uprisings at more than ten per year. 54 Although most of these uprisings were amorphous, kaleidoscopic and parochial, in several instances participation raised the political conscious› ness of the peasants to such a level that they subsequently joined broader- based anti-colonial movements.

The Chope, living in southern Mozambique, for example, developed an entire repertoire of songs denouncing the colonial regime in general and the hated tax official in particular: We are still angry; its always the same story The oldest daughter must pay the tax Natanele tells the white man to leave him alone Natanele tells the white man to leave me be You, the elders must discuss our affairs For the man the whites appointed is the son of a nobody The Chope have lost the right to their own land Let me tell you about it 89 The work songs of labourers employed by Sena Sugar Estates were even more explicitly hostile, often depicting the European overseers in the most unflattering sexual terms.$^{90}$ To the north the Makua and Makonde artists ridiculed state officials - both African and European - in highly stylized carvings which distorted their features and eliminated their humanity.""', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country united by its submission to France and its opposition to colonial domination > The first reactions in opposition to the colonial system', 'content': ""GalliØni explained away the insurrection by claiming that it was due to the mentality of the local people 'with their warlike disposition' and 'their attractive conception of disorder and plunder'. Victor Augagneur, his successor, saw the reasons as lying in the 'surfeit of administration' (increased taxation, abuses in tax collection, and the tyrannical attitude of heads of military posts or isolated settlers). These explanations were inadequate, since they overlooked an essential aspect of the insurrection (the struggle for the recovery of freedom) and the organizational ability of the insurgents, who attacked all those who personified the colonial administration, whether they were French occupying forces or Malagasy civil servants or schoolteachers. By way of conclusion to his study of the 1904 rebellion, G. Jacob states that it undoubtedly had a twofold significance: 'it was a fight for independence and a struggle against colonial exploitation'.$^{26}$ The suppression of this first revolt against the oppression of the administration forced the Malagasy to seek other forms of struggle.\nOne of the most widespread forms of anti-colonial response was passive resistance: a refusal to comply with orders; the rejection of everything that was regarded as a sign of 'civilization' but was closely bound up with colonization and the foreign presence; keeping children away from school, which was looked upon in some circles as merely being a form of 'colonial forced labour'; and abandonment of the villages created along the roads in the south in an attempt to keep the population together. These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905. But then, suddenly, in 1915, the revolt of the Sadiavahe the nickname given to the insurgents - broke out in the south-west, while in Antananarivo the police discovered the existence of a secret society known as Vy Vato Sakelika or VVS - 'strong and hard like stone and iron' (see Fig. 10.3)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""In accordance with the general principle that local populations should defray the costs of measures calculated to enhance their material, social and intellectual progress, a poll tax of one shilling per head was instituted in 1852 and generally accepted, though only very briefly.$^{5}$ In fact, resistance to the tax soon became very strong, not so much because the officials responsible for tax collection were supplanting the chiefs, but because only 8 per cent of the revenue was used for schools and roads, most of it being used to pay the host of civil servants on administrative duties. Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour.

Even where the employers agreed to pay increases, they often reneged upon them as in the case of the 1919 strike. Nevertheless, despite these reversals and the rise to power of a fascist government, strikes continued after 1926, though less frequently. 96 Perhaps the most bitter port confrontation was the Quinhenta strike in 1933. Port officials and handling companies, suffering the effects of the world depression, decided to reduce the already low wages of wharf workers by between 10 and 30%. This cutback represented five times the amount gained in the 1921 strike. When the announcement was made, workers walked off the job and refused to return after lunch, leaving the port paralysed. Leaders of the strike vowed that they would not return until the cuts were rescinded. Faced with a paralysed port, employers agreed to the demands and port workers returned only to find themselves locked in the port and surrounded by police who forced them to unload all the ships.

The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

The innovation of western education in the Protectorate was interpreted by religious leaders as an instrument for Christian missionary activities and consequently a threat to Islam. The attempts to foster such education in 1920 and 1935 aroused fierce resentment that culminated in two riots: at Burao in 1922 and Baro in 1936. On the latter occasion the newly-appointed British director of education was greeted with a shower of stones. 40 Equally significant were the local risings against French colonialism. Both the Afar, and the Isa Somalis, the two main ethnic groups in French Somaliland, displayed a hostile attitude towards colonial administration. The Afar Sultanates of Tadjüra and Gobaad were particularly active in this respect. The French had in fact summarily deported the Sultan of Gobaad to Madagascar in 1931. 41 The Sultan of Awsa, who had for long opposed French penetration in the area, had his own grievances during the inter-war period. French control of the region between the coast and the Ethiopian frontier deprived him of the revenues he had formerly derived from the local people and the caravan trade. Hence Sultan Yayü ambushed and arrested Lippmann, the newly appointed French governor at Dikhil. His successor, Albert Bernard, and sixteen of his Somali troops were murdered at Morheito in 1935. The activism of the Sultan of Awsa further increased after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 and Rome's backing of Awsa's territorial claims at the expense of France. 42 The arbitrary colonial partition of Somali frontiers was done without consulting the clansmen concerned and with little or no account of clan distribution or grazing needs.

Large numbers of peasants fled from Katanga and Kasai provinces to avoid the agents working for the Bourse du Travail de Katanga (BTK), the industrial labour bureau that recruited and distributed workers within Katanga. Still others escaped shortly after their arrival at the mines. As early as 1914 desertion had become such a serious problem that the BTK introduced a pass system and a finger-printing bureau to trace 'fugitives'.$^{5}$ ' Despite such coercive tactics, desertion continued to be prevalent. In 1918, for example, at the Star and Liksai copper mines, the desertion rate was 74 and 66.5% respectively. Although desertion declined somewhat in the 1920s, it continued to run at between 20 and 35% up until the Great Depression, when the lack of alternative sources of income made such a strategy counterproductive. 52 While thousands fled from the mines, others in Katanga began to organize, albeit in the most tentative and sporadic fashion, in order to improve the conditions of their employment. In 1921, a large number of miners at Luishi, for example, walked off the job and proceeded to Elizabeth ville to complain to government officials of ill-treatment and poor rations. Two years later a similar work stoppage occurred at the Kakontwe mines. 53 The Depression created new economic uncertainties. Jobs disappeared, wages dropped and working conditions deteriorated, as mining interests sought to minimize costs. Despite threats to workers that they would be dismissed, however, work stoppages and labour 'riots' erupted at the Union MiniŁre mines of Kipushi, Ruashi and Mswenu Ditu in 1931, temporarily paralysing operations.$^{54}$ In the same year workers organized a boycott in Elizabethville to protest against the high prices charged for basic com› modities by the Union MiniŁre company stores and independent European merchants.

They have been fined, punished, and ill treated, when there is no occasion for it, and they never complain. What does it matter to the King, chiefs, &c., whether Hendick Doyer or any of the other officers is placed at the head of the Government, so long as he follows the footsteps of the former governor—say, Nagglas and Mulzer, for instance? It is a positive fact that the instigators were his own brother officers! It is true the natives don’t like Hendick Doyer, but they had no intention of writing against him. The Government chest at St. George d’Elmina has three locks; the Governor, cashier, and commanding officer keep one key each in their possession.

The reported speech of Governor Rowe to the Chiefs at Lokkah, which we gave in our last, has been the overflowing drop of bitterness in the popular cup. We have already expressed that we could not wonder at the popular indignation, for which there were in that speech two strong grounds—viz., the expressions respecting the origin of the Sierra Leoneans, and the recommendation to the native Chiefs to inflict on them severe punishment for any offences they might commit up the rivers.

There was not any meeting of the Legislative Council from 1877 to April, 1878, which latter was a mere formal one, no legislative measures being brought before it, and there being two non-official vacancies in that body—a body which, so far as we can remember, was never troublesomely opposed to the Executive. The Governor, moreover, is said to have caused confusion in every department of the public service by an unfortunate belief that nothing can be well done unless by himself or under his immediate personal inspection and direction; and to be sacrificing every public interest to one sole and only object—that of being able to report to England the existence of a surplus of revenue over expenditure. He is said to have made a supreme god of the colonial treasury chest, and to yield to it exclusive devotion and worship. Public works, it is asserted, are left to take care of themselves, which they cannot well do in any country, and least of all in a tropical one where deterioration is very rapid.

This is a very unsatisfactory position for a matter of so great importance, and a position in which it is not at all proper that it should remain. Other steamships bringing mails from Sierra Leone having since arrived in England, we had hoped that Mr. Isaacs would have renewed his question, and that the explanatory denial of Governor Rowe would have been furnished, so that it might have appeared in our present number. We say explanatory denial, because a mere categorical one, however satisfactory it may be considered by Her Majesty\'s Secretary of State for the Colonies, will not satisfy, and ought not to satisfy, the memorialists, or those who feel for them in the indignity sought to be cast upon them in the words attributed to Governor Rowe. If there has been error and misapprehension, we are quite sure that the Sierra Leone memorialists will be only too happy to be assured on these points. It is quite clear that Governor Rowe did make some observations at Port Lokkoh. What were they? Let Governor Rowe\'s edition of the observations be placed before the memorialists and their friends, that these may trace, if practicable, how and where the misapprehension originated. There are cases in which a simple denial of the truth of statements is all that can be required, such as if Governor Rowe had not been at Lokkoh at all, or had not spoken at all when there. But so far as we understand, there is no denial of Governor Rowe having made an allocution at Port Lokkoh; but all that is denied is his utterance of the words attributed to him. When we look at those words it seems difficult to believe that even a most perverse and malevolent ingenuity can have altogether invented them. There must have been some foundation of truth in them. What was that foundation? It must have been a pretty strong one, we should think, for both the Port Lokkoh Chiefs and the Sierra Leone Traders to have built upon it what is denounced as an edifice of lies. It is so essential that a people should be on good terms with the authorities set to rule over them, that this matter ought to be thoroughly cleared up, if Governor Rowe is to be continued at Sierra Leone. Until it be cleared up there will be a smouldering discontent among a large class of the people, which the more wise and prudent may not be able always to restrain, as, to their great credit, they have hitherto done, within the limits of order; while any disorder would be so injurious to the interests of the colony and its people, that the continued existence of causes calculated to produce it ought to be as strongly deprecated by the supreme authorities as by the governed. We have another serious charge against Dr. Rowe, and should like to know how he can justify his compelling Government officials to work in their offices on Sundays. If his mind is unhappily in that state that he has not himself any respect for the ""day of rest,"" he ought to recollect that he represents a country, one of the greatest distinctions of which is that its laws and regulations discourage in every possible way the performance of ordinary labour on the Sunday.'}, {'id': 3686, 'article_title': 'THE GAMBIA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GAMBIA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_01_1879', 'content': 'With reference to statements which appeared in our columns with regard to Sunday work at the Gambia, we are informed that the occasion referred to was a solitary exception—one, no doubt, to be deplored, and a grievous error; but still an exception; and that Governor Gouldsbury is quite opposed to all such innovations.

Here we have commerce at its lowest ebb, agriculture without protection, religion and all material interests harassed and worried by vexatious edicts; men\'s liberties outraged, acts of violence and oppression following one after another, and people feeling themselves and their property altogether at the mercy of absolute, irresponsible, and evil-disposed men, of whom no account will probably be required by their masters, even if they should by chance ever know of what has been done. Without any reason that is known the Governor lately published the following edict: ""Be it known to the public from date that no meeting is to take place after sunset until its rising next morning, and the Government thinks fit to prohibit the meetings of the English Methodists between the hours of seven and eight o\'clock on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings.—By command of the Governor of this Colony, Sept. 19, 1878, Alejandro Arias Salgado."" The Governor had evidently received no good from his attendance at the four meetings immediately preceding the publication of his latest order. Carefully note the wording of this new law. Can anything be more peremptory or absolute, or more clearly show how desirous this man is to curtail the liberties and privileges of at least the Protestant portion of the public, which you know to be the bulk of the population of Santa Isabella? It is by command of the Governor. He does not even make the order in the name of his King; the King himself could not have been more peremptory. The man who has done this has also sent his men to forcibly take the keys of a man\'s safe and opening it, pay thereout a fine which he had inflicted. The same man also sent his people to go into a store and seize all the medicines in it (some of them having been ordered by a Government doctor and refused acceptance of), fining the owner of the store above 40l. for dealing in medicines, although they have been sold by all the stores ever since Europeans came to the island, and are a great boon to the public; but, ""I,"" the Governor, will not have it, and by virtue of the extraordinary discretionary powers with which ""I"" am entrusted, ""I"" seize and fine, and imprison, and transport. A mighty man is he (as the songs says of the blacksmith) in Fernando Po. But who is this mighty man, more powerful in his little sphere than King, or Emperor, or Czar? Outside this little island a very insignificant member of the ""great unknown"" These Governors come and go like comets, making a great stew and fuss whilst they last, and then disappear, never more to be heard of. Their reign is short and that is the only comfort we have when we get a bad one. But they are not all bad. We have had many good Governors, both military and naval, whose names are remembered with love and deep regard; but there were others whose base and evil dispositions have earned for them the maledictions of this most docile and tractable race of men. The system, however, of a two years\' governorship is a bad one. If we get a good earnest, sensible, far-seeing man, he is followed probably by one who is lazy, incapable, self-seeking and vain, with the result that he undoes all the good his predecessor has done. They are not long enough in office to take any real interest in their work. Little care have they for Fernando Po, so long as they draw their double pay, and turn their back on it when their term is ended; it is to the home Government that we must look for a remedy for these evils, which will some time become unendurable and end in violence. The Government has only to look at Cuba to see what official intolerance and disregard for the liberties of the people have done. A civil Governor, and one who knows something of the art of governing, as well as of the means best calculated to encourage agriculture and commerce, one with broad and liberal views of men and things in general, and who is willing to receive sound advice from those he has to govern—is the man wanted here; and he should be appointed for a term of five years. Compare the prosperous condition of the British Colonies along this Coast with the present condition of things here, and then let the Government ask what is the cause of it. The reason is not far to seek, in spite of the disadvantages of heavy duties levied in the British Colonies; and we shall have no improvement until the property and rights of the people here are made more secure from outrage, and a greater regard is shown for their convictions and privileges. As to the present Governor, it is suggested that those who have suffered through his injustice should band together and appeal for redress—legal redress—through the courts-of-law in Spain. A few hundred pounds would be well spent in bringing prominently before the Spanish public the doings of their irresponsible servants here, and would undoubtedly obtain the attention of the Spanish Government thereto.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Governor Freeman, before leaving Lagos for England, issued the following\n\n**PROCLAMATION.**\n\n*By his Excellency Henry Stanhope Freeman, Governor, Commander-in-Chief in and over the Settlement of Lagos and its Dependencies, and Vice Admiral of the same, &c., &c., &c.*\n\n""Whereas his Excellency is about to leave Lagos for a few months, and is desirous that the inhabitants should not have any cause or excuse for discontent during his absence; and whereas he has seen that in many parts of the town houses and premises are fallen down through want of proper protection from the rain, and knowing that Calabar mats cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers to repair all damages daily occurring:\n\n""His Excellency has therefore been pleased to postpone, for six months, carrying into execution the provisions of the Ordinance No. 8, of the 9th April, 1863.\n\n""In making this concession, his Excellency cannot but refer to the seditious spirit which was shown by the inhabitants of Lagos about six weeks ago, when compliance with the ordinance was urged upon them.\n\n""This rebellious spirit entirely prevented the accomplishment of the wishes of the people; for it is not by seditious meetings and threats of insurrection that this Government can be guided.\n\n""The inhabitants of Lagos having yielded and shown their respect for law and order, his Excellency has much pleasure in granting them their desire.""\n\nThis is a sample of the grandiloquent in African colonial government, and is characteristic of the course hitherto pursued in the colony where it was promulgated. Manifestly there ought never to have been occasion for such a proclamation as this. An order to cover all the houses with Calabar mats or other substitutes for the old thatch within six months, should never have been issued, unless it was certain that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the material for giving obedience to the law. We never saw a proclamation that so completely justified what the Governor calls ""a seditious"" and a ""rebellious"" spirit, as does this of Governor Freeman.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SUNDAY GIN AND RUM SHOPS IN LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—As being one of your subscribers to the African Times at Lagos, on the West Coast of Africa, I humbly pray you would permit me a little space in your most valuable paper, to point out something worthy of notice at Lagos, and which I do believe is entirely against an English ordinance in force in Her Majesty\'s settlements. The sale of spirituous liquors is here practised to a most fearful extent on the Lord\'s-day without the least dread; and what makes it a greater crime, as I may truly call it, and moves me to request you to have the goodness to notice it, disturbances created on these days by a certain class of barbarians, who come down to Lagos as mechanics and labourers, and whom no one can persuade by any means to go to church on Sundays, which they make their club-dancing days. I am anxious to know whether there is no ordinance provided in every British colony for the prohibition of such unlawful deeds. I know that at Sierra Leone the ordinance there forbids retailers to sell a single glass of any spirit after nine o\'clock on any night, much less on Sabbath days. For a violation of such ordinance such retailer would have to pay fifty pounds, and at the same time lose his licence for the time remaining. Mr. Editor, I wonder why this settlement of Lagos could not be trained in like manner with other British colonies and settlements? Is it not the same Queen rules over all and her representatives, especially a governor-general, Sir A. E. Kennedy, appointed over all the West Coast? Take notice also, Mr. Editor, that the hall where the untutored barbarians always have their dance on Sundays, after they have well beastified themselves, is the next door to a new-built Wesleyan Chapel, in Tinubu-square. The house belonged to a lately deceased person named Bambose. Many a time whilst the preacher is delivering his sermon to the congregation, he is compelled to stop through the uproar of this club. I will not forget to mention, also, the names of those whose rum and gin shop-doors are open on Sundays for the reception of the buyers. Their names are as follows: Mrs. ——, Mrs. ——, Mr. ——, Mr. ——, and Mr. ——. These are the principal sellers on Sundays. Mrs. —— is an Englishwoman, the rest are uncivilised persons. ""Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people."" We hope our Lagos Legislature may be induced by your notice to adopt measures for the prohibition of such detestable practices in future; for if the parents of any child are careless to train him up in early years, they will not be able to do it when that child comes to age.  \nA Spectator.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-12-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1872#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of Petition of the King, Chiefs, Headmen, &c., on the Gold Coast, to the Governor-General', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""That on the 28th of March, 1866, Mr. Charles Bannerman, acting under the instructions of his Excellency the Administrator, prosecuted King Aggery, in a magistrate's court, for alleged cruelty, in putting two of his own people in irons for disobedient and refractory conduct. The court was held by two military officers of the garrison. The King was arraigned as a criminal, and although the charge of unnecessary cruelty was not proved, he was subjected to a severe and unnecessary reprimand, with a warning that if another case be brought against him he should be punished as a common malefactor. Such conduct can only have one result—the subversion of all rule amongst the mass of the people, by lowering the King's dignity and authority. The office of the king as chief magistrate is the regulating the differences that arise among the mass of the people, in which their own laws, customs, and tradition are concerned—in fact, the domestic government of the people in those details that it would be impossible for any European to cope with, unacquainted with the native laws, customs, and traditions of the people. In a country like this, where nineteen-twentieths of the people are in a state of nature, wrongs will be committed, differences will arise, which could not be dealt with from a European point of view; and it is only under the penalty of the native laws and customs that evil-doers among the mass of the people are kept in check, because the mass understand their own laws and customs; not to say that they do not appreciate the Queen's courts, for as a rule the people gladly avail themselves of the law courts, but in a community of a half-million of uncivilised men, we say that circumstances frequently arise where native custom is of more avail than British laws. We must say the truth; the people cherish their own customs, revere their own laws, because they have been hallowed in their minds by tradition, whereas European customs and laws, however much they may be superior and transcendent to native laws and customs, are to the masses as yet only an extraneous growth, and for them to be fully and universally appreciated is a work of time.\n\nWe do not complain of the efforts that have been, and still continue to be made, to civilise our country; God forbid; but we do complain of the wholesale sweeping away of those means and appliances which tradition has prescribed for the good government of the masses of the people, before they are in condition to appreciate a better rule.

The soldiers of the garrison have suddenly issued forth at night, with some of their officers, and have treated this town as if they had taken it by assault in time of war. Houses have been broken open, their inmates dragged forth and slain, or wounded, or beaten, or taken to prison; property has been seized; neither sex, nor age, nor rank, nor condition has been spared; for among the victims are found male and female, old and young, rich and poor, sick and healthy. Men, asleep in their beds by the side of their wives, have been dragged forth through the window and put to death, with cruelties that make humanity shudder. An inquest has been held on the body of an unhappy man who was treated thus, and the jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the party of soldiers who committed the deed. God knows that it is no exaggeration to state that on this fearful night the soldiers went about the town indiscriminately killing, and wounding, and beating unarmed and unresisting men and helpless women. The list of casualties on the side of the people of the town, as ascertained up to the present, includes 2 men killed, and 58 men and 5 women wounded, bringing up the ascertained number to 65 persons killed and wounded, besides very many who were more or less severely beaten.

It is notorious, and is, I presume, not disputed in any quarter, that, as some of the townspeople were holding their annual native festival in the Anabfoo quarter, some soldiers rudely interrupted the festivities, and that a scuffle ensued. I appeal to the records of all the courts of the Gold Coast as to whether the natives are now, or ever have been, in the habit of either injuring, or insulting, or annoying the military. Unhappily, those records tell us too often and too plainly that the soldiers have long been to us a constant source of great anxiety, and uneasiness, and alarm, by their incessant and uncalled-for attacks upon unoffending persons in market-places, on the highways, in the public streets, in private houses, by day and by night.

After this he was, of course, let alone, and the Sabbath was desecrated as if by sanction of the laws. Now, this, under British rule and in a British settlement, should not be. This is a point on which there can be no doubt entertained. The religious instinct of the English nation is decidedly dead against working on the Lord\'s-day.

The enclosed copy of a letter will show you that no such thing is likely to be encouraged by the officials out here. No nation can get on well without revenue, and see how they prevent us, and interfere in our affairs, advising the other king of the Confederation not to pay a tax which his fellow-kings have paid. Yet they recommend union, while they despite the councillors elected by the kings which includes themselves. This council consists of kings, chiefs, captains, and headmen, &c., of the country. The Administrator sent to tell King Enimill and his people that they are English people, and that he will support them; and when it comes to the point that the King of Ashantee has sent a troop to King Affoo, of Appolonia, and King Bunimill sent for ammunition of war, they were denied to him; while the Dutch Government seek to subdue King Affoo to their master, the King of Ashantee. We were told that in time of war we have to protect ourselves in the interior, but in time of peace they send summonses to the interior to enforce their jurisdiction to fifty miles or more from the coast, with British constables or policemen. Is this right? One fights and protests and another reaps the benefits.\n\nMr. Editor, one cannot help saying something when he sees the conduct of the Administrator. I know had not your former able correspondents been kept silent by the favour showed them by officials, they would have written you many things about it. It has become the public saying now about Europeans that their words are not to be relied upon. At the close of last year the Administrator, H. T. Ussher, sent to each king in the interior one anker of rum, with his proclamation that the Dutch have sold all their settlements on the Gold Coast to the Queen of England—the guns, the powder, the bullets, and flints, &c., &c.—all ammunitions of war and the land; and that the English flag will be hoisted on the Dutch fort on January 1, 1871, and that the Governor-general will come out with it; that, therefore, the Fantees must lay down their arms. The Fantees believed his word and did as he requested. The 1st of January comes, and no sign of English flag to Elmina. Then it was to come in April. April comes, and still no sign. Then in July; July comes and nothing of the kind. Now November is at hand, and the Dutch...', 'last_edit_date': '1871-09-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Outrage on a British Captain by Africans', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That the Local Government believe more in police and gaols, as you have observed, than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education, is self-evident; for whereas several thousands of pounds are annually voted to the former and expended, the few hundred pounds voted to the latter are doled out so niggardly and irregularly, that it seems almost a matter of regret an ordinance was ever passed in its favour.

The first is, that the new duties have now been in force over six months without any measures being adopted conducive to the public benefit; and three civil commandants, all unacquainted with the country, having succeeded each other in that office during the past four months. The other grievance tells more powerfully on the interior, and involves the question of domestic slavery; some of the recent proceedings of Judge Parker having led to an impression that the Government intends to liberate the domestic slaves by force. I forbear any comment on these\n\nquestions just now. It is clear to me, however, that, humanly speaking, if our authorities at the Colonial-office do not bestir themselves, and efficiently reorganise and pacify the whole country, both the coast and interior, they may, ere long, as a point of national honour, bitterly regret the delay, and either have to abandon a ruined country, or call upon the nation (England) for the means of a large outlay of money to destroy the hydra which has been so unhappily allowed to grow into such mischievous proportions.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-08-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.612, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE JAMAICA INQUIRY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the conclusions at which they arrived Her Majesty\'s Government generally concur. There can be no doubt that the disturbances in St. Thomas-in-the-East had their origin in a planned resistance to the constituted authority, and the Government think that Governor Eyre deserves all the commendation which is bestowed upon him for the skill, promptitude, and vigour which he manifested during the early stages of the insurrection. As regards the proclamation of martial law, Her Majesty\'s Government agree with the Commissioners, that the Council of War had good reason for the advice which they gave, and that the Governor was well justified in acting upon that advice. The following passage relates to the conclusions at which the Commissioners had arrived with respect to the continuance of martial law in its full force to the extreme limit of its statutory operation, and to the excessive nature of the punishment inflicted: \'In reviewing this painful portion of the case, the greatest consideration is due to a Governor placed in the circumstances in which Governor Eyre was placed. The suddenness of the insurrection; the uncertainty of its possible extent; its avowed character as a contest of colour; the atrocities committed at its first outbreak; the great disparity in numbers between the white and the black populations; the real dangers and the vague alarms by which he was on every side surrounded; the inadequacy of the force at his command to secure superiority in every district; the exaggerated statements which reached him continually from distant parts of the island; the vicinity of Hayti, and the fact that a civil war was at the time going on in that country—all these circumstances tended to impress his mind with a conviction that the worst consequences were to be apprehended from the slightest appearance of indecision."" After stating that it should not be forgotten that Governor Eyre showed himself superior to the feelings of alarm which others entertained by refusing to proclaim other parts of the island, the despatch, to do full justice to the Governor, quotes his reasons for the continuance of martial law. Having given these reasons, the despatch proceeds to say: ""On the other hand, however, it must be borne in mind that martial law, and the execution of capital sentences under martial law, continued for the full period of a month authorised by the statute, although after the few first days of the insurrection no serious outrages were committed by the insurgents, nor was any resistance offered to the troops."" Her Majesty\'s Government are compelled to express their concurrence in the last conclusions of the Commissioners as to the excessive punishments which were inflicted. Upon this subject the despatch contains the following passage: ""It appears to them (the Government) to be evident that, even in the first excitement of the disturbances, and still more at some later period, if martial law was allowed to continue, instructions ought to have been issued to the officers to whom the actual conduct of the operations was entrusted, which would have rendered such an abuse of power impossible. They agree entirely in the words which you have used, that \'much which is now lamented might have been avoided if clear and precise instructions had been given for the regulation of the conduct of those engaged in the suppression, and every officer had been made to understand that he would be held responsible for the slightest departure from those instructions. It does not seem reasonable to send officers upon a very difficult and perfectly novel service without instructions, and to leave everything to their judgment.\'""', 'last_edit_date': '1866-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1866#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Blockade of Dahoman Ports', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'That the Local Government believe more in police and gaols, as you have observed, than in the purifying and ameliorating influences of religious education, is self-evident; for whereas several thousands of pounds are annually voted to the former and expended, the few hundred pounds voted to the latter are doled out so niggardly and irregularly, that it seems almost a matter of regret an ordinance was ever passed in its favour.
