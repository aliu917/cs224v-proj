253,"Portugal's ineffective management and strategic weakness in Delagoa Bay, coupled with obstructive actions against British interests, highlight its declining colonial power and reliance on English diplomatic support.","The claim regarding Portugal's ineffective management and strategic weakness in Delagoa Bay, coupled with obstructive actions against British interests, is supported by observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, albeit with varying emphases. The General History of Africa does not explicitly address Portugal's management or strategic actions in Delagoa Bay, nor does it directly discuss any obstruction of British interests in that region. However, it highlights Portugal's broader colonial challenges, such as its initial weakness in controlling African colonies, reliance on forced labor due to a lack of capital, and the inefficiency and corruption of its colonial administration. These factors suggest a general decline in Portuguese colonial power, indirectly supporting the claim of strategic weakness. Additionally, the text notes Portugal's reliance on diplomatic maneuvers with Great Britain, aligning with the claim of dependence on English diplomatic support. In contrast, The African Times provides specific details supporting the claim, highlighting Portugal's inability to effectively govern and develop its East African territories, with native populations resisting its control. The articles criticize the arbitration decision by Marshal MacMahon, which favored Portugal's claim to Delagoa Bay, as a mistake, indicating that Portugal's historical claims lacked effective sovereignty or development. They also describe Portugal's obstructive policies at Delagoa Bay, which hindered British trade and colonization efforts, and mention the controversial seizure of the Delagoa Bay Railway as a political blunder. Furthermore, the articles emphasize Portugal's reliance on English diplomatic support amid diplomatic tensions, necessitating British intervention to protect its interests. Together, these observations underscore Portugal's declining colonial power, strategic weaknesses, and reliance on English diplomatic support, while also highlighting its obstructive actions against British interests.","The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly discuss Portugal's management or strategic actions in Delagoa Bay, nor does it directly address any obstructive actions against British interests in that region.

The specific character of Portuguese colonialism and, to a measure, the popular opposition which it generated, stem from four sets of factors the initial weakness of the colonial state, the progressively authoritarian nature of the colonial regime, the lack of Portuguese capital and a con› comitant dependence upon forced labour and the policy of assimilation.\nBy the eve of the First World War appreciable areas of both Angola and Mozambique remained outside Lisbon\'s effective control. Whereas the colonial administration was well entrenched in the coastal urban en› claves such as Luanda, Benguela, Beira and Lourenço Marques and their hinterlands, throughout vast interior regions the colonial presence was nominal and often depended on an alliance with local chiefs and African police whose loyalty was problematical.\nIn Angola, for example, as late as 1914, the Ovambo in the south remained effectively independent while revolts smouldered in the adjacent region of Ganguela until 1917 and the Lunda homelands of Quioco were only occupied in 1920. To the north opposition in the Congo region con› tinued until 1915 while Dembo insurgents defied the colonial state until 1918. 62 Portugal\'s position in Mozambique was only slightly better. Several northern sultanates and Yao chieftaincies had effectively defied the colonial regime until 1914 and the Makonde highlands remained outside the sphere of colonial rule as late as 1921. Moreover, during the First World War when German forces from neighbouring Tanganyika invaded northern Mozambique, they were greeted as liberators by a number of Makua chieftaincies which had suffered under the extremely harsh rule of the Niassa Company. Even in the southern half of the colony, where the colonial state was most firmly entrenched, officials feared a massive uprising (see Fig. 27.2).""', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview', 'content': ""In the aftermath of the war, Lisbon intensified the autocratic nature of its rule.

Throughout the period under examination, Portugal's ability to extract resources from her African colonies depended on the mobilization and control of unfree labour because her own economy, which was both archaic and on the verge of bankruptcy, lacked the capacity to export the fixed capital necessary for development. An 1899 government commission, whose task it was to analyse the prospects for development in Angola and Mozambique, had been unequivocal on this last point: We need native labour, we need it in order to better the conditions of these labourers, we need it for the economy of Europe and for the progress of Africa. Our tropical Africa will not grow without the Africans. The capital needed to exploit it, and it so needs to be exploited, lies in the procurement of labour for exploitation. Abun› dant, cheap, solid labour ... and this given the circumstances, will never be supplied by European immigrants. 64 The state had also introduced a series of tax laws designed to force many African agriculturalists off their land and create the beginnings of a semi-proletariat. While the tax laws did provide the colonial administra› tion with a new source of revenue, they failed to generate a cheap labour force on the scale anticipated by the colonial regime. Many peasants were able to circumvent the labour requirement by cultivating new or additional cash crops to pay their taxes.

Events certainly played their part, and the military setbacks inflicted on the Portuguese by the Africans go some way towards explaining the ebb of colonial occupation during the period 1862-72. Personalities also influenced developments; certain governors were associ› ated with an aggressive policy of maximum occupation, others with a retreat to coastal bases. However, these factors do not assume their real significance unless they are placed in the context of world economic developments, particularly in so far as they affected the Portuguese economy. Indeed, Portuguese imperialism did not escape the general rules of colonial expansion in the nineteenth century. 19 The determination of the protectionists to ensure that Portugal and its colonies were united in an economic system independent of the great industrial powers was reflected in the first attempts to set up a white colony in the south of Angola, beginning on the coast at Moçâmedes, and at Huila in the Nyaneka country. The spirit of conquest was still uppermost in the 1850s, with sustained Portuguese efforts to occupy territory and eliminate competition from African traders, in particular the Imbangala and the Kongo. Not until i860 or thereabouts, following some years of thriving trade, was a turning-point reached, with the Portuguese increasingly adopt› ing a policy of withdrawal. From 1862 to 1875, the colonial power continued to retreat, suffering a series of military defeats at Cassanga in 1862, and in the Dembo country in 1871-2, which the government at Luanda did not seek to avenge. By the early 1870s the withdrawal was complete. The colonial power in Angola had fallen back to the coast, and Africans were rapidly gaining control of trade in the sertào. Silva Porto, the leading sertanejo of the BiØ area, lost his entire fortune in this period under the pressure of competition from the Ovimbundu traders.

They did, however, have several means of escaping the pressures that were brought to bear on them.\nThe first form of resistance consisted of taking up arms, but this was steadily abandoned from the end of the First World War since it was ultimately and hopelessly doomed to failure. There were fewer and fewer leaders, most weapons had been confiscated and gunpowder was, with a few exceptions, no longer available on the open market. The second alternative was to go into hiding. When the situation became intolerable, entire villages abandoned their fields and moved to areas furthest from the reach of the colonial authorities.

Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final. There is widespread evidence of massive clandestine emigration into the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia and even South West Africa. Often members of the rural population travelled great distances through harsh terrain with young children on their backs to free themselves from the tyranny of Portuguese colonial rule. If they were caught by the colonial authorities or the local African police, the men were beaten and imprisoned and the women sexually abused.\nThe fourth type of resistance to colonial rule were the religious or messianic cults founded by Africans in reaction to the colonial religion.

Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast. Above all, the Asantehene was deposed partly as a result of the outcome of the 1874"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.58, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 79, 'article_title': 'NATAL.', 'full_section_title': 'NATAL.', 'last_edit_date': '11-05-1862', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1863#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_01_1863', 'content': ""The Waldensian steamer, carrying the mails between Natal and the Cape, has been wrecked, and become a total loss.

Inyack is much healthier for a settlement than the mainland. Delagos Bay is the natural outlet of a large range of territories extending far inland, and more or less thickly populated by native tribes. One or two partially navigable rivers empty their waters into the large bay, and flow down from the hunting grounds of the interior. The export of ivory from Natal is fast decreasing, owing to the formidable opposition of the Portuguese traders, who seem determined that they alone shall have the power of trading with the natives in that part; while they at the same time take advantage of the freedom of trade in Natal to bring ivory out of the interior also by that route, and ship it from Durban to Delagoa Bay, as they have lately done, to be transhipped from the latter place to Lisbon.

We shall not call in question the impartiality of the judge, nor deny that there is some force in the technical grounds upon which he bases his decision. We believe, however, that the issue is to be deplored in the interests of civilization and commerce, and that the process by which it has been arrived at demonstrates conclusively that it is an utter mistake to resort to arbitration for the settlement of controversies of the class to which the Delagoa Bay case belongs. It is for the most part on purely technical grounds that the Marshal has given judgment in favour of Portugal. He finds that she discovered Delagoa Bay in the sixteenth century, and ""that in the seventeenth and eighteenth she occupied \'various points\' on the northern coast of it. Against this, the facts that she has never exercised any real sovereignty over it, and that it was practically in the possession of the native chiefs when it was transferred to us in 1823, are set down as of no force whatever. The development of the country is wrested from the hands of a Power equal to the task, and handed over to a nation which, once a great colonizing agency, is now effete and incapable of enterprise. Why, it may be asked, does Portugal, after having tacitly acquiesced for many years in the cession of the territory to England, suddenly come forward to assert the pretensions which she had practically abandoned? It is not due to a fervid zeal for the amelioration of the condition of the natives nor even to the sense of a capacity to develop the natural advantages and resources of the Bay and its adjacent territories. There is reason to assume that her passion for the possession was inspired by the circumstance that she had found a purchaser for it. Delagoa Bay, which is about fifty miles across, and has splendid riding-ground for ships of the largest class, is one of the most important of all the natural harbours on the East African Coast. It is conveniently situated for purposes of trade, and is therefore much resorted to by vessels of all nations trading to the East African ports. The Portuguese, with their limited means, could not make much capital out of it, but certain speculators of the Transvaal Republic perceived the advantages to be secured by obtaining for their inland State a harbour so favourably situated for communication with the world beyond. They knew it was hopeless to obtain it by purchase from England, and there is reason to believe that Portugal has been encouraged to claim the Bay on the faith of an assurance that, once in possession, she will speedily find a buyer for it. It is possible that the award of Marshal MacMahon will considerably advance the prospects of this speculation.'}, {'id': 2942, 'article_title': ""The Standard on Marshal MacMahon's Award in the Delagoa Bay Arbitration"", 'full_section_title': ""The Standard on Marshal MacMahon's Award in the Delagoa Bay Arbitration"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1875#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_09_1875', 'content': '\n\ndiscourage colonizing enterprise and warn off trade and commerce. Men will think twice before embarking their capital or their energies in settlements which may at any moment be repossessed by the Power which originally discovered them. Marshal MacMahon lays it down with perfect truth that Portugal can show this title; but how can the fact of the discovery of Delagoa Bay and its dependencies in the sixteenth century make good her pretensions to exercise sovereign rights over them in the nineteenth? If Portugal held now all the territories she has ever discovered, she would be a considerable Power; but in her weakness and decay she has neglected them, and let them slip from her hold, and she cannot expect to resume her sovereignty over them after the lapse of centuries merely because she may perceive a chance of selling them. Again, it is true, as Marshal MacMahon observes, that Portugal has several times claimed sovereign rights over the whole Bay and the territories bordering it, and has twice supported her pretensions by force of arms, the last occasion being in 1781. But what has been the position of Portugal in East Africa during the present century? Its enterprise had died out, the native populations it had subjected threw off its yoke, and everywhere it was supplanted. As British colonization, and the authority and presence of the British Government with it, swept along the coasts of Southern and Eastern Africa, we advanced up to Delagoa Bay, and there we found no trace of Portuguese sovereignty, but that the territories were under the rule and in the possession of the native chiefs. We treated with them, and such rights as we now claim we hold in virtue of contracts and engagements freely entered into by them, without exciting any protest on the part of the Portuguese Government. On the strength of these engagements, British settlers established themselves on the southern shores of the Bay and the territories in its vicinity without the slightest sign of opposition from the Portuguese Government, which has never, until within the last few years, given any indication that it claimed sovereign rights over them. We cannot think that Marshal MacMahon has satisfactorily disposed of the rights thus acquired by Great Britain. He takes the case of the treaty concluded in 1823 between Captain Owen, on behalf of England, and the native chiefs of Tembe and Maputo. Upon this the Marshal observes that, ""although the accidental weakening of the Portuguese authority in those parts may in 1823 have led Captain Owen erroneously, yet in good faith, to regard the native chiefs as really independent of the Crown of Portugal, the conventions concluded with them were none the less contrary to the rights of Portugal."" It seems to us hardly fair to speak of Portugal\'s practical abandonment of such sovereign rights as she ever possessed—a state of things which had lasted for a considerable number of years—as ""an accidental weakening of the Portuguese authority."" For a century past the power of Portugal has been shrivelling up all along the coast of Eastern Africa.

It did not, however, in any way surprise us. Not that we had at all antecedently made up our minds that Portugal had any valid claim to the whole of Delagoa Bay,—we were no more satisfied then that such was the case than we are now; but that we hold it to be almost impossible for any foreign arbitrators to pronounce in favour of Great Britain in any territorial dispute whatever that may be referred to them. We have had some experience at foreign Courts; we know something of the bitter feeling which exists everywhere among those whom a foreign arbitrating Sovereign would consult, and whose decision would become the decision of that Sovereign, respecting the widely extended possessions of Great Britain in every quarter of the globe; and we should hesitate, if any share of Ministerial responsibility rested on us, to vote for referring a dispute between Great Britain and any other Power to such arbitration, unless it were a matter that must be disposed of in order to avert the bitter arbitrament of war, and in which it were better far that we should lose, however unjustly, than that we should maintain our right at the expense of human blood and human misery, which are necessarily war\'s attendants. There was not any such reason why this Delagoa Bay matter should have been referred to arbitration, and we never could understand why it was so referred at all. Portugal has no good use for Delagoa Bay. There is no chance of her extending her settlements there, because she has not the power to effect such extension. A determination on the part of Great Britain to maintain her right to Inyack Island and Peninsula, and Elephant Island, with the southern shores of the Bay, would not have inflicted any hardship on Portugal, or caused her the slightest loss or inconvenience in any good object she might have in view, to atone for the injury she has done of late years by her settlement at Mozambique, and authority exercised over the northern and north-western portions of Delagoa Bay. We think, therefore, that it was a needless courting of injustice and injury, a needless placing in jeopardy important future interests of our South African Colonies and their people, to have gratified Portugal by agreeing to a reference respecting her claim to Inyack Island and the southern portion of the Bay. The British Government might at least have waited until after 1878 to see how, and in what spirit, Portugal should have fulfilled those treaty obligations by which she has bound herself to put an end to negro slavery in all parts of her dominions. It has been done, however, with the result usually attending arbitrations where British rights and claims are in dispute, and we must abide by the issue. It has been decided by Marshal MacMahon\'s advisers, and the decision has been confirmed by him, that Portugal is entitled to all that Great Britain claimed in Delagoa Bay. What will she do with it? Occupy, fortify, and colonize it, she cannot. She might, perhaps, have managed to do it in a certain fashion had she not been under treaty obligations as regards the slave-trade, and for the cessation of all slavery within her territories after another two years. Now she is entirely unable to do so. The Standard, in the article we transferred last month to our columns, containing the best comments made by the daily press on the subject, states there is reason to assume that the passion of Portugal for the present right of possession was inspired by the circumstance that she had found a purchaser, and that the purchaser will be ""certain speculators of the Transvaal Republic."" We shall be glad if it be so, though we do not believe it. We should be glad of it, because the acquisition of the territory and sea rights on the part of the Transvaal Republic by purchase would obviate a future necessity of acquiring these by force of arms. We look forward to the time when there will be but one Government ruling the entire territory from Table Bay to Delagoa Bay; and it would be absurd to imagine for a moment that such a Government would treat as anything better than waste paper the supposed title conferred by the late award of the President of the French Republic. We must confess that our fears, when we beheld the persistent efforts of Portugal to obtain, if possible, the confirmation of supposed rights, which, if obtained, she could not directly utilize, pointed in a direction widely different from that of the Transvaal Republic. Whatever may be the case at present, we have reason to believe that those fears were not at that time groundless. We hope, though we are far from entirely believing it, that they are so now; because to have beheld those fears realized, would have been to witness a complication in the affairs of South-eastern Africa that would far outweigh any advantages to that portion of the world which the presence there of another strong civilizing European Power might have conferred, had there not been neighbouring civilized Colonies rapidly rising to empire.'}, {'id': 3322, 'article_title': 'THE LIVINGSTONIA MISSION TO LAKE NYASSA.', 'full_section_title': 'THE LIVINGSTONIA MISSION TO LAKE NYASSA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-24', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': ""Before the arrival of the second party, headed by the Rev.

Houses, workshops, &c., had been constructed. Lieutenant Young and his party, it may be well understood, were not idle. When this second party arrived they were cheered to find that the noble undertaking was well begun. It certainly is not to the credit of the Portuguese authorities at Quillimane that they should have thrown obstacles in the way of Dr. Stewart's party, which was detained there for 14 days. We are aware of the fact that Sir Henry Barkly gave special letters of commendation to the Portuguese Governor. If ever an expedition was to be commended as in the cause of civilization and progress, the Livingstonia one was. They were charged 26 per cent custom dues—an undoubtedly exorbitant tariff—and obstacles thrown in their way besides. It was the idea of the Rev. Dr. Black that a postal route might be opened up at once between the lake and Nyassa, but as far as we can understand from what Lieutenant Young tells us, the Portuguese at Quillimane have their interests otherwise than with progress and the spread of civilization in Africa. How easily such a postal route could be organized is apparent when we state that Lieutenant Young has succeeded in making a treaty with two of the most important tribes in the route *via* Quillimane, the Cataracts of the Shira, and Nyassa. These tribes are the Maviti, near the lake, and the Makololo, 150 miles off, at the Cataracts. They know the name of England, and trust it. As Lieutenant Young says, now an Englishman may go through the whole country with a walking-stick; but a Portuguese requires armed force. It is to be hoped that something will be done by the English authorities which will compel the Portuguese to give way to the progress of events in that part of the continent of Africa.

Well, he would not say that a civilized jurisdiction, in which the natives could have confidence, in which the merchants could have confidence, and which would produce a better state of things than now existed—he would not say that such a jurisdiction might not be desirable. It ought to be within the capacity of England and the other powers of Europe to establish such a jurisdiction if it was necessary. But the jurisdiction of Portugal would not be such a jurisdiction as he had described. In the very case he had spoken of in which the British Consul asked the Portuguese Governor to punish the murderers of the thirty negroes, after an inquiry had been held, the Consul had a belief that it was altogether unsatisfactory, and that it was not a real inquiry. And it would be easy to show that in the Portuguese Colonies of Africa deeds probably as horrible—certainly many very dreadful deeds—were perpetrated which did not meet with any adequate punishment. Some newspapers, the Times for instance—and he thought also the Manchester Guardian, the other day—leaned somewhat to the view that on some terms or other Portugal might perhaps be allowed to go to this region. What did the merchants say? They said, We would not have Portugal on any terms; we do not trust her; no kind of bargain which she might make with us would give us any kind of security. In the despatch he had spoken of, Portugal said, Of course if we go to the Congo it will be an exception; we won’t establish the tariffs, and we won’t do there as in other colonies. That was very much like an admission that her other colonies were not in a very satisfactory state. She said that if she went to the Congo her tariff should not exceed the lowest tariff that existed in any part of the world. He scarcely knew where the lowest tariff existed, but he supposed it was in Turkey. If Portugal said, We will never have a higher tariff than five per cent., or seven or eight per cent., that would give no kind of security to the merchants of these various countries. They might bind Portugal to that agreement, but what were they to do with regard to her internal government, her internal taxation, with regard to the wonderful capacity she had of obstructing and delaying every kind of commercial proceeding, however small? (Hear, hear.) The Portuguese Government said not only that they would have very low duties, but that the navigation of the river should be absolutely free. But unless the banks of a river were free, how could the river be said to be free? (Hear, hear.) Although there was considerable commerce on the Congo, it was not so great as to induce ocean steamers to go from the sea up the 115 miles of river on which they could ply without difficulty if they chose to do so. Goods were unloaded and put upon smaller vessels to go up the stream. If Portugal was planted on the Congo, with all her machinery of custom houses, and all her genius for delay, what would become of the trade represented by the goods that would have to be unloaded and reloaded in Portuguese possessions? Men who talked glibly about putting Portugal on the banks of the Congo and abolishing the sway of the native chiefs, should remember the important fact of the difference betwixt the two provinces of Zanzibar and Mozambique. Mozambique was a great province on the eastern coast of Africa, and alongside of it was Zanzibar. Zanzibar, which was under native rule, had a trade eight or ten times as large as Mozambique, which was a province of Portugal. (Hear, hear.) The British Government for half a century had exercised an influence which had kept the Congo region free, and made it impossible for Portugal to go there. He contended that the influence which had done this in the past might do it in the future; and he should have very little faith in, or admiration for, the statesmanship of England or the statesmanship of Europe, if it allowed a region so important now and so promising for the future to be blighted by passing into the possession of such a power as Portugal.

To the southward of Loando the Portuguese claim the coast-line as far south as Cape Frio, a distance of about 580 miles. The territory untraced in this area, which extends across a considerable portion of the Dark Continent, is the richest and most fertile on the West Coast of Africa. In the hands of a really civilized and enterprising European Power it would be capable of great things; in the possession of Portugal it advances but little. The Portuguese do not possess sufficient capital to work and develop it even if they had the enterprise to do so, which they most decidedly have not, and their jealousy of foreigners, which takes the form of heavy protective duties on foreign trade, prevents, to a great extent, the opening out of the country by foreigners. In my last letter I mentioned the great river Coanza, which throws itself into the sea a little to the southward of St. Paul de Loando. This river is at present being worked by an English firm, which has a house at Lisbon, and manages by this means to in some measure elude the heavy duties levelled against foreigners: its goods have, however, to pass through Portugal, which, though it lessens the duties, materially increases the freight; the transhipping, rail charges, and re-shipping being heavy items. I was unable to ascend this river, as time did not permit, but I was informed, on reliable authority, that it is capable of being the highway of a vast trade, and that it passes through a country unsurpassed in beauty, wealth, and fertility by any other in Africa. Proceeding a little further down the coast, one arrives at the town of St. Philip de Benguela, a place of great importance in the days when slavery was in full vigour in these parts, but now rapidly falling into decay. Ruined buildings and roofless churches tell of better days, or at least of days when wealth was more abundant, however little we can approve of the means by which it was obtained. Benguela, as it is usually termed for brevity's sake, is an extremely unhealthy place, but that is a fact that can scarcely be wondered at. It does not at present pay the Portuguese Government in a pecuniary sense, mainly because the harbour is bad or has become bad by neglect, and nothing is done in the town to enforce a compliance with even the ordinary decencies of life, much less the most trivial sanitary laws. If the harbour were dredged, and capital could find its way into this place, there does not appear to me to be any reason why Benguela should not achieve something of its former importance."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the Berlin Conference', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter has been addressed to Lord Granville by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce with reference to the alleged claims of Portugal to possessions on the Congo: ""Authentic information has reached this Chamber that the Government of Portugal is again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and over the adjacent territories, and that this action on her part is an impediment to the conclusion of the deliberations of the Berlin Conference.

I am sorry some person more able than I am has not written to you, pointing out the fallacies it contained. I am not aware of any treaties with England in which she has recognized the ‘indisputable rights of sovereignty of Portugal over territories situated on the West Coast of Africa between lat. 5 south and 8·12 south.’ My contention is that Portugal has never, up to the year 1868, exercised any of the rights of sovereignty over that part of the coast. The officers of Her Majesty\'s squadron were instructed to inform the chiefs that England did not recognize the sovereignty of Portugal; that the limit of her colony was Ambriz, north of which she had no right to levy duties. From that town north to Cape Lopez Gonsalvez, up to 1870, the English senior officer of the Southern division was appealed to by people of all nations when difficulties arose with the natives, which were usually settled by an amicable ‘palaver.’ Sometimes force had to be resorted to. To take one instance, the Dutch at Banana had a disagreement with the chiefs of Porta da Zinha, and their factory there was threatened with an attack. They represented the case to me. We ran up the River Congo with one of their vessels in tow, lay with our guns covering their factory, and kept a watch at their quarters for forty-eight hours. The goods were shipped, and their *employés* brought off in safety. But before we were a gun-shot distant on return down the river, the natives rushed in, and the factory was in flames. Life and much property was saved, and not a shot was fired. Instances might be multiplied without end to prove that England supplied the police of the river, and that in squabbles between white men and natives, and even between rival factories, the British man-of-war was constantly appealed to. Their doctors, without payment, did their best for Hamburghers, Portuguese, or English, and their crews were ever ready to help a vessel of any nation in difficulty or distress. I grant the willingness of the Portuguese to assist, but they were seldom there, and they had nothing like sufficient force. Portugal may have indisputable rights of sovereignty, but prior to 1870 she certainly did not, or simply could not, exercise those rights. The foreign slave-trade in the territory claimed by Portugal may be said to have come to an end in 1865. Prior to that time, so far from the authorities at St. Paul de Loanda having encouraged legitimate trade, they seemed to do what they could to prevent it. And who can wonder?

The memorial pointed out that the occupations by France and the late annexations by Germany of small portions of the West Coast of Africa tended to break the continuity of the British protectorate, and to bring about a greater conflict of national interests. The influence of the British authorities with the natives was lessened, and the introduction of different principles of trading seriously affected the prosperity of British trades. The duties upon spirits, arms, and ammunition levied in the British settlements furnished the greater portion of the Government revenues. In German and French settlements these articles were free from duty, and being to a great extent sold in the same markets as the British goods, competition became so keen that the loss to British revenue and trade must ultimately be very great. The Committee recommended that the Chamber should ask the Foreign Office that while negotiations regarding African territories were pending, something might be done, by exchange or otherwise, to induce Germany, at least, to withdraw from the ports where British trade had become established, and where rivalry upon different commercial and political principles was so injurious. The Government might also take into consideration the extension of the British protectorate to the unoccupied portions of the coast alluded to. It was moved that the Chamber should forward to the Foreign Office a memorial on the lines of that submitted by the African Trade Section. This resolution was unanimously agreed to.

However, I told them that, if they would send in their claims, I would present them to the Portuguese Government, but that I doubted very much if they would be paid.

The rising is still not suppressed; in fact, fighting between the insurgents and the Government troops is almost of daily occurrence. Some few weeks since the natives attacked a post and killed the Commandant. The rising did not take place in Bulama, which is an island, but on the mainland, in the Bissao River, which is about fifteen miles from the island of Bulama, and about 220 miles north from here. It is hard to say what the grievance of the people is. The statement of the Portuguese officials is that the people have nothing to complain about. Some time ago the Telegraph Station there wired to Sierra Leone for assistance, as they were afraid of being attacked, but when her Majesty's ship Sparrow got there, it was found that the alarm had subsided, and not being required, she left. A Hamburg firm established there also asked for assistance from the Foreign Office at Berlin, and in reply a German gunboat, the Hyaene, was sent from Cameroon to protect German interests, if necessary.\n\nA private wire from Bissao stated that the Portuguese tried to come to some arrangement with the insurgents, but failed. As a preliminary, the rebels demanded the heads of four officers. Of course, there being no likelihood of such a concession being made, the palaver was broken off. The natives of that part of the coast are a fine race of men, and fight well. Regular troops will have to be sent out from Lisbon before peace and quietness are re-established. So far, they have not attacked any factories or trading stations belonging to foreigners. This is rather unusual, as in most disturbances the natives generally plunder the trading stations in the first instance.\n\nWith regard to the origin of the rebellion in the Bissao River, it appears that a Papel had come into the town of Bissao to buy spirits. After having done this it may be assumed that he became drunk and noisy. The police attempted to arrest him, but did not succeed, as his friends resisted, and from this small beginning the rebellion arose. The police, seeing themselves out-numbered, fired on the friends of the man, and thus made matters much worse. Eventually the Papels left the town, but remained in the immediate vicinity, where they were joined by the Grumetas (the labourers of the factories). The gates of the town were then closed, and a siege was commenced. The Portuguese endeavoured to raise it by sending 150 native soldiers, led by Portuguese officers, but they were repulsed, and returned to the town with some loss in dead and wounded. In consequence of this reverse, a contingent of 300 Mandingoes was ordered to Bissao to occupy it. These Mandingoes attempted an attack on the insurgents, sallying out of the town without their officers, but after a protracted fight, had to retire into the town with the loss of their guns and ammunition, as well as a large number of killed and wounded."", 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE PORTUGUESE IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Lisbon Official Gazette of Sept. 10 published a decree defining the limits of the new Portuguese East Africa Company's territory to be the river on the north, except in its upper courses, the frontier province thus being Mozambique.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'QUARANTINE AT MADEIRA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Portuguese Government has issued a decree, signed on December 29, which declares that the West Coast of Africa is infected by yellow fever, and subjects ships from that coast to quarantine.

The textbook highlights the rampant economic exploitation in Angola and Mozambique, driven by Portugal's inability to invest in development, and underscores the reliance on forced labor and harsh tax laws, which stifled economic progress. It also points to the limited control over vast interior regions, where alliances with local chiefs were necessary, illustrating the administration's inefficiency and lack of effective governance.

The skepticism and resistance from local populations, along with criticism from African intellectuals and organizations, align with the claim of skepticism about Portugal's governance capabilities. Similarly, The African Times articles criticize the Portuguese for their inefficiency and corruption, noting excessive duties and protective tariffs that hindered trade and development. The articles describe Portuguese officials as corrupt and poorly paid, exacerbating inefficiencies and burdens on the local population. They express skepticism about Portugal's ability to maintain influence, citing a lack of capital and enterprise, and highlight the negative economic impact by comparing Portuguese-controlled regions unfavorably with those under native rule, such as Zanzibar. The aversion of merchants to potential Portuguese control over the Congo further emphasizes the lack of trust in Portugal's governance.

For instance, the articles mention the excessive duties and protective tariffs imposed by the Portuguese, which hindered trade and economic development. The articles also describe the Portuguese officials as corrupt and poorly paid, leading to further inefficiencies and exactions on the local population. Additionally, the articles express skepticism about Portugal's ability to maintain influence, citing their lack of capital and enterprise to develop the regions they controlled. The negative impact on economic development is further illustrated by comparisons with regions under native rule, such as Zanzibar, which had significantly more trade than Portuguese-controlled Mozambique. The articles also highlight the aversion of merchants and other stakeholders to the possibility of Portuguese control over the Congo, emphasizing the lack of trust in Portugal's ability to govern effectively. Overall, the articles align with the claim by portraying Portugal's colonial administration as inefficient, corrupt, and detrimental to economic progress in Africa.",True,532,Colonial Administration,Critique of Portuguese Colonial Administration,"[{'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview', 'content': ""The third common feature was the particular character of economic exploitation in Angola and Mozambique which was shaped by the impoverishment of the mother country. Throughout the period under examination, Portugal's ability to extract resources from her African colonies depended on the mobilization and control of unfree labour because her own economy, which was both archaic and on the verge of bankruptcy, lacked the capacity to export the fixed capital necessary for development. An 1899 government commission, whose task it was to analyse the prospects for development in Angola and Mozambique, had been unequivocal on this last point: We need native labour, we need it in order to better the conditions of these labourers, we need it for the economy of Europe and for the progress of Africa. Our tropical Africa will not grow without the Africans. The capital needed to exploit it, and it so needs to be exploited, lies in the procurement of labour for exploitation. Abun› dant, cheap, solid labour ... and this given the circumstances, will never be supplied by European immigrants. 64 The state had also introduced a series of tax laws designed to force many African agriculturalists off their land and create the beginnings of a semi-proletariat. While the tax laws did provide the colonial administra› tion with a new source of revenue, they failed to generate a cheap labour force on the scale anticipated by the colonial regime. Many peasants were able to circumvent the labour requirement by cultivating new or additional cash crops to pay their taxes. Others in Mozambique opted to work in the mines and plantations of neighbouring South Africa and Rhodesia at wages that were 200-300% higher than those that the under-capitalized Portuguese firms and planters offered."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.625, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Finally, whatever economic growth was achieved during the colonial period was done at a phenomenal and unjustifiable cost to the African - what with forced labour, migrant labour (which, says Davidson, 'probably did more to dismantle pre-colonial cultures and economies than most other aspects of the colonial experience put together'),$^{30}$ compulsory cultivation of certain crops, compulsory seizure of land, forced movements of popu› lations with the consequential dislocation of family life, the pass system, the high mortality rate in the mines and on the plantations, the brutality with which African resistance and protest movements generated by these measures were suppressed, etc. Above all, the monetary policies pursued by the colonial powers towards their colonies - tying their currencies to those of the colonial powers, introducing tariffs and keeping all foreign exchange earnings in the metropolitan capitals - while ensuring stable and fully convertible currencies, led to the freezing of colonial assets in the metropolitan capitals instead of their being realized and invested in the colonies. The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview', 'content': 'Despite the distance separating them and the diversity of their peoples and economies, the colonial societies of Angola and Mozambique shared more in common with each other than with their immediate neighbours. The specific character of Portuguese colonialism and, to a measure, the popular opposition which it generated, stem from four sets of factors the initial weakness of the colonial state, the progressively authoritarian nature of the colonial regime, the lack of Portuguese capital and a con› comitant dependence upon forced labour and the policy of assimilation.\nBy the eve of the First World War appreciable areas of both Angola and Mozambique remained outside Lisbon\'s effective control. Whereas the colonial administration was well entrenched in the coastal urban en› claves such as Luanda, Benguela, Beira and Lourenço Marques and their hinterlands, throughout vast interior regions the colonial presence was nominal and often depended on an alliance with local chiefs and African police whose loyalty was problematical.\nIn Angola, for example, as late as 1914, the Ovambo in the south remained effectively independent while revolts smouldered in the adjacent region of Ganguela until 1917 and the Lunda homelands of Quioco were only occupied in 1920. To the north opposition in the Congo region con› tinued until 1915 while Dembo insurgents defied the colonial state until 1918. 62 Portugal\'s position in Mozambique was only slightly better. Several northern sultanates and Yao chieftaincies had effectively defied the colonial regime until 1914 and the Makonde highlands remained outside the sphere of colonial rule as late as 1921. Moreover, during the First World War when German forces from neighbouring Tanganyika invaded northern Mozambique, they were greeted as liberators by a number of Makua chieftaincies which had suffered under the extremely harsh rule of the Niassa Company. Even in the southern half of the colony, where the colonial state was most firmly entrenched, officials feared a massive uprising (see Fig. 27.2).""', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.605, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Angola', 'content': ""Regarded as nonentities by the Europeans, subject to corporal punishment, and sometimes to arbitrary and venal treatment at the hands of the colonial authorities, to the demands of labour-recruiters and the collusion between government officials and resident Portuguese, Africans became outcasts in their own countries. They did, however, have several means of escaping the pressures that were brought to bear on them.\nThe first form of resistance consisted of taking up arms, but this was steadily abandoned from the end of the First World War since it was ultimately and hopelessly doomed to failure. There were fewer and fewer leaders, most weapons had been confiscated and gunpowder was, with a few exceptions, no longer available on the open market. The second alternative was to go into hiding. When the situation became intolerable, entire villages abandoned their fields and moved to areas furthest from the reach of the colonial authorities. Peasant flight was particularly common in the northern and eastern regions which remained effectively outside Lisbon's control. Such withdrawal could go on for years without being detected.\nThe third solution was even more radical for it was to all intents and purposes final. There is widespread evidence of massive clandestine emigration into the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia and even South West Africa. Often members of the rural population travelled great distances through harsh terrain with young children on their backs to free themselves from the tyranny of Portuguese colonial rule. If they were caught by the colonial authorities or the local African police, the men were beaten and imprisoned and the women sexually abused.\nThe fourth type of resistance to colonial rule were the religious or messianic cults founded by Africans in reaction to the colonial religion.

The limit was reduced to 10% in the middle of the decade because of the drying-up of the labour pool; but in general the official quota was very considerably exceeded.$^{20}$ In the Portuguese colonies, a subtle distinction was established between 'penal labour' reserved for convicts, and the labour - 'a moral and social obligation' - of men between 14 and 60 years of age, for at least six months per year.$^{21}$ The state was 'to have no scruples about obliging and if necessary forcing the Negro savages of Africa to work, that is, to improve themselves through labour in order to improve their means of existence, to civilize themselves'. 22 The plague of recruiters was particularly prevalent in the Congo, where the state delegated its powers of recruiting to companies such as the Bourse du Travail du Katanga (BTK) a private agency recruiting for the mines in the rural zones.

Events certainly played their part, and the military setbacks inflicted on the Portuguese by the Africans go some way towards explaining the ebb of colonial occupation during the period 1862-72. Personalities also influenced developments; certain governors were associ› ated with an aggressive policy of maximum occupation, others with a retreat to coastal bases. However, these factors do not assume their real significance unless they are placed in the context of world economic developments, particularly in so far as they affected the Portuguese economy. Indeed, Portuguese imperialism did not escape the general rules of colonial expansion in the nineteenth century. 19 The determination of the protectionists to ensure that Portugal and its colonies were united in an economic system independent of the great industrial powers was reflected in the first attempts to set up a white colony in the south of Angola, beginning on the coast at Moçâmedes, and at Huila in the Nyaneka country. The spirit of conquest was still uppermost in the 1850s, with sustained Portuguese efforts to occupy territory and eliminate competition from African traders, in particular the Imbangala and the Kongo. Not until i860 or thereabouts, following some years of thriving trade, was a turning-point reached, with the Portuguese increasingly adopt› ing a policy of withdrawal. From 1862 to 1875, the colonial power continued to retreat, suffering a series of military defeats at Cassanga in 1862, and in the Dembo country in 1871-2, which the government at Luanda did not seek to avenge. By the early 1870s the withdrawal was complete. The colonial power in Angola had fallen back to the coast, and Africans were rapidly gaining control of trade in the sertào. Silva Porto, the leading sertanejo of the BiØ area, lost his entire fortune in this period under the pressure of competition from the Ovimbundu traders.

Moreover, as members of a nascent colonial bourgeoisie, they had very different class interests which often placed them at odds with their less privileged counterparts and precluded a more radical critique of colonial-capitalism. Intense rivalries between mulatto and African segments of the colonial elite further reduced the influence of Gremio Africano and helped precipitate its demise. 109 By the early 1930s these animosities had grown progressively worse providing the colonial regime with an opportunity to shatter the last vestiges of unity. Appealing to the discontent of the African membership, state officials convinced several of them to break away and organize the Institutio Negrophilio in 1932. As an additional incentive, the colonial administration provided office space, furniture, books and generous funding while a prominent Portuguese businessman, Paulo Gil dos Santos, offered several leaders of the new organization employment as labour recruiters.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 161, 'article_title': 'NATAL.', 'full_section_title': 'NATAL.', 'last_edit_date': '03-07-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_05_1863', 'content': ""The conduct of the rascally Portuguese in the matter of the trading cutter Agnes, up King George's River, Delagoa Bay, has greatly irritated our mercantile people here. For all practical purposes, Natal may now be considered the representative of European civilization on the South-east Coast of Africa. All that the Portuguese have ever done upon the coast is, after having exhausted the coast population, to demoralise and depopulate the interior. They are now, as they have always been, and always will be, while they can find a purchase for their horrid merchandise—*Slave Traders.* There must be a change, and that speedily. The growing enterprise of this colony will not allow itself to be kept in check, and excluded from the rich commerce of the interior of the continent *through its natural channels, the rivers,* merely because the Portuguese have established a slave-trade authority on the coast. The sooner Her Majesty's Government comes to some understanding with the Portuguese for the freedom of commerce on the eastern rivers the better—if not, there will be far more serious collision between the Portuguese and our people than have yet taken place. The Zambesi Mission, too, which might have done great good, will certainly have to decamp in a very short time, if what we hear from home be true. You have told me that the Government will not continue the 5,000l. a-year for the Zambesi expedition any longer. Well, all I can say is, that if it cuts that off, it is bound, in justice to the Oxford and Cambridge Mission, to do something to secure them not only free access by the river, but entire protection as regards the slavetraders, and their infamous agents, natives and others. All the evildoing in the country they are the cause of, and they ought to be held responsible for it, and made to pay heavily. The proper way for the British Government, according to my mind, is to make the Portuguese domination on the East Coast so expensive for Portugal, that she may be only too glad to get rid of it. Then we shall get quit of another of the world's great nuisances—the presence of the Portuguese on the coast.\n\nWe have every prospect of good harvests this year. The coffee trees are represented as being borne down by the weight of berries on them. And the sugar crop will no doubt be large.

Some seed of the Latakia tobacco, introduced by a Mr. Robinson, in September last, has not only germinated, but thrown out plants of the greatest luxuriance, quite overgrowing the other varieties planted in the Botanic Gardens.

It has always been a part of our theory, and our strong conviction, that gems abound in the upper portion of the rivers of Equatorial West Africa. We have more than once in past years endeavoured privately to stimulate educated West Africans to the promotion of a search for diamonds and other precious stones in those rivers; and although those endeavours had not hitherto been crowned with any success, or led to any search being made, we were always prepared to hear of some commencement of discovery. It could not well be otherwise, considering the views we entertain as to the rapidly approaching end of the present dispensation. It seems to us only natural, and according to an appointed Divine order, that the earth should now make to man a full revelation of her long-concealed treasures. We never looked upon the gold discoveries of California and Australia as isolated facts, but merely as early links in a great chain of facts. Those who have read our ""Course of Divine Love""* may perhaps remember that, alluding to the accelerated action of ""Time"" in preparing for a great mundane catastrophe, we wrote (in the last chapter of that work, vol. ii. p. 345), ""One day he stirs up the sands of California; on the morrow is he amid the wealth of Australia, and his wings are spread toward Africa. Another day, gold may seem too poor, and he may descend upon the home of the diamond—alight in the treasure-house of earth\'s most beauteous gems."" Since then the gold and diamond discoveries of Southern Africa have been made; discoveries which we look upon as merely so far touching a portion of the fringe of some vast treasures; and now, while a chain of unpremeditated and unwished-for operations seems to be leading to an opening up to the world of the immense golden stores of the Kong Mountains, another seeming accident directs attention to Western Africa\'s Equatorial rivers, as being able to furnish fresh supplies of those precious stones, which have always been objects of the admiration and desire of mankind. The discovery of which we have received notice seems to have been made about ninety miles from the mouth of the River Congo; and this being so near the Portuguese settlements on the West Coast, we presume the first rush of searchers will be from among the African Portuguese there. We could have wished it to be otherwise. We have no faith in Portuguese action anywhere out of Portugal—and least of all in Africa, whether East or West; nor, should the first discovery be followed by others of importance, do we for one moment believe that the Portuguese would within a short period continue to be the chief explorers. There are at this time in the Congo River, commercial representatives of England, Holland, Germany, and France; and we do not believe that these would remain mere passive spectators of Portuguese enterprise. Rumour has more than once asserted that the great African explorer, of whom Great Britain is so proud, Dr. Livingstone, is in the countries of the Upper Congo, and may be expected on the West Coast by that river, at present also the scene of operations of two other exploring parties. We shall watch with great interest the course of future events on and in the countries bordering on that great river, which, since the final suppression of the foreign slave trade there, not above six or eight years ago, have made most wondrous strides in legitimate trade and commerce.'}, {'id': 4616, 'article_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.', 'full_section_title': 'IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1883#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_05_1883', 'content': 'Mr. Jacob Bright moved: ""That, in the interests of civilization and commerce in South-west Africa, this House is of opinion that no Treaty should be made by Her Majesty\'s Government that would sanction the annexation by any Power of territories on or adjacent to the Congo, or that would interfere with the freedom hitherto enjoyed by all civilizing and commercial agencies at work in those regions."" This he considered to be a most important subject, because the Congo was a river which for 166 miles from the coast was navigable for ocean-going vessels, and flowed through a populous country, of extraordinary fertility. Under the native government there was a freedom for trade which was not to be found in almost any other spot upon the globe. He would not undertake to say that there was no slavery in the country, but there was no such thing as the export of slaves from the Congo; and, at all events, neither missionary, traveller, nor merchant had any complaint to make of the native rule. Last week there was presented to Parliament a correspondence between Her Majesty\'s Government and the Government of Portugal, extending from 1845 to 1877, and no mention was made of this question of annexation till the last year, 1877, when there were complaints of some outrages having taken place. He understood Lord Granville to express the opinion that some authority should be established there other than that which now existed, by which better order might be maintained. It, however, should be an authority in which the native population should have confidence, and which the traders generally could respect. The information they had with respect to the question was very vague, but so far as he could make out, the Government proposed to make a Treaty with Portugal, and, if that Treaty were satisfactory to them, then the Portuguese might annex this large and important territory. By that Treaty the Government proposed to secure freedom of trade and religion, and would require guarantees with regard to the suppression of the slave-trade. Every one connected with the Congo country was in arms against this proposed Treaty. No doubt the Government would insist on Portugal giving this country moderate duties, not only in the Congo, but throughout its South African possessions; but he should like the Under Foreign Secretary to say what he considered to be moderate duties at such a place. In a country like the Congo, which had no duties and no Custom House, and where trade was absolutely free, traders might not, perhaps, call those moderate duties which the Foreign Office might consider such. (Hear, hear.) For example, in Mozambique there were duties of 10 per cent., and on many important articles they were as high as 25 or 35 per cent.; while in Zanzibar, which was under native government, eight or ten times more trade was done than in the great country of Mozambique. This did not promise that it would be very wise to upset the native rule on the Congo and substitute that of the Portuguese. In the Portuguese settlement of Angola, also on the West Coast of South Africa, the duties were excessive. There were considerable export duties and differential duties in favour of Portugal, and other disadvantages. He was prepared to admit that if they had a Treaty removing all those grievances, and placing them on an equal footing with the Portuguese, there would be some gain; but those who knew the Congo and the action of Portugal in South Africa, said there was no possible Treaty that would induce them willingly to admit the Portuguese on another yard of African territory. Even although there were no duties, the Portuguese had various methods of embarrassing and making trade impossible. Portuguese officials were an inferior and ignorant class of men. They were badly and irregularly paid, and, therefore, they became corrupt generally, and made exactions upon the inhabitants of the country in order to live. Again, no Treaty could interfere with the internal taxation, which nevertheless could be made so as to destroy and paralyse trade. In Angola there was an income tax of 10 per cent., a property tax of 10 per cent., a house duty of 6 per cent., a duty on the transfer of property of 6 per cent., and, therefore, English trade would be paralysed by a state of things like this. The Congo was navigable, but the Portuguese Government had placed the whole navigation in the hands of one firm, who charged 40s. or 50s. to carry goods 200 miles. It would be difficult to express the anxiety which this matter excited in the mercantile mind of the country. If this Treaty took place, and if the Portuguese troops were landed, there was not a factory or business house that would not place itself in a state of defence. Such would be the irritation of the natives against the Portuguese that they would treat every white man as an enemy, and do all in their power to destroy the property of the Europeans.

There must, he said, be many present who knew pretty well the outlines of the question. The Congo was the second river in Africa. For 115 miles from its mouth there was a magnificent waterway on which ocean steamers might ply: then they came to some barriers, but after these were passed, as they could be by road, there was uninterrupted navigation for 1,000 miles. The Congo territory on both banks of the stream was absolutely free to commerce. Portugal wished to annex this territory. A despatch by the Portuguese Government to their representatives abroad had been sent out during the last few days on this question. That despatch originated from the fact that the International Law Institute, in Munich, passed a vote recommending that this Congo region should be neutralized; should, in fact, be kept for all nations, and that nobody should have special jurisdiction over it. He believed that everybody in this country who knew anything about the question would support the International Law Institute of Munich in the vote they passed. The despatch of the Portuguese Government endeavoured to prove that Portugal had a legal right to the territory; that the character of Portugal in regard to the possession of African colonies was a good character; and, finally, it was declared that the jurisdiction of some civilized power was necessary in the Congo region. Now the British Government had for the last fifty years denied that Portugal had a right to this territory, and had exercised its influence to prevent her getting possession of it. Almost every Cabinet that had been in office, of whatever complexion or party, had taken that position. They did not deny that Portugal discovered the country, but they affirmed—and he believed it was indisputable—that for many generations Portugal had had no connection with it, and had, therefore, forfeited whatever rights the discovery may have given her. The most powerful proof that could possibly be adduced to show that Portugal had had no connection with the Congo, and had exercised no influence there, was the fact that for some time there had been a growing trade in the territory—a trade carried on by the Dutch, the Germans, the English, and the French—a trade which was of considerable importance to the manufactures of this country. If Portugal had had any influence in this Congo territory there would have been no trade. Wherever Portugal went in Africa she killed trade and made commerce absolutely impossible. With regard to legal rights, it was shown in the debate in the House of Commons that we had recognized the authority of a considerable number of chiefs on both banks of the Congo, and made treaties with them, and how should we look if we now recognized somebody else to go and crush these men out of existence? Speaking of the pleas raised by Portugal in support of her contention, that her alleged rights over this territory had been largely accepted by Europe, Mr. Bright said that one was this: That in 1877 a great crime was committed in the Congo country, some thirty negroes being barbarously murdered, and the British Consul in Angola, one of the Portuguese provinces in Africa, appealed to the Portuguese Governor of this province to punish the criminals, an appeal he would not have made unless Portuguese authority was recognized. But the criminals were Portuguese—with the exception of one man, who was a British subject, and a native of St. Helena—and it was not so remarkable, therefore, that the British Consul should have asked the Portuguese Consul to punish them. In any event, isolated cases such as this could not reverse the judgment which the whole history of the relations, or the want of relations, between Portugal and the Congo had led us to form. Then, Portugal undertook in the dispatch to show that her character in her African possessions was a good character. During the debate in the House of Commons he submitted this point to a very close inquiry, showing what her colonies were, and what her influence had been in them. The picture he drew was a most unfavourable one to Portugal, but it was a true one. One of his authorities was a Portuguese, M. Monteiro, a well-known writer and a very able man. Another was a gentleman whom the Times quoted the other day, Lord Mayo, who had travelled throughout these districts, and knew them well. After that debate he received, he could not say how many, letters and newspapers from Lisbon and some other parts of Portugal, every one of which was abusive of him; they attacked him as if he had done something which no honourable man could have done. But there was not one of these letters or newspapers which undertook to refute anything he had said.'}, {'id': 4738, 'article_title': 'Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P., on the Congo Question', 'full_section_title': 'Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P., on the Congo Question', 'last_edit_date': '11-10-1883', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1883#article-6', 'issue_date': '01_12_1883', 'content': '\n\n(Hear, hear.) Whether they spoke to merchants, to travellers, to scientific men, to explorers, or anybody who had ever had relations with the Congo, they would not find one who regarded with anything but aversion the possibility of Portugal being planted in that most important region. Finally, as he had said, the Portuguese Government urged in this dispatch that there should be some civilized jurisdiction on the banks of the Congo. Well, he would not say that a civilized jurisdiction, in which the natives could have confidence, in which the merchants could have confidence, and which would produce a better state of things than now existed—he would not say that such a jurisdiction might not be desirable. It ought to be within the capacity of England and the other powers of Europe to establish such a jurisdiction if it was necessary. But the jurisdiction of Portugal would not be such a jurisdiction as he had described. In the very case he had spoken of in which the British Consul asked the Portuguese Governor to punish the murderers of the thirty negroes, after an inquiry had been held, the Consul had a belief that it was altogether unsatisfactory, and that it was not a real inquiry. And it would be easy to show that in the Portuguese Colonies of Africa deeds probably as horrible—certainly many very dreadful deeds—were perpetrated which did not meet with any adequate punishment. Some newspapers, the Times for instance—and he thought also the Manchester Guardian, the other day—leaned somewhat to the view that on some terms or other Portugal might perhaps be allowed to go to this region. What did the merchants say? They said, We would not have Portugal on any terms; we do not trust her; no kind of bargain which she might make with us would give us any kind of security. In the despatch he had spoken of, Portugal said, Of course if we go to the Congo it will be an exception; we won’t establish the tariffs, and we won’t do there as in other colonies. That was very much like an admission that her other colonies were not in a very satisfactory state. She said that if she went to the Congo her tariff should not exceed the lowest tariff that existed in any part of the world. He scarcely knew where the lowest tariff existed, but he supposed it was in Turkey. If Portugal said, We will never have a higher tariff than five per cent., or seven or eight per cent., that would give no kind of security to the merchants of these various countries. They might bind Portugal to that agreement, but what were they to do with regard to her internal government, her internal taxation, with regard to the wonderful capacity she had of obstructing and delaying every kind of commercial proceeding, however small? (Hear, hear.) The Portuguese Government said not only that they would have very low duties, but that the navigation of the river should be absolutely free. But unless the banks of a river were free, how could the river be said to be free? (Hear, hear.) Although there was considerable commerce on the Congo, it was not so great as to induce ocean steamers to go from the sea up the 115 miles of river on which they could ply without difficulty if they chose to do so. Goods were unloaded and put upon smaller vessels to go up the stream. If Portugal was planted on the Congo, with all her machinery of custom houses, and all her genius for delay, what would become of the trade represented by the goods that would have to be unloaded and reloaded in Portuguese possessions? Men who talked glibly about putting Portugal on the banks of the Congo and abolishing the sway of the native chiefs, should remember the important fact of the difference betwixt the two provinces of Zanzibar and Mozambique. Mozambique was a great province on the eastern coast of Africa, and alongside of it was Zanzibar. Zanzibar, which was under native rule, had a trade eight or ten times as large as Mozambique, which was a province of Portugal. (Hear, hear.) The British Government for half a century had exercised an influence which had kept the Congo region free, and made it impossible for Portugal to go there. He contended that the influence which had done this in the past might do it in the future; and he should have very little faith in, or admiration for, the statesmanship of England or the statesmanship of Europe, if it allowed a region so important now and so promising for the future to be blighted by passing into the possession of such a power as Portugal.

As for the native, who had certainly been high-handed, I am personally acquainted with him, and have never previously known him to place himself in the wrong. I would rather live, as I have lived, under the protection of Mongovo Mazunga than of any official the King of Portugal can appoint. In reference, however, to the occurrence, I may say that there has been no second interference of the Commissioner in behalf of the whites; petty disputes arise as of old between traders and natives, and are settled by them without any aid from the authorities.

Let an International Board of Control be established to settle all disputes where their interference was desirable; guarantee the neutrality of the river and its territories; and empower the Board to summon, if requisite, the aid of any of the gunboats stationed on the coast.

To the southward of Loando the Portuguese claim the coast-line as far south as Cape Frio, a distance of about 580 miles. The territory untraced in this area, which extends across a considerable portion of the Dark Continent, is the richest and most fertile on the West Coast of Africa. In the hands of a really civilized and enterprising European Power it would be capable of great things; in the possession of Portugal it advances but little. The Portuguese do not possess sufficient capital to work and develop it even if they had the enterprise to do so, which they most decidedly have not, and their jealousy of foreigners, which takes the form of heavy protective duties on foreign trade, prevents, to a great extent, the opening out of the country by foreigners. In my last letter I mentioned the great river Coanza, which throws itself into the sea a little to the southward of St. Paul de Loando. This river is at present being worked by an English firm, which has a house at Lisbon, and manages by this means to in some measure elude the heavy duties levelled against foreigners: its goods have, however, to pass through Portugal, which, though it lessens the duties, materially increases the freight; the transhipping, rail charges, and re-shipping being heavy items. I was unable to ascend this river, as time did not permit, but I was informed, on reliable authority, that it is capable of being the highway of a vast trade, and that it passes through a country unsurpassed in beauty, wealth, and fertility by any other in Africa. Proceeding a little further down the coast, one arrives at the town of St. Philip de Benguela, a place of great importance in the days when slavery was in full vigour in these parts, but now rapidly falling into decay. Ruined buildings and roofless churches tell of better days, or at least of days when wealth was more abundant, however little we can approve of the means by which it was obtained. Benguela, as it is usually termed for brevity's sake, is an extremely unhealthy place, but that is a fact that can scarcely be wondered at. It does not at present pay the Portuguese Government in a pecuniary sense, mainly because the harbour is bad or has become bad by neglect, and nothing is done in the town to enforce a compliance with even the ordinary decencies of life, much less the most trivial sanitary laws. If the harbour were dredged, and capital could find its way into this place, there does not appear to me to be any reason why Benguela should not achieve something of its former importance."", 'last_edit_date': '1885-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P., on the Congo Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': '(Hear, hear.)

The officers of Her Majesty\'s squadron were instructed to inform the chiefs that England did not recognize the sovereignty of Portugal; that the limit of her colony was Ambriz, north of which she had no right to levy duties. From that town north to Cape Lopez Gonsalvez, up to 1870, the English senior officer of the Southern division was appealed to by people of all nations when difficulties arose with the natives, which were usually settled by an amicable ‘palaver.’ Sometimes force had to be resorted to. To take one instance, the Dutch at Banana had a disagreement with the chiefs of Porta da Zinha, and their factory there was threatened with an attack. They represented the case to me. We ran up the River Congo with one of their vessels in tow, lay with our guns covering their factory, and kept a watch at their quarters for forty-eight hours. The goods were shipped, and their *employés* brought off in safety. But before we were a gun-shot distant on return down the river, the natives rushed in, and the factory was in flames. Life and much property was saved, and not a shot was fired. Instances might be multiplied without end to prove that England supplied the police of the river, and that in squabbles between white men and natives, and even between rival factories, the British man-of-war was constantly appealed to. Their doctors, without payment, did their best for Hamburghers, Portuguese, or English, and their crews were ever ready to help a vessel of any nation in difficulty or distress. I grant the willingness of the Portuguese to assist, but they were seldom there, and they had nothing like sufficient force. Portugal may have indisputable rights of sovereignty, but prior to 1870 she certainly did not, or simply could not, exercise those rights. The foreign slave-trade in the territory claimed by Portugal may be said to have come to an end in 1865. Prior to that time, so far from the authorities at St. Paul de Loanda having encouraged legitimate trade, they seemed to do what they could to prevent it. And who can wonder? They wished to force that trade to pass through their own custom-houses to pay something to the State, and as much as possible to the officers...', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the Berlin Conference', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following letter has been addressed to Lord Granville by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce with reference to the alleged claims of Portugal to possessions on the Congo: ""Authentic information has reached this Chamber that the Government of Portugal is again bringing forward its former pretensions to hold and exercise authority over both banks of the Congo and over the adjacent territories, and that this action on her part is an impediment to the conclusion of the deliberations of the Berlin Conference.

Senhor de Vasconcellos adverted to the grave charges made against Portugal in this respect by Commander Cameron at the sitting of the Paris Geographical Society, and by Lieutenant Young in addressing the Chamber of Commerce at Capetown. The speaker proceeded to declare that although the British Government was not responsible for these accusations, Portugal was bound to protest against them. He concluded by pointing out the services rendered by Portugal in the abolition of slavery, and dwelt in eloquent terms upon all that had been achieved by the Portuguese in Africa.—The Colonial Minister, in reply, said that the question had been placed on its proper ground by Senhor de Vasconcellos. He concurred with him in doing justice to England and the English Government, but added that it was the duty of the Portuguese Government to contradict false information furnished by travellers. The Minister, however, none the less appreciated the services of Commander Cameron in the cause of science. He announced, in conclusion, that he would to-morrow communicate documents to the House proving that the services rendered by Portugal in the abolition of slavery were acknowledged by the British Government.—Several speakers who followed the Minister animadverted in severe terms upon the charges of corruption against the Portuguese officials on the East Coast made by Lieutenant Young. The galleries of the House were very crowded, as the debate had been anticipated with the greatest interest.\n\nLisbon, Feb. 18.—After a long debate the Chamber of Deputies has unanimously voted a resolution approving the explanations of the Ministers rebutting the charges of Commander Cameron and Lieutenant Young.
