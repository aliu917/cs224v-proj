120,"Colonial Africa was marked by complex racial dynamics and cultural tensions, as European settlers and officials wielded significant power, often leading to legal ambiguities, social conflicts, and efforts to control diverse populations through policies like the Lagos Alien Children Registration Ordinance.","The observations from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively underscore the complex racial dynamics and cultural tensions that characterized colonial Africa. The textbook provides substantial evidence of a racial hierarchy imposed by European settlers and officials, placing Europeans at the top and Africans at the bottom, which led to social conflicts and legal ambiguities. It highlights the monopolization of economic opportunities and fertile lands by European and Asian settlers in regions like East and Central Africa, resulting in the marginalization of African populations. The paternalistic attitudes of European colonial administrators, who believed in their cultural and racial superiority, further exacerbated these tensions through indirect rule and other policies. However, the textbook does not specifically mention the Lagos Alien Children Registration Ordinance. In contrast, The African Times articles focus on specific incidents and regulations, such as the Lagos Alien Children Registration Ordinance, which exemplifies efforts to control diverse populations. The articles also detail incidents of violence and legal injustices, like the horse-whipping of Mr. Cole by Europeans and the lenient punishment for a government official who flogged natives, highlighting the significant power wielded by European settlers and officials. While the articles do not provide a comprehensive overview of colonial policies across Africa, they vividly illustrate the racial dynamics and power imbalances through specific examples. Together, these sources paint a detailed picture of the racial and cultural complexities in colonial Africa, aligning with the claim while highlighting different aspects of the historical context.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial Africa was marked by complex racial dynamics and cultural tensions.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism. For the Negroes in particular the theory postulated a degree of cultural barrenness which made it necessary and possible to explain their history and social evolution in terms of the Hamitic impact.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

This was the failure of the assimilationist or direct administration policy which was the vogue in the nineteenth century. Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Though there were European settlers in the North African states and in South Africa before the colonial era, there is no doubt that not only did the number of these people increase but European and Asiatic settlers were also introduced into East and Central Africa and parts of West Africa during the colonial days. As M. H. Y.

This is usually provided through a diffusion of the culture of the colonizer through education. Attainments within the educational system established for this purpose provide the yardsticks for raising a new group of elites among the colonized society. However, the diffusion of the imported culture of the colonizer almost invariably involves not only harmonious culture contacts, but also culture conflicts, which could find expression in violent reactions from the subject people. Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.742, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""This difference in time factor is important in any attempt to account for the differential impact of the forces of change on the different regions and countries of Africa. That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa. At the beginning of the period the continent's population was still sparse, at least by the standards of the Old World. More signifi› cantly it probably was not growing rapidly and evidenced a vulnerability to the kind of pressures, both internal and external, which were being increasingly applied. By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.) Elsewhere Europeans were beginning to exert control over Egypt and Tunisia, ruled some coastal populations in Senegal and the Gold Coast (now Ghana) and held such enclaves as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Lagos, Libreville and parts of Angola and Mozambique. By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2). The half century saw European medical science progressing from an ignorance of the cause of most of Africa's major diseases to an ability to contain or cure most of them; indeed the period ends just as the sulpha drugs were ushering in an era of chemotherapy of great significance for the continent. It also spans almost the whole railway-building age and a transition from a time when nearly all land transport was by human porterage to one where lorries were beginning to multiply on a growing network of dusty or muddy roads."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A basis for the future', 'content': 'By 1935 Africa had successfully withstood the demographic shock of European colonization. Its births now far exceeded its deaths, and in many parts of the continent, especially in the growing towns, life was no longer very precarious. Admittedly its death rates were still very high - in the continent as a whole the death rate was probably still well over 30 per thousand and the expectation of life at birth barely more than 30 years but it was the diseases of tropical Africa, more than any other factor, which had held the invader largely at bay and prevented Africa from becoming another Latin America. Even as it was, the white population of the continent had increased thirty times from 25000 in 1800, found mostly in the Cape, to three-quarters of a million in 1880, of whom five-sixths were in South Africa, Algeria and Egypt. By 1935 it had multiplied again by five to 3.75 million, of whom half were in South Africa, a quarter in Algeria and a further fifth in the rest of North Africa. During the same period, Asians (almost entirely Indians except for a few small Chinese communities of which the largest was on the Rand) increased from about 50000 to over a third of a million of whom over two-thirds were in South Africa. Change was coming but few perceived it clearly as is evident from a serious European appraisal of the racial numbers in Algeria in the 1920s: \'Most Frenchmen in Africa had little to fear of there ever being another serious effort to overthrow authority; for, as they point out, there are over eight hundred thousand Europeans to five and a half million natives who have little cohesion and could not do much more than indulge in sporadic outbreaks."" 05 In 1935 Africa stood at the brink of rapid population growth, which would take its numbers - which had already grown according to our estimates from 120 million in 1880 to 165 million - to 200 million by the late 1940s, 300 million by the mid-1960s and inevitably to 400 million in the mid-1970s.

Our Teutonic clerk had strong religious and social convictions, a mixture of those of Father Noyes and Mrs. Besant; his proper sphere was New York or Chicago, but still his peculiar talents were not wasted even in Swampville.

But a dark cloud was hanging over our Teutonic swain, a danger from the north, which duly came in the shape of the highest official of this heaven-blessed but man-cursed colony. He was a man of some talent, especially for saving cheese-parings; despotic and stubborn, with a tireless flow of talk, you could not call it language; but gifted with a most roomy heart, a regular household heart, with not alone reception, dining, and bed rooms, but kitchens, scullery, and attics,—a heart that would receive into its airy rooms the whole female creation were it possible,—a model lodging-house heart. This specimen of British officialdom was known, ironically, as ""Valerian of the Open Hand."" He was not long resident in Swampville until he visited the official beauties, our gentle Amina among the rest; and it pleased his Mightiness, like the Turkish Satrap of romance, to cast his handkerchief at our Arcadian beauty, and he hereafter danced attendance on her at all official or civil reunions. Our Teutonic swain gradually got the cold shoulder; seaside or sylvan walks were neglected, at last ceased; the green-eyed monster entered into the soul of the poor clerk; he ceased to smile. At last, in despair, he waylaid his affinity on her evening walk, and madly swore at her for her heartlessness and treachery. Our nymph cried, and upbraided him as a coward, &c., for blaming her for fulfilling the natural laws of her creed, whereby she was attracted to the affinity with the strongest magnetism. After some polite remarks on both sides, they were reconciled. The swain continued to visit the nymph, and walked with her when Valerian was not around. A hollow truce subsisted. When gentle Amina went to the watering-place of Mary Magdalene\'s Point, the swain would follow her there, but would be dismissed just ere the advent of Valerian. Months thus passed over; but on one eventful night in Swampville, the swain was sitting, basking in the smiles of our nymph. Valerian enters. After saluting gentle Amina, he waited a decent period; then inquired, was the swain not going to leave? The Teuton blood rose hot; he said, ""No!"" Valerian inquired of our nymph, did she wish the company of ""this man""? Gentle Amina replied, ""I think he had better go."" Valerian orders Restina out, who goes reluctantly. Valerian follows him into the yard; compliments are exchanged; Valerian would like to knock the soul out of him; Restina would like to start a grave yard, and make Valerian occupier of the first corner lot; they proceed to spar, but neither are ""much on the shoulder""; they soon tire; Valerian then calls for the police, and Restina, fearing arrest for assault of so powerful a man, skedaddles, and Valerian of the Open Hand remains in possession of the field of battle.'}]","[{'document_title': 'How to Conciliate Natives, Etc., in a New Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## HOW TO CONCILIATE NATIVES, ETC., IN A NEW COLONY.\n\nThe following is an abridged account of _an affair_ that came off lately at Lagos.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them.

Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa.

He declared he never knew a colony founded on scientific geography; and cited the Congo as an example of how to do it, pointing with pride to the forty steamers and 800 white men where there was not one ten years ago, urged the importance of railways and steamers, and prophesied that some day people will live in Africa as they now do in India, Brazil, Mexico, and Chili.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile.

It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands.

Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Liberia"", 'content': ""Side by side with European encroachments, Liberia faced serious internal economic and social problems.

Up to 1914 most of the commissioners were Americo-Liberian or educated indigenous Liberian military officers. The administration was largely oppressive and corrupt. Most of the district commissioners, their aides, and troops, being poorly and irregularly paid, and seldom supervised from Monrovia, lived off their districts by extorting food, labour for their private farms, and excessive fines and taxes (above the official one dollar poll-tax on adult males, and labour required for public buildings and roads). 65 Not surprisingly, the indigenous Africans resisted not only their military subjugation to Liberian government authority - just as Africans elsewhere resisted subjugation to European rule - but also the excesses of the Liberian administration. Until subjugated by the Liberian militia, the Liberian Frontier Force and American naval ships, the Kru resisted intermittently, and particularly in 1915-16; the Grebo resisted in 1910; the Kissi in 1913; the Kpele and Bandi, 1911-14; the Gio and Mano, 1913-18; the Gbolobo Grebo, 1916-18; the Gola and Bandi, 1918-19; the Joquelle Kpele, 1916-20; and the Sikon in 1921.

Foreign aid was meagre. Most Americo-Liberians preferred trade to agriculture and were seriously hurt by the worldwide depression of the late nineteenth century. By 1890 resident German, British and Dutch merchants dominated Liberia's external trade.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

These have remained in many areas and underlie some of the civil wars and rivalries that have occurred in some independent African states. The neglect of higher education and technical training also compelled some Africans who could afford to do so, to send their children to the metropolitan countries as well as to the United States, and it was such people who, partly from their varying experiences of racial discrimination and, even more important still, their deeper appreciation of the evil nature of the colonial system, became on their return, as will be shown in the next volume, the most bitter critics of the system and the leaders of the anti-colonial or nationalist movements.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly.

We do not know how his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor feels under such reproof, but no one can accuse our Natal fellow-citizens of a too patient endurance of wrong at the hands of ""those who are appointed to rule over them"":—'}, {'id': 178, 'article_title': 'NATAL.', 'full_section_title': 'NATAL.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-11', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'By the Cape Mail we have news from Natal to the 3rd April. Previous reports are confirmed as regards the harvest prospects in this most interesting and important colony. Never, it is said, has there before been such a growing season. Never before did the crops look so green, advanced, and promising in March and April. All this is owing to a steady succession of genial rainfalls. The crop of Sugar is expected to be very large. This is very important for the colony, because Natal sugar has now become a favourite in the Australian markets. Coffee, Cotton, and all other products, look most promising, and a generally good yield is anticipated. Cotton, Flax, and other textile fabrics, are occupying attention in the colony. The average yield of Sea Island cotton will, it is said, be about 400lbs. of ginned cotton per acre. It is also now affirmed that cotton planting and sugar planting may be carried on successfully together, because at the time when labour is most wanted in the cotton fields it is least needed in the cane fields. Several patches of cotton, of a few acres each, are to be seen this year. But unless the Kafirs take to labour in the cotton fields, the labour question will be the great difficulty. The Flax that has been experimentally grown has given abundant yield, and the quality is reported as ""very good."" Wool is to become the favourite product of the upper country. There are continual importations of Sheep from the Cape, and of Rams of good breed from Australia and England. Some Alpacas are also expected from Australia. It is thought they are peculiarly suited to the hill pastures of Natal, and will give value to some of the wild kloofs of the country. Coffee planting is making steady progress. Coffee pays remarkably well, and its cultivation is therefore certain to be increased.\n\nThe Colonial-office in Downing-street has disallowed the bill passed last session for raising the Governor\'s salary from 1,200l. to 3,000l. a-year.\n\n**Zambesi.**—An expedition on an extensive scale has left the Natal borders for the Zambesi. Waggons had been built specially for the purpose. The object is said to be sport. Other similar expeditions are likely to follow.

He offers land in this township of Oko-Tapa to our merchants, for trading purposes only, at 3l. per acre. We all approve of the attempt to establish this town, which, if successful, will lead to increased communications with the interior of Yoruba by other route than that of Abeokuta. But is not this very decree of a town opposite Epé, on British territory, a strong condemnation of Governor Freeman\'s expedition, in which so many lives were wantonly cast away? I look at it as being so, and think you will do the same.\n\nWe are trying further experiments in taxation, and I shall be\n**45**\n\ncurious to hear what you think about some of them. For instance, merchants who import and sell rum, &c., are to pay a licence of 50l. per annum; and all petty traders of every class a licence of 1l. per annum. Opinion is very much divided here on the subject. One result is certain, there will be no small importers of spirits.\n\nI will tell you why this has been done. We are creating a great many paid offices here—money must be had for them—and the magnificent rum and tobacco duties, which were to yield 20,000l. a-year, will now, it is thought, produce not more than 5,000l., because traders will be such asses! as to go to Porto Novo, where there are no duties, in preference to paying heavy ones here. So in order, if possible, to prevent their carrying on a spirit business both here and at Porto Novo, they are to be enticed to give up the latter by a new exaction of 50l. per annum in addition to the said duties! Funny inducement, is it not? It is a pity we are not educated up to the point at which we might be able fully to comprehend the masterly policy of our talented rulers.\n\nOur trading condition may be stated in three words—as we were. No arrangement yet with Abeokuta, and, in consequence, merchants suffering dreadfully.\n\nOne result of the friendly intercourse between the French Admiral, &c., and our Governor and merchants, mentioned in my last, is, that the boundaries of the respective French and English territories (for so they must now be called) around Porto Novo are likely to be at once settled.\n\nLieut.-Commander Moultrie has taken the command of H.M.\'s ship Handy.\n\nWe are anxious to know whether Mr. Freeman is to come out again as Governor. A memorial has been got up here in favour of Captain Glover as Governor, greatly, I believe, to the captain\'s regret.

But his successors undid what he had done, his own brother included.\n\nYou will remember that Lieutenant Sealer, when he was Acting Chief Civil Commandant, went up hither to settle the palavers which arose in consequence of the people's superstition about the small-pox, which he did in a very clever way.

There is some talk of the merchants furnishing subsistence, but it would then remain to be seen whether they could or would meet all just demands, or continue willingly to do so should the affair be a protracted one.

Mr. Oakes, P.M.O. of the 2nd West India Regiment, summoned Mr. W. C. Finlason for twelve guineas for medical visits. Mr. Finlason pleaded that he was only indebted six guineas. Captain Hall, 2nd West India Regiment also, sat as stipendiary magistrate. He came into court arm-in-arm with his friend Mr. Oakes, the plaintiff, who sat on the bench with him. Mr. Oakes stated his case, but called no witnesses. The defendant called evidence to establish that Mr. Oakes only attended him _five times._ The magistrate\'s examination of the witnesses, one in particular, was very severe. The defendant then addressed the Bench, and, among other things, said ""he knew how the case must end,"" upon which Captain Hall attacked him very violently, charging him with having imputed to him something dishonourable. The defendant apologised if he had said anything disrespectful, such not being his intention, and stated that what he meant was that Captain Hall must necessarily, after the evidence, decide in his (the defendant\'s) favour. The magistrate stopped him, saying ""he did not believe a word,"" and that, in a previous case, when the defendant was acting _as an advocate,_ he uttered a _gross falsehood_ to the chief justice. The defendant, considering himself insulted, sat down. On leaving the court, a few minutes after, in a great rage, as might naturally be expected, he asked a native gentleman, also an advocate in the courts, whether the latter did not consider that he had been grossly insulted, to which the reply was: ""Yes, he is a blackguard—a mean, low blackguard to take such an advantage of you,"" which met, of course, with acquiescence. Captain Hall, the magistrate, _was not then in court,_ but in the Fort; a bystander, however, carried to him information of what had been said. Accordingly, on the following Monday, Judge Hackett, sitting in the Supreme Court, called upon Mr. Finlason to explain, which he did, to the effect that whatever he might have said was "" _out of court_""—that he had received a most unwarranted and unprecedented insult from the Bench—hence was in a great rage out of court, and might possibly have made use of such words, for which, however, if he had so done, he was sorry, and hoped that Captain Hall would also make the _amende honorable_ to him.

Mr. Shaw went along with his Excellency, and some days after a meeting of the Legislative Council was called, at which of course President Huggins presided. Nothing of greater importance characterized this meeting than the rumour that somehow or other it was contemplated at the next meeting to propose that the expenses incurred by Mr. Shaw should be defrayed at the expense of the public. But this was enough. The rumour flew, and with its spread higher and higher rose the indignation of the people. If Governor Blackall had been here then, possibly he would have had a deputation, including every taxpayer in the colony, waiting upon him or obstructing the entrances at Fort Thornton. There was no mistaking the alarming seriousness and determination on almost every countenance of the great body of taxpayers. Pay who might, they were resolved, with every constitutional means in their power, to resist an imposition upon them of Mr. Shaw\'s most unjustifiably incurred expenses.

What is true of an individual is applicable to a nation, who are but assembled individuals; and when I contrast the desire we once felt to raise some memorial to our sailor prince, and the apathy in the completion of the work which we have too long delayed, I think that we have exhibited ill-regulated and badly-balanced minds. This distinguished Prince, following out the counsels of one of the greatest authorities of antiquity, has visited all regions of the earth, and wherever he went, by the frank and unassuming dignity of his manner, has won golden opinions from all classes of men. It is well known in England how dear he is to the heart of his royal mother; and when he escaped the assassin\'s bullet in Australia (a blessed fact to be engraven for all ages on our future memorials), the exclamation of his brother—England\'s future king—showed how dear he was to him: ""Oh, my God! poor Alfred; what will my poor mother say?""—sweet domestic words, showing how, in a palace, children reared after England\'s old fashion (a dear combination of head and heart) can exhibit the simple and unadorned virtues of the cottage. When the Prince, for the first time after the base attempt upon his life, appeared at the Crystal Palace in England, the whole immense audience rose, and the musical strains of fifty bands were drowned in the tumultuous music of the heart, poured forth by 50,000 enraptured beings.\n\nArt opens to us here at Sierra Leone a lasting power to exhibit our joy. The transient emotions of the heart pass away, however potent they may be, but in the painter and sculptor are reserved the power of fixity for all ages. To us the opportunity is not given to secure the services of the great historians of thought; but a graceful and classical column, rendered still more graceful by inscribing the simple record of the life of our sailor prince, we can at least command. Let us at least redeem the scandal and public scorn entailed by ex-Governor Blackall\'s mock exhibition, and let his imaginary tenants in buckram make way for a right royal Prince in the fullness of flesh and blood. I shall not abandon this deeply interesting question, and at a future, but not distant, period entering more into detail, I shall respectfully suggest the site for the memorial, the inscription it should bear, and the ceremonies which should be adopted when it is revealed to public view by one who so worthily represents the illustrious mother of the Prince in his rule over at length happy Africa.\n\nIn a subsequent communication I will inquire into some circumstances connected with the subscription raised for erecting this memorial, and show the disaster which resulted from the...\n[SEPTEMBER 23, 1869.]\n\n---'}, {'id': 2136, 'article_title': 'SMALL-POX AT CAPE COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'SMALL-POX AT CAPE COAST.', 'last_edit_date': '11-30-1871', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1872#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_01_1872', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—Dr. Mosse has responded to the article in the last _African Times_ treating on the introduction of small-pox into this place, and with reference to his reply, there are two matters to which I would particularly draw your attention.\n\n1st.

Two memorials or petitions by them appear in our present number. One is from the members of the Fanti Confederation who were arbitrarily imprisoned, and subsequently held to heavy bail by Mr. Salmon, Acting Administrator of the Gold Coast, without any charge whatever being formalised against them, or any measures being subsequently taken to bring them to trial, for any alleged offence whatever. The other is from the two Fynns (sen. and jun.), and Forson, who were arbitrarily thrust into prison on most groundless charges, and who were acquitted by unanimous verdict of an educated jury when brought to trial, although every possible effort was made by the Executive and judicial authorities to force a conviction. No sooner had the arbitrary and wrongful acts above alluded to been committed, than we made a claim for compensation to the innocent sufferers. Such petitions as have been now forwarded by the Governor-in-Chief, cannot with any show of justice be left unattended to by the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and if attended to, compensation must, we think, follow. We think this because the official acts and utterances of the Governor-in-Chief show that the continuous statement of facts lodged by us at the Colonial-office between December, 1871, and the date of Mr. Pope Hennessy's departure for the West Coast, had proved to Her Majesty's Government that the Local Executive and judicial authorities at Cape Coast had fallen into grievous error, both in their treatment of the elected officers of the Fanti Confederation and also in that of the two Mr. Fynns and Mr. Forson. No one can ever justly accuse us of a desire to squander or fritter away the revenues of the West African Settlements. We most assuredly would never have sent out to Cape Coast such a steamer as the Nellie, of which doomed craft we make mention elsewhere. The objects to be achieved by an enlightened Executive at the Gold Coast, whenever that protectorate may be blessed with one, are of such vital importance if its countries are to be guided on to civilization, and will require so much money, that we should be the last to make a stroke of the pen in favour of any expenditure for other purposes, not absolutely called for by the claims of justice and equity, and for indispensable Executive and judicial wants. When, therefore, we say that we think compensation must be awarded by Her Majesty's Government to persons so much wronged, knowing, as we but too well do, that such compensation must come out of the local, and not out of imperial revenue, we feel sure that our readers will understand how very strong our convictions are of what justice and equity demand in these cases.""}, {'id': 2394, 'article_title': ""Classpeter and Sawyer's Case"", 'full_section_title': ""Classpeter and Sawyer's Case"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_02_1873#article-10', 'issue_date': '28_02_1873', 'content': ""\n\nThis is what affects all natives of the interior. It is therefore they ask the Government to have the matter settled. The instructions given by Governor Pope Hennessy and Mr. Fowler were to induce the natives to open the roads, and that these two questions should be settled afterwards. In the meantime, if a woman came to Lagos, and her husband turned up, and she admitted him to be her husband, and that she was not a slave, and especially when she had borne him children, she should be sent back with her husband to save trouble; but if any slave came to Lagos he or she could not be sent back. In fact, even Capt. Glover used to send away wives with their husbands, after he returned from England in 1866, and so things went on smoothly; but later, when he had an object in view, he permitted his ragamuffin Ijayi and Yorubas friends to go and entice wives and slaves away, and took steamers into the rivers and creeks, to annoy the people, and make them the means of domestic slaves escaping from their masters. He must have known what all this would come to—destruction and ruin, as we see at this day. The King of Jebu and Government yielded to Governor Pope Hennessy's overtures, but between the 24th September and the 7th October last, Capt. Glover's party in Lagos used all the discharged V.R. Police as agencies for diffusing erroneous ideas among the Lagosians at Epe (who are their friends, and to whom Capt. Glover made large presents out of our revenue ere he was sent away), and making them instruments in telling the Jebus secretly that they have been deceived; that the Government will not carry out their promises; Turo used the Isheri people as instruments to sow suspicion in the hearts of the Egbas; that the Lagos Government are deceiving them, and that the Egbas should use their influence to persuade the Jebus to hold out and disbelieve any promises that had been made. Hence all the good that it was supposed had been done, has come to nothing. Notwithstanding these disappointments, we are not disheartened—we are doing our best. The enemies to peace and trade have done their worst to thwart our proceedings. Fancy, those erroneous statements of Mr. Charles Leigh Clare, of Manchester, were (at least, it is reasonable so to suppose) furnished to him through Capt. Glover by C. D. Turton (agent for Mr. Clare in Lagos), late Postmaster, who wrote them to assist Capt. Glover, so that he might be the Colonial Secretary, and J. H. Willoughby Tuvo, &c., have good employments. It happened that two women, wives of two Ikorodu men, were brought away to Lagos on the 28th July last; one of these had four children to her husband—the last child was on her back. The other woman had three children by her husband, but they died. The two husbands came after them the same day, and found out where they were. Next day, the women were taken to the Governor, and on inquiry they owned, that the two men are their husbands, and that they are their wives. King Docemo represented the matter too; and the Governor asked why they came away; they said on account of private family matters, which they related. The reasons were so frivolous that the Governor said they must go with their husbands; and they went with them.""}, {'id': 2882, 'article_title': 'The Primitive Methodist Day-School at Fernando Po', 'full_section_title': 'The Primitive Methodist Day-School at Fernando Po', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1875#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_06_1875', 'content': '\n\nbe aware that we are surrounded by about forty or fifty heathen towns, and our Society expecting to civilize the whole of them; so he could see that there is room for him if he could only climb from a semi-civilized to a civilized state. In conclusion, let me fulfill the design of my writing by giving the public some information respecting the above-named school, and that briefly. This school was formed in September, 1870, and on March, 1871, I was engaged as a school and missionary assistant. When I went to the school I met A. M. Savage, who was afterwards stabbed here and died at Cape Coast Castle. We both conducted the school until the two years\' examination mentioned by ""Progress,"" which he states makes the people glad. That examination took place a year and four months from the establishment of the school (and that was two years according to ""Progress\'s"" reckoning). After that examination, his Excellency of 1872 proclaimed that all the children in Santa Isabel must be sent to the Spanish day-school which he proposed to form, which, as far as every one did prove, was not satisfactory to the people here; but heavy fine and imprisonment were to be the penalty inflicted on any parent or parents refusing to send their children. The next day after the edict, myself and my late colleague were sent for from our school by the Governor (which was on the 10th of January, 1872); so we appeared. After paying the honour that was due to him, he said to us, ""Where are you from?"" We replied, ""Why did you undertake to conduct that school? It is for that you are brought before me, and I think you ought to be banished from this island for so doing."" We then cogently replied; after which he sent us over to the Judge, and his Honour, after a day\'s investigation, acquitted us, as no fault was found in us. Now, let me ask, where was ""Progress"" at this time? Why did not he show his love of progress by going to the Governor and advocating on behalf of the school? As our school hours were all taken, our superintendent arranged with the people to hold our school one hour very early in the morning and another at night, which was agreed upon, but was altered last year by a kind Governor, who saw the difficulty of the children getting any education under such arrangement. Just imagine children from four years going to the English school early in the morning for an hour, after which they were to go home and take their breakfast; after breakfast, away to the Spanish school. At twelve o\'clock they were to go home for dinner, and at two to return again to school until five, after which they went home for supper and to attend night school. Surely it was too much for the children, and the present arrangement is that an equal share of the day be granted to both schools. Could the public expect the same progress during these interferences as when there was no other school and we had the whole day? I pause for a reply. However, we are thankful to the Governor who last year made the present arrangement, for ""a half-loaf,"" we believe, ""is better than none."" Dear Mr. Editor, not to trespass longer on your time and space, I must conclude by telling ""Progress"" that I have not only been a well-known pupil and monitor in the Government Boys\' School (Freetown, Sierra Leone), but had been with the Rev. R. W. Hartshorn, M.A. (of blessed memory), for about three years; and so long as my ink-jug is not dried, nor my pen spoiled, he can write anything he likes against me; only, I will not after this answer his anonymous letters. — I am, Sir, yours, &c.,'}, {'id': 2978, 'article_title': ""Public Demonstrations at the Cape of Good Hope in Support of Lord Carnarvon's Recommendations"", 'full_section_title': ""Public Demonstrations at the Cape of Good Hope in Support of Lord Carnarvon's Recommendations"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1875#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_11_1875', 'content': '**PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE IN SUPPORT OF LORD CARNARVON\'S RECOMMENDATIONS.**\n\n**PLYMOUTH, Oct. 19.**—The Union Company\'s Royal mail steamer Asiatic arrived here to-day.

He then left the room, calling upon Port Elizabeth to follow, which most of the leading merchants and inhabitants did, and were continuing to do when the door was closed upon them. Mr. Paterson rebuked Mr. Merriman, and said that his indiscretion on that occasion proved his utter unfitness for office. The Chairman, after repeated efforts to get a hearing for him, and finding it impossible, led the Commissioner off by the back-door, and veritably broke up the assembly.

In the midst of this never yet heard of success at Abeokuta, the Bishop arrived, questioned Johnson how many slaves he had, and the native agents under his superintendence—he having met with them previous to the arrival of the Bishop, and devised plans by which they are to gradually impress on the minds of the converts the evil of holding their fellow-creatures as property, and to be disposed of at any time of need; and they did not tell him they had any.

He said that the people must have been very rich, and have plenty of money, else they would not have neglected asking him for his annual subscription towards the School Board Fund. The people at once willingly misconstrued the Bishop's meaning, and said, Is it because they are rich they should be made to pay five strings for class, and two and a-half strings subscription towards the School Board Fund, when the Bishop, who has been helping them, is still willing to help them? Why should they, then, tax themselves (and perhaps the Bishop only gives 1l. or 2l. paid annually)?

What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

Sierra Leone has belonged to Great Britain for over eighty years, and is the most considerable of these colonies, and the centre of government of the whole Coast. Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were in 1866 placed under the Governor of Sierra Leone, much against their wishes and their interests, and it is the government and welfare of these three smaller possessions which have been the most neglected. For nearly 300 years English merchants have been trading in Gambia, which is the nearest colony to the mother country. The annual imports during the last ten years have averaged 127,000l., and the exports 155,000l. The annual revenue is raised by import and export duties, and amounts to 18,000l., out of which sum over 6,000l. is paid in salaries to the Governor and about 25 civil officers appointed by the Colonial-office. The principal grievance of the merchants resident there is that the Imperial Government appoints all the officers, taxes them heavily to pay the official salaries, and affords no protection whatever against the surrounding native tribes. There is a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, but only one merchant is a member, whose presence is tantamount to being useless when opposed to the opinions of the Government officials. The Gambia merchants complain that in 1870, after attempting to dispose of this colony, the Imperial Government withdrew all the troops, and ever since they have been denuded of all means of defending themselves; and although the Home Government has been appealed to for help, not even a gunboat has visited the colony during the last 16 months, and the colony itself has been compelled lately to arrange for the purchase of a small armed steamer to run up and down the river. Serious disturbances have recently broken out among the natives on British territory, and the natives having threatened an attack upon Bathurst—the seat of the Government—this colony has been compelled to obtain aid from the French Government, and to get their town garrisoned by French troops, and the harbour protected by a French war vessel.\n\nThe colonists also complain that they have now no direct mail communication with this country, and that they are compelled to contribute 1,000l. per annum towards the useless maintenance of a small steamer running once a month to Sierra Leone, 500 miles further down the Coast. During the last five years there have been in Gambia five different Governors or acting Governors. The present Governor was appointed in October, 1871, at a salary of 1,300l. per annum; he has held his appointment eighteen months, out of which time only seven months have been spent by him in the colony.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-25', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_04_1873#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said.

This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets.

An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The Arrest of King Ja Ja', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'SIR,—I note in some of the daily newspapers an announcement of the arrest of King Ja Ja, of Opobo, West Africa, by the British Consul, on account of his disregard of certain trade obligations.

One of the conditions of the treaty which Ja Ja signed (Article 6) expressly prohibited strangers going to the interior markets; this condition being further substantiated by a letter from the Consul to Ja Ja; the effect and intention of this being to secure that the European agents should only obtain their goods from the interior through Ja Ja and his chiefs.\n\nAbout two years ago, owing to the depression in the oil trade, some of these agents agreed among themselves that the price of the oil and other native productions should be reduced; and Ja Ja accordingly was communicated with upon the subject, and he expressed his readiness to accept their terms; but that the ""topside"" (a general term among the traders there, meaning commission) should be allowed to him and his chiefs, as before. This the agents would not agree to; they were willing to continue the usual topside to Ja Ja himself, but not to his chiefs. Ja Ja remonstrated with them, and pointed out that Opobo was made by himself and his chiefs. Immediately a white flag was hoisted in five of the factories, which meant that they stop all further business with the natives.

The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

Slavery and slave-dealing has been renewed under our rule on the Gold Coast. ""Quite recently 5,000 girls and boys were brought from Salaga and other districts in the interior for sale at Accra and other English territory on the coast. This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government.

A desperate war is ravaging the richest region of South America. The South Seas are perturbed with anxieties and desires concerning New Guinea and the New Hebrides. Asia has its Tonquin question in the south, and throngs of other questions in the west and north. Europe is overridden with armies and with difficulties, civil, religious, and international. But any who love to fish in troubled waters may be recommended to turn their thoughts to Africa in preference to all. Africa riots in questions of every sorts and to suit every taste. Spain has its eyes upon new possessions in Morocco. France, besides its latest preoccupation with Madagascar, remains busy with Tunis, and has not made up its mind about Tripoli. A British army holds half of Egypt, and a religious war engages the rest. Abyssinia is so habituated to anarchy that itself and its neighbours are scarcely conscious of agitations which are as violent as ever. On the West Coast every few months the British public hears that it has been warring with negro tribes and desolating their homes in the interests of civilization and commerce. A new element of curiosity and excitement may at any moment be now anticipated from the contiguity of Mr. Stanley and M. de Brazza. Mr. Stanley, it is announced, has been instructed by the Association which commissions him to be as friendly towards M. de Brazza as is compatible with the defence of its territory against trespassers and a protest against annexation. Mr. Stanley\'s acquaintances will know how he is likely to interpret those liberal instructions. It will be surprising if an iron will like his and a fiery ambition like M. de Brazza\'s find the Congo or an entire continent sufficiently spacious to contain both. In North Africa and in the central west various white races share the duty of preserving the country from stagnating in peace. In the south the European ingredient is less multifarious. It is not at all less proficient in the art of setting itself and its native neighbours by the ears. The Cape Government enjoys a profuse choice of subjects for solicitude and controversy. Basutoland has not ceased to be a care because the colony has determined to wash its hands of the glory and cost of its custody. All its chiefs are proposing to fight, and they are too close to the colonial borders for Cape colonists to look on with composure at the conflict. The Pondos are as restless as the Basutos, with the additional vexation that when they are not fighting one another they are lifting the cattle of white farmers across the frontier. In the interior a multitude of critics are inclined to scrutinize suspiciously the new policy towards the Basutos. The Transvaal has its hands still full of contentions with Caffres within and without. It wants British money, and it wants to curtail the little British influence the Convention allowed. On the southeast coast, Natal, according to its custom, is equally uneasy and unable to decide on the precise form the remedy for its grievances should take. Hardly a section of African soil, north and south, and east and west, is without its vexations and feuds, in which Europe is obliged to interest itself, and of which the telegraph is compelled to attempt to chronicle the shadowy stages. A predominant sentiment of Englishmen at home, as they read these fragments of obscure African news, must be a desire either to know more or nothing, to be able to intervene with effect or not at all. On the Congo it is pleasant to feel that Mr. Stanley may be left to himself. He is not an English subject; and his enterprise, however sincere the sympathy of Englishmen with its objects, is not an English enterprise. Yet even on the Congo England has considerable mercantile interests at stake, and owns corresponding rights which it cannot surrender or suffer to be trampled on. Higher up, on the Gold Coast, its powers are larger, and it exerts them more amply. There would be a satisfaction in knowing the principles on which the periodical shelling of negro villages for offences against English trade proceeds, and whether the Colonial Office have a policy in relation to such matters, and what it is. On the Gold Coast there is nobody to interfere with England, and English supremacy, it may be suspected, is used at times somewhat too vigorously. In Egypt it might be wished on behalf of Egypt itself that it were used more masterfully than at present. Europe regards England as responsible for the health of Egypt; and England hesitates to assume the prerogatives which that responsibility implies. South African embarrassments permit an easier remedy, with a diminution instead of an increase of the burdens of empire. England often finds imperial responsibilities heavy without being free to abdicate them.', 'last_edit_date': '1883-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1883#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The People of Lagos upon European Influence upon the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""Looking at the question from an economist\'s point of view, commercial intercourse with foreigners enriches our country. It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The colonial regimes were no exception to the truism that every ad› ministration makes use of intermediary structures, largely for reasons of economy and effectiveness.

Indeed, in the search for such authority structures and personnel, the colonial officials often created new ones which they could understand and use. Such were the 'warrant chiefs' of South-eastern Nigeria, the native authorities among the Maasai in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), and in parts of Uganda outside Buganda, and most of the so-called chiefs (chefs de paille) under the French, Belgians and the Portuguese. But even then, the elites so recruited to sustain colonial rule were hardly any better treated than the Africans who were raised through education in the colonial system. Like the new educated elites, the 'traditional' rulers fell between two stools.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Chieftaincies were abolished where considered superfluous and created where considered colonially useful. Perhaps the most striking example of this process occurred in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) where, after 1918, the reforms proposed by the colonial minister, Louis Franck, led to a drastic revision in the colonial order of things. The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there. Faced with an elaborate number of local rulers whose range of authority they were then unable to discern, the British introduced the principle of the warrant chief whose authority extended over districts of many thousands of people but derived directly from the warrant issued by the colonial government. 18 Operating as a disruptive agent in connection with these factors was the local administrator. Whatever his intentions, he invariably became a surrogate chief. As Delavignette described the situation with satisfaction, the colonial administrator was not an administrator at all, but a commander and recognized as such by the African population under his control. His primary function, he asserted unequivocally, 'is to act as a chief.$^{19}$ The reserved and unobtrusive role which Lugard had hoped the British Resident would generally play in Northern Nigeria was denied in their territories by the French and Portuguese administrators, both sets of whom were prominent in the exercise of local authority.

The centralized nature of colonial administration in the French, Portuguese and Belgian systems assured the retention of legislative authority in the metropolis. In the British African possessions, however, colonial councils did emerge as proto-parliamentary bodies with appointed or elected membership, or both, and with functions varying from the advisory to the legislative, thus unintentionally but logically preparing the way for political devolution. While the Africans began to make their appearance in the colonial conciliar system, and most particularly in the British version, their number and the means by which they were appointed effectively guaranteed that they would have no noticeable impact on the mode of European domination in the inter-war period.\nThe crucial institution of all colonial organization was the district or provincial unit, called a cercle in French West Africa.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion.

Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

These changes occurred without civil strife, in part because there had always been considerable autonomy in outlying districts, the growing prosperity of which made office at the capital less important.\nSo far only the upper levels of the administrative system have been discussed. Administration at the 'grass roots' was more uniform (and similar to that found elsewhere in West Africa). The smallest units, households or camps, were grouped into larger units, defined by a territory or by kinship. Generally pastoralists, Tuareg or Fulbe, were more organized through links of kinship than were agriculturalists, and in consequence retained their own ardo'en or tambura as leaders. Their cohesion gave them a political strength that the more fragmented agriculturalists did not have, but this superior strength relative to the rest of the population did not last into the second half of the century.\nIn larger, long-settled towns and villages ward representatives could be co-ordinated by one of their number, known as the mai gari, magaji, dagaci or mukoshi.

The function of the administration was primarily tax collection, but this was as much a political as an economic act; to pay was also a symbolic act of submission, to refuse payment was a token of rebellion. As a necessary part of tax collection, the administration gathered political information, ratified appointments; collected shares of inheritance, took charge of and dispatched the property of strangers who died en route; organized the arrest of a criminal or a runaway slave, forwarded defendants in civil cases, arranged the release of someone wrongfully detained or someone to be ransomed; took intractable cases for mediation by the office› holder or themselves answered charges of oppression by complainants at the amir's personal court; and in time of war organized the recruitment of people for campaigns.

It appears that Captain Grant Elliott, who is the representative of the Belgian Association, in the administration of the Kwilu and Niari districts, was absent recently when the agents of the Dutch and German houses called at his station for assistance against a threatened native attack on the Mpila river. A party of police in the service of the Belgian Association, under the command of M. Hodister, promptly rendered assistance, and the threatened attack was averted. The French commander at Loango claimed the Mpila river as French property, and arrested the member of the Dutch house for making war on French territory. M. Hamel, representative of the Dutch factory, was stated to have been knocked down, bound with ropes, and treated in a brutal manner by the French Senegalese soldiers. On Captain Elliott's return, he demanded the release of M. Hamel, on the ground that the Mpila river was under his administration, but his demand appears to have been refused. The French frigate Le Second arrived at Loango on Oct. 24, and peremptorily ordered that M. Hodister, who commanded the police force which went to the assistance of the Dutch house, should be given up and taken to Gaboon, to be tried by the French Governor-General. With this demand Captain Elliott declined to comply, and upon its becoming known that the Association officers were fortifying their stations at Grantville, great excitement prevailed, especially among the natives, who offered assistance to Captain Elliott, which he, however, declined. The demand for M. Hodister to be given up was repeated by the commandant, and again refused by Captain Elliott. The French frigate then left for Gaboon. It seems that the French accused M. Hodister of having broken his *parole d'honneur*, but upon Captain Elliott asking for an explanation, the accusation was frankly withdrawn. After this, Captain Elliott proceeded to Gaboon, in order, it is believed, to place the whole question before the Governor-General. Personally, the relations between the French and the Association officers are very friendly and cordial, the French naval authorities having placed their ships at the disposal of the Association officers whenever a passage is required from one port to another, and it is, therefore, hoped that the unpleasantness which has arisen will be satisfactorily settled. M. Frontaine, the head of the Dutch house at Banana, had arrived at the Kwila river, and expressed surprise that only the members of his factories had been molested by the French, while the representatives of the German house, who accompanied Major Hodister to the Mpila river on the occasion, had not been interfered with. We understand that M. Hamel was held prisoner in Gaboon when the despatch was sent off.""}, {'id': 5503, 'article_title': 'Further Troubles on the West Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Further Troubles on the West Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1887#article-12', 'issue_date': '01_03_1887', 'content': ""The British and African Steam Navigation Company's royal mail steamer Calabar, Captain W.

When the Calabar left Accra there were apprehensions of serious disturbances in the Gold Coast capital, owing to the presence of about 2,000 armed Adanquah men. It seems that the followers of the King of Adanquah have been impeding the trade route from the interior. The Governor of the Gold Coast sent word to the King, requesting his attendance at Accra, allowing him to bring an escort of 200 men. The King arrived, but instead of 200 men he had 2,000 followers, all of them well armed. The British Governor was scarcely prepared for this, and there was naturally some uneasiness in the settlement at the presence of these men, as it was feared they would come in contact with the natives of the British settlement. The only British man-of-war near at the time the Calabar passed was the Express. She was lying at anchor at Accra, but her machinery was out of order, and she could not then move from her anchorage. The Adanquahs were scattered all over the town, and had also got into Christiansborg. It was said that even amongst the British officials a good deal of uneasiness existed, owing to the presence of the men; and the Governor had refused to give subsistence money to more than the 200 he had allowed the King to bring.\n\nAt Winnebah there was also a good deal of uneasiness. Winnebah is one of the Gold Coast ports. One of the inhabitants had been sentenced to be hanged, and the sentence was to be carried out two days after the Calabar left. There are factions in the town, and the class to which the condemned man belonged had vowed their intention of rising against another faction, to which the murdered man belonged, if the sentence of hanging was carried out. It was the intention of the authorities to carry out the sentence, and it was expected that serious trouble would arise.\n\nFrom Sherbro' disquieting news was also received. Captain Hay, the English official, had gone up the Sherbro' River with about 150 men to try and bring about a peaceful termination of the matter. The Sulymiah district, in the same vicinity, was also disturbed, and Captain Hay intended to visit that place also. His escort consisted of a portion of the 1st West India Regiment and some native police. Trade had been stopped owing to the disturbances in Sherbro'. The cause of the affair was the encroachment of native tribes on British possessions.""}, {'id': 6596, 'article_title': 'THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY.', 'full_section_title': 'THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY.', 'last_edit_date': '07-19-1895', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1895#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_08_1895', 'content': 'You will remember that that officer had disregarded his formal written agreement, which we have here, to respect our territory up to beyond Yola, on the south bank of the Benue, and to 100 miles beyond Ribago, on the north bank of that river; that he had stopped our postal vessels and threatened to fire upon them; that he had boasted publicly of having ""chased the English from their territories""; that he had raised against us the powerful Emir of Muri with whom we had a direct treaty, as well as with his suzerain, the Sultan of Sokoto; that he had supplied Muri, for this purpose, with some of the arms and ammunition which the French Ambassador had formally engaged, in writing, to her Majesty\'s Government, should be exclusively employed for the personal defence of the members of the mission, and neither given, yielded, or sold to third persons; and, finally, that—according to the written accusations of Lieut.

The action of the Company in taking steps to restore order, after nine months of useless protests, was not only justified, but was unavoidable. Matters on the Middle Niger have not yet reached such a point, and we may reasonably hope that the French Government, representing the practical good sense of the French nation, and not the reckless chauvinism of the extreme section of the Colonial Party, will do justice to the well-founded and friendly protests of her Majesty\'s Government.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

It may well be supposed that the country is in a disturbed state. The people of the district of Lake Mantumba, of Irebu, and Lokolala and all the Mobangi towns have crossed over to the French side. Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers. Even then the State could not leave them in peace; they heard that they came over at night to their old homes to get food, and they stationed canoes and lay in wait for them, with orders to shoot all they caught, and to my knowledge they shot seven people in one night. The State is strong enough to-day to do these things because the people lack unity. They have no leaders, no common cause, and no weapons to fight. Their condition is deplorable, and needs our sympathy, as well as all that European public opinion can do to secure for them the blessings of a righteous government under which they can live in peace.\n\nRegarding the State officers and their manner of administration, Mr. Murphy said: ""The white officers do not know the language of the people they govern, and trust too much to their Native soldiers, who are, as a rule, men belonging to a hostile tribe, whose chief aim in life is to plunder. These men are sent out to fight very often without any responsible officer being with them, with the result that many cruelties are perpetrated which might have been avoided. It is impossible for the Governor at Boma—four weeks\' journey from Stanley Pool, which ought to be the real seat of Government—to manage his vast and unwieldy territory, so that the commissaires and petty governors of the interior districts have almost unlimited power.

The French population of the Colony had an affection for the Queen, but they had a great dislike to the Bureau Coloniale in London. What really the Colonies wanted was to have the management and control of their own local government. They thought they could transact their own business better than other people—better, even, than the Colonial Office in London. One certain remedy for the discontent that prevailed was to give to the Colonists far more control than was now permitted them over their own affairs. In fact, what they wanted was an extension of the principle of local self-government.\n\nBeyond that, he would like to suggest a reform nearer home. The Colonial Office, whether rightly or wrongly, was very unpopular in the West Indies and in our West African possessions, and in his opinion one great cause of that unpopularity was to be found in the fact that the department in London was not strong enough to deal with the large and important mass of business that came before it from the Colonies. No doubt they had a highly-trained body of men in the Colonial Office, some of them men of first-class ability; but then the total staff, including the Permanent Secretary, Assistant-Secretaries, and clerks, only numbered forty-eight. One grievance which the Crown Colonies had was in the matter of patronage, for all appointments, except those of over £200 a year, rested with the Colonial Office. This occasioned great indignation in the Colonies. The outcome of such a policy was that all the appointments were filled by strangers, and, as an illustration, he might mention that on his arrival in the Mauritius he found that of the eight official members of the Colonial Government only one was a Mauritian. What he had on the subject of Colonial patronage applied to all the Crown Colonies, and it was only too evident that some reform must be made in the direction of the reforms accomplished in the Home and Indian Civil Services. He had no doubt as to the loyalty of these Colonies, if they were justly and properly administered.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-05-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1887#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Leader', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We are all more or less acquainted with the phrase, ""grandmotherly government,"" and know how much annoyance is caused—and that, too, with but little corresponding advantage—when the Legislature takes upon itself to decide upon minor questions of purely social interest, the solution of which is best left to the individual; but the complaint of the inhabitants of the West African Settlements is not that now and then the Legislature meddles with matters best left to individual judgment, but that the people are altogether suffering from ""over-government."" In dealing with districts and races which have been only partially brought under the influence of European civilization and social custom, there can be no mistake more fatal in its ultimate results than attempting to impose a standard of right and wrong dependent upon principles which the native is altogether incapable of appreciating. And it is, therefore, most refreshing to notice that one of the conditions upon which the Charter recently granted to the National African Company (now the Royal Niger Company) was issued was that ""in the administration of justice regard shall be had to the customs and laws of the nation to which the parties belong."" This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It is generally admitted that of all the white officials who within recent years have held appointments on the West Coast of Africa there was not any one so successful in his administration as Governor Maclean. ""He is remembered"" (quoting from a recent number of the *Western Echo*) ""as a perfect adept at everything pertaining to government,"" for with only a very small armed force and a total revenue of less than £4,000 per annum, he managed to maintain peace both within and without the borders of his district. Maclean\'s great influence over the natives was in no small degree attributable to the intimate and appreciative knowledge of the local laws and native customs which he gained during the time he occupied the post of Judicial Assessor, as he found out that among the natives there was a complete and well-understood system of laws connected with both personal property and land, which system, be it remembered, had been handed down, generation after generation, from time immemorial, and was without doubt much better suited to the native understanding than the comparatively modern and elaborate English system of jurisprudence, which, too, is ever varying in its details at least. What is needed to give the native of the West Coast a fair chance of social and domestic improvement, is a frank recognition of his own laws and customs—so far, at least, as they are not repugnant to international law and the best interests of humanity—together with a gradual reduction of the present large and expensive official establishments, and a corresponding lightening of the burdens of taxation, and an assimilation of import and export duties.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Governors, and other Superior Officials, for the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There are great difficulties in the way of efficient administration on the West Coast. This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Governor Freeman, before leaving Lagos for England, issued the following\n\n**PROCLAMATION.**\n\n*By his Excellency Henry Stanhope Freeman, Governor, Commander-in-Chief in and over the Settlement of Lagos and its Dependencies, and Vice Admiral of the same, &c., &c., &c.*\n\n""Whereas his Excellency is about to leave Lagos for a few months, and is desirous that the inhabitants should not have any cause or excuse for discontent during his absence; and whereas he has seen that in many parts of the town houses and premises are fallen down through want of proper protection from the rain, and knowing that Calabar mats cannot be obtained in sufficient numbers to repair all damages daily occurring:\n\n""His Excellency has therefore been pleased to postpone, for six months, carrying into execution the provisions of the Ordinance No. 8, of the 9th April, 1863.\n\n""In making this concession, his Excellency cannot but refer to the seditious spirit which was shown by the inhabitants of Lagos about six weeks ago, when compliance with the ordinance was urged upon them.\n\n""This rebellious spirit entirely prevented the accomplishment of the wishes of the people; for it is not by seditious meetings and threats of insurrection that this Government can be guided.\n\n""The inhabitants of Lagos having yielded and shown their respect for law and order, his Excellency has much pleasure in granting them their desire.""\n\nThis is a sample of the grandiloquent in African colonial government, and is characteristic of the course hitherto pursued in the colony where it was promulgated.

Far from this. No one can be more convinced than we are of an honest and enlightened attention to their duties on the part of the permanent staff of the Colonial Office, upon whom the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the time being, must always depend for information to guide and assist him in determining matters brought under his consideration and awaiting his decision. The fault, when fault there is, is not chargeable to individuals, but to the system; and not so much even to the system itself as to the want in it of a power of expansion adequate to the pressure upon it. When we fix our thoughts upon the vast colonial possessions of Great Britain, and upon the mass of important questions relative thereto that must necessarily be referred to the Colonial Office, our only wonder is, not that, as in the case of the West African Crown colonies and settlements, there is often fatal neglect, practical and gross injustice, and a paralyzing apathy, but that the Colonial Office should be at all able to deal satisfactorily with so many, so varied, and such vital interests as are continually pressing upon it for consideration and authoritative decision. That abuses should spring up, and be allowed to grow and ripen in small Crown colonies, where the voice of public opinion, in the absence of a concentrating and repeating medium, is so small and faint that it can scarcely make itself heard at all in opposition to the loud, stentorian, and decisive utterances of a proud and self-sufficient officialism, cannot be a matter of surprise to thinking men, or justify a sweeping condemnation of the supreme authority that could, and no doubt would under more favourable circumstances, have suppressed and annihilated them. The sun never sets on the dominions, more or less, under the supreme control of the Colonial Office of Great Britain; and it is only natural that among those colonies, as in ordinary human life, the old proverb should be realized that ""the weakest goes to the wall."" What remains for these weak ones, being hard-pressed against the wall, is that they should cry aloud, and get their cry lustily and continuously prolonged and repeated, and thus enforce attention to their situation and their wants. We have shown how and why it is that the progress of such colonies has hitherto been, more or less, a matter of indifference to the mother country, exulting in the exuberance of its wealth, and the seeming invulnerability of its manufacturing monopolies; and that thus it was the development of the resources of those colonies on the West Coast of Africa, tempting and magnificent as they are, have not received even the smallest share of that attention which their importance demands, and would have received from the administrative authorities of a less opulent and, consequently, more necessitous European Power.

""Very bad man, sar, Englishman, drink too much whisky, take all poor negro money, get drunk, go back to England; bad man, Englishman. I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case. You have done good service to the whole of the Coast in helping to reform official abuses, and although this place belongs to a foreign Power, your sympathies, I believe, are African, and therefore not confined to the settlements of your own country, and have an influence beyond them, more than even suspected by yourself."", 'last_edit_date': '1878-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""He offered the following prescription that could not have found favour then among colonial rulers; 'it is necessary that this elite should be recognized and given a better welcome by us.

Instead, colonial authorities concentrated on consolidating their control and exploiting the human and material resources of their colonies.

However, the international environment, with its streaks of liberalism being expressed on colonialism and colonial affairs,$^{5}$ made a change of attitude inevitable in the long run.\nBut colonialism did not affect only the educated elite and the traditional rulers. To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies.

The number of chefferies was reduced from 6095 in 1917 to 1212 in 1938. Furthermore, an entirely new administrative unit, called le secteur, was introduced for purposes of consolidation. Along similar lines the French in West Africa also created a new unit, a grouping of villages into a canton, which, in the words of one governor, 'is placed under the authority of an indigenous administrative agent who assumes the name of canton chief.$^{17}$ In Libya the population was subjected to new administrative organization by a royal decree of 31 August 1929 which notably allowed for the division of the nomadic peoples of the colony into 'tribes' and 'subtribes' at the discretion of the governor and upon the advice of the regional commissioner. And even the British made such alterations in the eastern district of Nigeria when indirect rule was introduced there.

The development of the colonized was none of their business. Where there was 'development' in the colonies, it was by and large a by-product of activities intended to promote the interests of the colonizers. It would be meaningless to imagine the colonial state apparatus making important policy decisions without taking into account the interests of the unofficial representatives of imperialism. These unofficial agents operated especially through com› mercial firms, mining firms and banks. They represented group interests in the colonial legislatures and different committees, or acted as pressure groups. In the absence of well-organized African representation, as was the case in most colonies, white settlers and representatives of expatriate companies were able to obtain many concessions from the colonial govern› ments at the expense of the local populations. Colonial policy and practice, in other words, were shaped by both political and economic determinants. As a matter of fact, in many cases, the unofficial elements affected the local population more directly than the administration did. They bought and collected agricultural products from the former and sold imported goods to them. They also employed indigenous labour. In both cases, there was very little government interference. Evidently the prices of exports and imports and the level of wages affected the people's day-to-day life more than the district commissioner's annual tax-collecting visit to the rural areas. Such a state of affairs was in no way a peculiarity of a few colonies. It was the normal reality of colonial economic relations.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in East Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The Young Associations', 'content': ""Something of their attitudes may be garnished from the list of grievances the KCA leadership presented to the governor when the latter visited Muranga in 1925.

The petition also dealt with the local problems that the colonial administration created for the people, such as the compulsory rebuilding of sanitary huts to prevent plague and the banning of the growing of cotton and coffee by Africans. Finally, it put forward programmes for improvement, asking the administration to expand the training facilities for hospital orderlies, for the building of a high school, and for the setting up of a school for girls. These requests made little impression on the colonial authorities.\nBut official scorn did not deter these leaders.

In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 103, 'article_title': 'CHRISTIANSBORG.', 'full_section_title': 'CHRISTIANSBORG.', 'last_edit_date': '01-12-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1863#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_02_1863', 'content': 'In our conversation the subject of the Aquapem road formed a part.

Mr. Ross, the late Acting Governor, re-established it at Annamaboe, and he has succeeded in the Cape Coast district, by promising that the collected sum should be entirely devoted to the benefit of the district, and by appointing some gentlemen to watch that this is done. Of course, it is not my lot to devise the best means to increase the treasury; but whatever is done should be done so that the public can trust. This was not the case with the former poll-tax. Much was promised and nothing done. Our people here will probably say that the money collected in former years should first be expended for the benefit of their country before they pay another tax. On the other hand, it is evident, that if we sow nothing, we shall never reap. But if we open the resources of the country, we shall soon have our Government coffers full—trade alone and private enterprise cannot do all. The Government must take care for better communications. There are many people who believe that the course which Sir Benjamin Pine took—by appointing clerks of the districts, to report to the Chief Civil Commandant, and by making this officer to move about in the districts and settle disputes, watch the chiefs and keep up a friendly intercourse with them—was best adapted for our territory. He had found a very able hand in a Mr. Freeman, who did very well.

If one of these hands, owing to some dissatisfaction or other cause, were to give you notice to quit your establishment on a certain day, and on that day leave, you having previously accepted his notice, and thus established an understanding between you that he would leave on that day, would you on a future day, your business becoming stagnant for want of sufficient hands, stigmatise him as having abandoned his post? Why such a representation would be looked upon, to say the least, as malicious in the extreme. I was appointed both by the late Governor Pine, and Colonel Conran, then Military Commander, Acting Chaplain previous to the departure from the Coast of the late Chaplain in May last. After a series of dissatisfactions, owing to you know full well what, I sent in my resignation to the present Lieutenant-Governor in September last, which resignation was accepted, and I accordingly left the Coast. How comes it then you should write in your January No., in the column of ""General Observations,"" as above—viz., ""The Rev. Lambert M\'Kenzie, who was left in charge"" and so on? Why I was neither ""left in charge"" by the late Colonial Chaplain, as you were pleased to affirm, nor did I *abandon* my post.

Moreover, if we accepted the resignation of a clerk there would be no difficulty in filling up the appointment immediately.

The French population of the Colony had an affection for the Queen, but they had a great dislike to the Bureau Coloniale in London. What really the Colonies wanted was to have the management and control of their own local government. They thought they could transact their own business better than other people—better, even, than the Colonial Office in London. One certain remedy for the discontent that prevailed was to give to the Colonists far more control than was now permitted them over their own affairs. In fact, what they wanted was an extension of the principle of local self-government.\n\nBeyond that, he would like to suggest a reform nearer home. The Colonial Office, whether rightly or wrongly, was very unpopular in the West Indies and in our West African possessions, and in his opinion one great cause of that unpopularity was to be found in the fact that the department in London was not strong enough to deal with the large and important mass of business that came before it from the Colonies. No doubt they had a highly-trained body of men in the Colonial Office, some of them men of first-class ability; but then the total staff, including the Permanent Secretary, Assistant-Secretaries, and clerks, only numbered forty-eight. One grievance which the Crown Colonies had was in the matter of patronage, for all appointments, except those of over £200 a year, rested with the Colonial Office. This occasioned great indignation in the Colonies. The outcome of such a policy was that all the appointments were filled by strangers, and, as an illustration, he might mention that on his arrival in the Mauritius he found that of the eight official members of the Colonial Government only one was a Mauritian. What he had on the subject of Colonial patronage applied to all the Crown Colonies, and it was only too evident that some reform must be made in the direction of the reforms accomplished in the Home and Indian Civil Services.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The fact is, that we are trying a new experiment (if it deserves even such a name) in government on the Gold Coast, as a means of carrying out the recommendations of the House of Commons Committee of 1865.

I think, then, that the tangible faults of the Government of the Gold Coast are these:—\n\n1. The changes of the governors are too frequent. The frequency of change is inseparable from the hardness of the labour, if conscientious, and from the doubtfulness of the reward, if ever so fairly won. With every new governor is inaugurated a new code of legislation and administration. One governor lands imbued with a spirit of centralisation, another is moved by the generous convictions of a spirit of decentralisation. One governor establishes municipal corporations, another demolishes them; one founds hospitals, another roots them out. And so this incessant introduction of new devices in the government of the settlements, at a pause of about every eighteen months, brings the Executive sagacity into contempt, and conveys to the minds of the most loyal chiefs a distrust in the power of the Government to entertain and to succeed in the maturing of any definite idea relative to the development of commercial or social reforms. The injunctions of the Government are, therefore, generally treated with indifference; not from a disloyal or refractory motive, but from a suspicion that the wisdom of the Government of to-day may be utterly tabooed by the wisdom of the Government of to-morrow.\n\n2. The Government is faulty by reason of the scandals involved in the miserable squabbles which are always distracting its own officers from their legitimate duties, and by reason of the petty wars which are perpetually festering between the Government and the tribes who live under its flag, and between the tribes whose country is conterminous to the Protectorate.\n\nThe palm oil trade has been well-nigh obliterated from the ledgers of the merchants at Accra, on account of the monstrous fine of 8,000l. imposed on the Croboes in 1858, and the trade of Cape Coast has followed suit by being paralysed by our last broil with the Ashantees.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'DISSATISFACTION IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Referring to my late communication relative to these eastern districts, I may remark that considerable dissatisfaction with the Government exists on two, among many, points.

The other grievance tells more powerfully on the interior, and involves the question of domestic slavery; some of the recent proceedings of Judge Parker having led to an impression that the Government intends to liberate the domestic slaves by force. I forbear any comment on these\n\nquestions just now. It is clear to me, however, that, humanly speaking, if our authorities at the Colonial-office do not bestir themselves, and efficiently reorganise and pacify the whole country, both the coast and interior, they may, ere long, as a point of national honour, bitterly regret the delay, and either have to abandon a ruined country, or call upon the nation (England) for the means of a large outlay of money to destroy the hydra which has been so unhappily allowed to grow into such mischievous proportions.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-08-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

With these deplorable prospects, it becomes my duty, my lord, to entreat of you to take our sad position into your most serious consideration.

In fact, as your memorialists say in their letter, anything like constitutional opposition to the Governor of an African settlement in any hobby, is branded as factious and personal, and the motives of the opposition are most unjustifiably and unreasonably impugned.\n\nI have long since thought that the office of Administrator was one that might be abolished along the entire Coast. A great saving might thus be effected, a Lieut.-Governor might be appointed to assist the Governor-in-Chief in case of need, and if it be considered advisable to withdraw the troops, I feel confident that this might also be done gradually, provided that a certain amount of self-government were given in exchange, and entire control over the expenditure. If such control were given the settlements in the Gambia would, I verily believe, be much more economically and better served than they now are.\n\nThere are many other suggestions that I could offer, by which heavy expenditure to the Imperial Government might be saved, but to which perhaps I have no right to refer in a letter of this sort; but one is so manifest that I cannot help alluding to it.', 'last_edit_date': '1869-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1869#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Colonial Office and West African Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We were strongly impressed last year with the belief of an ardent desire on the part of our Secretary of State for the Colonies for the good government and the advancement of our colonies and settlements on the West Coast of Africa. Mr. Cardwell was a strenuous opponent of the proposition to withdraw the civilising influences of British rule from any of those possessions, except, perhaps, the unfortunate M\'Carthy\'s Island, which has not the advantage of being on the sea coast. We saw, it is true, but too many evidences of the continuance of that red-tapeism which has been the bane of our Colonial-office in its relation with our colonies, but we encouraged in ourselves the belief that with the advent of Mr. Cardwell as Colonial Secretary a new era of official vigilance and activity had really dawned upon West Africa. There were evidences of something resembling the ardour of a new attachment, a desire to master all the difficulties of the position with a seeming view to an impartial and independent application of effective and effectual remedies. But that attachment—for we really believe it existed—had to pass through the proverbial ordeal, ""the course of true love never did run smooth;"" jealous eyes were watching the new-born affection, and plotting the destruction of the hopes it had inspired. The effects of these interpositions soon became visible. The corrupt influences—for all influences are corrupt that have any other end in view than the public advantage—the corrupt influences that had motived bad appointments to the Coast service gathered around their pets: these alone were in the right, and every one who complained of them was in the wrong; these were the salt of the whole Colonial service, and therefore undoubtedly the excellent of the earth; wan and meagre returned Falstaffs who had slain no end of men in buckram while away from England excited pity by their shaken and attenuated frames—as frequently the result of vicious indulgence as of baneful climate; and the Red Tape of the permanent Colonial-office pigeon-holes winding themselves around the Minister checked, controlled, and seem finally to have paralyzed him for that good we had so fondly and so foolishly expected from him. How else are we to account for what has taken and is taking place? In what other way are we to account for the non-despatch of the new code of instructions, whatever they may be, to the Coast until six months after the report of the Parliamentary Committee?—in what other way—to the neglect of all official inquiry into the state and management of the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia—the re-appointment, in direct opposition to the established rules of the service, for a new term of years, of a notoriously incompetent Governor, made still more incompetent by being manifestly under the controlling power of pernicious local influences?—the state of official abandonment in which the Administrative department of the Protectorate Government of the Gold Coast have been allowed to remain? We know of nothing more unfair than the position in which Colonel Conran has been left at Cape Coast. From the moment of his arrival there Colonel Conran set vigorously about those material improvements which ought long since to have accompanied civilised rule, and the neglect of which has been a deep disgrace to the British Government in the Protectorate. We never knew of a West Coast Governor who merited so large a measure of official co-operation and support by the Colonial-office; yet nothing has been done to second his efforts and lighten his burden. Himself only Acting Governor (eating means on half-pay, while some absentee is receiving the other half, and is nominally the occupant of the office, whose duties he may be discharging), he has been surrounded, and for aught we know to the contrary, continues to be surrounded by acting subordinate and judicial officials. The Supreme Court, or Judicial Assessors\' Court, has been allowed to remain for fifteen months under an Acting Chief Justice; during the whole of that period there have been only Acting Colonial Secretaries; for many, many months there has been no chaplain to officiate in the pretty church erected through the praiseworthy zeal and persistency of the brothers Ross. The Colonial surgeon, Dr. Oaks, the only doctor there, is acting; there is an Acting Queen\'s Advocate (a military man), Acting Receiver-General, Collector of Customs, and Post-master, Acting Stipendiary Magistrate, and Inspector of Prisoners, and no Coroner. We repeat, it has been most unfair to have thrown the responsibility of all those appointments upon Colonel Conran, who for the most part, could only employ the meagre military element at his disposal to fill the vacant posts, and has been thus deprived of that support and assistance he was so eminently entitled to. It was resolved by the Parliamentary Committee that our rule in the Protected Territories was not to be abandoned; but a more complete official abandonment has never been perpetrated anywhere. Our letters from the coast with regard to the Chief Justiceship merit especial attention. The pure, and speedy, and enlightened administration of justice among the natives—justice which they cannot obtain in their own native courts—has been the keystone of our influence and power on the Coast; and we do not hesitate to say that it is a grievous neglect of duty on the part of the Colonial-office to have allowed this great civilising agent to lose the prestige by which it was heretofore surrounded, and which was so powerful a support of the Executive Government. The new code of instructions, whatever they may be, has been sent out to the Coast. A Governor-General has gone forth and has made a hasty tour of inspection, or rather of official visits to the colonies and settlements within his jurisdiction; and although we do not and cannot admit that there has been any real valid excuse for the official abandonment we have exposed, we may express the hope that all fancied excuses will now be at an end, and the public service everywhere on the Coast be restored to a state of full efficiency.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE BOOM DISTURBANCE, AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is clear to every one capable of forming an opinion, that Sherbro' will never improve unless separated from Sierra Leone. The little settlement is capable of great commercial development, and if well worked up, would very soon become the equal, if not the rival, of Lagos in commerce. The fertile countries by which it is bordered are capable of producing, in great abundance, oil, kernels, bee's-wax, India-rubber, benniseed, rice, camwood, and ivory; while the numerous rivers by which it is intersected afford excellent waterway for the transport of these products to what may be termed the seaport. But in order to make Sherbro' what it ought to be, a company or even fifty men of the West India Regiment at Sierra Leone should be stationed there to maintain peace among the surrounding tribes, and then nothing more would be heard of native wars which are destructive of progress. It should have, too, its own Lieutenant-Governor, and be entrusted with the management of its own affairs, particularly its revenue, more than two-thirds of which are now annually spent to meet Sierra Leone deficiencies; while every department in Sherbro' has been shamefully neglected by every Governor since the cession, but most disgracefully so by Dr. Rowe, who thinks it too much to spend a little of public money to keep even the roads in repair and free from weeds, but does not scruple to squander it in the purchase of used-up English yachts and needless steam launches, which are allowed to lie and rot in Sierra Leone harbour. These might be employed in the mail service between Sierra Leone and the Sherbro', and thus put the money now wasted in the hire of a contract boat to some better use. People are not satisfied with the manner in which the Governor keeps back, from time to time, the Sherbro' mails, thereby depriving the merchants of getting their letters at proper intervals, the consequence being a disarrangement in their business transactions.

This fact is always before our eyes. We never lose sight of it, or fail to allow it influence when we have occasion to expose or animadvert on omissions or commissions there. The half-written sentence is suppressed—the intended exposé and animadversion are deferred—and we wait and hope. We can sympathise, and that deeply, with the Secretary of State for the Colonies whenever abuses that imperil British character and prestige are reported to Downing-street. That they are sure to come unofficially for the most part, is only an added bitter in the official draught; and that we, or others through whom they may come, should be looked upon for the moment as troublesome intruders, is no more than we ought to be prepared for. Whenever a Governor is selected and sent out, it may be presumed that the choice falls upon the supposed best man within the reach or knowledge of the Minister, as also in the case of all other superior officers, that they are chosen with equal regard to the duties they will have to perform, and the position they will have creditably to sustain. We feel that it must, therefore, be a source of great pain when a Minister is forced to admit to himself that the best human judgment is so very fallible, or that the only men within his reach for such appointments are for the most part so unfitted for the delegated trust. And it is because we feel this, as well as a constant anxiety for the advancement of the African colonies and settlements, both morally and materially, that we are induced to point out one at least of the causes why men who were expected to turn out well have so greatly disappointed those expectations. The salaries of Governors and superior officers on the West Coast are not sufficient for the duties they have to fulfill and the position they are called upon to maintain. Not sufficient is, indeed, far too mild a term, for they are absolutely and indisputably inadequate. Let it be borne in mind that these settlements are not isolated, distant, and unfrequently visited, like some islands in the South Seas. Two mail steamers per month call at each of them. There is an African slave-trade suppression squadron on the Coast, one or other of the ships of which frequently visits them. At all of them there are the well-paid agents of opulent English or other European houses or commercial companies. It is impossible for an English Governor, or other high official, to disregard what are considered to be the hospitable duties of his station. And, now, bearing all this in mind, in addition to the peculiarities of a climate which seems to be always either unduly exciting or unduly depressing both mind and body—bearing all this in mind, look at a miserable twelve hundred a-year for a Governor, who has to bring from England, at great cost, every article of food, drink, clothing, furniture belonging to the usages of civilised life. Is it any wonder that for the most part they have not sufficient self-command, not sufficient iron self-restraint to prevent their getting into debt—coming under peculiar obligations to the mercantile gentlemen by whom they are surrounded, who fete them and are feted by them; and that so falling into debt, and coming under such pecuniary obligations, they lose that independence which it is so essential to good government that they should maintain, are unable to resist improper importunities and demands, and are drawn into participation in practices which they ought to discountenance and to check? It is not a matter for surprise. Knowing how men are generally constituted, we should rather be surprised that even one out of ten keeps clear of the vicious circle which is so ruinous to efficiency and to administrative prestige! We notice this particularly at the present moment, when new arrangements are making as regards Governors and other officials on the West Coast, and we boldly maintain that every gentleman holding the position of Lieutenant-Governor there, as under the supposed new regulations, ought to have not less than two thousand a-year, and that there should be a proportionate increase in the salaries of the other superior officials. We know we shall be met immediately with the cry of, where is the money to come from? We reply at once by the principle that this great country has no right to employ, and is disgraced by employing, officers whom it cannot afford adequately to pay. But in addition to this, if it must be insisted on that no greater sum can or shall be allowed for salaries at any West African colony or settlement than is at present fixed for that purpose, we say unhesitatingly that means for the increased salaries may be found by changes that will at the same time benefit Africa and its people in other ways. Reduce the number of European officials—fill all the subordinate offices, many of which are still held by Europeans, with educated Africans at more moderate salaries—and do not allow the employment of any more of the latter than are indispensable. Much may be done by the consolidation of offices at present giving claim to separate pay, although the excessive (!) duties of them occupy only one or two hours a-day, or three or four hours per week. A correspondent at the Gambia showed us lately that two or three thousand pounds a-year might easily be retrenched in the Civil Service there. We cannot, therefore, admit that there would be any insuperable, or even any great difficulty in carrying into effect the changes we suggest. We desire that the characters of our superior European officials on the Coast, from the Governor downward, should stand high among the natives, whose civilization they have to promote, and we earnestly entreat the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is known to have the best interests of the African colonies and settlements so much at heart, to embody some such changes as we have here proposed in those new regulations said to be preparing. He will then do very great good. We can have no interest but the good of Africa in such suggestions—we, who have been but too generally denounced as an enemy of the whole body of British officials on the Coast, instead of being, as we are, only the enemy of vice and misconduct in officials such as are prejudicial to Africa, and disgraceful to European character. What we say is, pay them adequately—pay them even largely, but exact in return pure and independent conduct in the discharge of the duties of their office, and a good example to the people over and among whom they bear authority. Pay them well—but from that moment let it be understood that the fact of their being in any pecuniary difficulties should be a disqualification for office, and a sufficient reason for their immediate recall.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'British Officials and Pestilential Filth', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A glance at our 112th page will convince the most incredulous that it is not only in the matter of gaol discipline and management that the extremely efficient and well-selected officials appointed by the Colonial-office to the West Coast of Africa show an entire absence of that ""ordinary intelligence"" which Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen so desiderates for a proper comprehension of West African affairs. Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them. But in both cases, the colonial system finally diminished their authority."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""The most important and most discussed African component was the local chief. Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Although there was initially no universally accepted approach to colonial administration in Africa, most lines of thought converged on what might be called conjunctive administration (usually termed indirect rule); that which joined African authorities, in traditionally-held or European-imposed political roles, to the colonial government, but in an obviously subordinate capacity. The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The legacy of wars', 'content': 'In other words, while European powers were dealing with individual African states, recognizing them, befriending some and fighting others in Africa, in Europe they closed ranks along racial lines and formed a cartel to regulate the flow of essential arms to the Africans. African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Those African rulers who have been mistakenly termed collaborators were those who thought that the best way of safeguarding their sovereignty or even regaining the sovereignty that they might have lost to some African power previous to the arrival of the Europeans was not to collaborate but rather to ally with the European invaders. A collaborator is surely one who betrays the national cause by colluding with the enemy to pursue the goals and objectives of the enemy rather than the interests of his own nation.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'of the most powerful states, ethnic particularism, and internal cleavages among the ruling strata or class and occasionally, between it and their subject population.

Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa.

Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""The first positive political impact was the establishment of a greater degree of continuous peace and stability following the consolidation of colonialism in Africa than before.

But, then, conditions in Europe during the same period were not so very different either. This was the period of the Napoleonic wars, the 'intellectual' revolutions, the German and Italian wars of unification, the Polish and Hungarian uprisings and the imperial rivalries culminating in the First World War. In Africa, while it should be admitted that the first two or three decades of the colonial era, that is from 1880 to the 1910s even intensified this state of instability, violence and disorder and, as Caldwell has shown, caused wholesale and unpardonable destruction and loss of population - the population of Belgian Congo was reduced by half during the first forty years of colonial rule, the Herero by four-fifths, the Namo by half and that of Libya by 750 ooo$^{11}$ - not even the anticolonial and Marxist schools would deny the fact that after the colonial occupation and the establishment of various administrative machineries, such wars of expansion and liberation came to an end, and most parts of Africa especially from the end of the First World War onwards enjoyed a great degree of continuous peace and security.

The Ashantee general took the ground that he did not believe him as to his being the Administrator or Governor, as they usually call the chief of the Gold Coast, for no governor could travel in the interior in the manner he was doing. He said he must be some poor adventurer, going about in search of something to do, and that, unarmed as he was, with his hammock-men and only a few policemen, it was not worth their while to stain their hands with his blood. In the first place, he added, he is a white man, and we have no palaver with any white men, so he had better be liberated and sent away. By this means poor Simpson escaped from the savage knife of the King of Aquamboe. Surely the English Government should have more pity upon the people here, and send them good and superior men, more especially at such a time as this, when more than 20,000l. is collected annually for Customs duties alone, and no natives derive any benefit from it; no native agency is employed in the Government to earn any portion of it; nothing is done for the mercantile interest by improvement, such as building of a wharf, and many other most necessary things; but the Administrator takes care to employ those portions of the community who could, like wolves, catch and devour their own countrymen in gathering the revenue, and then take time to share it quietly among themselves, and studiously exclude all fit men in the country from getting any Government appointment. I fear the thing will not last much longer. The natives begin to see and feel this gross injustice perpetrated upon their enlightened men; and in the course of time, if matters are not properly organised, you will find even these very wolves turn against them, and chime in with the feelings of the other part of the community, and thereby overthrow the whole thing.

The chief of the Christian party managed also to offend the King, and this became the signal for the outbreak of a fresh revolution. The Mohammedans attacked the Christians—who were obliged to flee for their lives, two of the chief among the latter being killed. The Mohammedans, supported by the Arabs, were now in the ascendant, new officers of state were appointed, and the missionaries—both French and English—were cast into prison, being after a few days released, and told to leave the country, with the injunction: ""Let no white man come to Buganda for two years. We do not want to see a white teacher back in Buganda till we have converted the whole people to the Mohammedan faith.""\n\nThere is a lesson to be learnt from this case, and what has lately happened to the German East African Company in Zanzibar. In both cases the Arab traders were the instigators, though in the latter case they seem to have had matters simplified for them by the action of the German East African and Imperial authorities. If it be true that the German ships have occasionally been guilty of promiscuously shelling the coast, ""simply to overawe the natives,"" we can hardly wonder at the influence obtained by these Arab traders. In the ordinary way there is not much reason for this alliance between the natives and the Arabs—as the intercourse of the latter is generally confined to kidnapping and enslaving the former. But the presence of a common enemy is sure to drive them into alliance together. And let us remember the native mind does not grasp the difference between one European power and another. It is not in the interests of the Arab to enlighten them—on the contrary, it is clearly to his advantage to persuade them that all Europeans are bent upon their destruction. The Arab influence in East Africa is already immense. The chief obstacle to its further development lies in the hostility of the native tribes, who have trusted Europeans in preference, because they found that these have been just and considerate; but according to latest accounts, the Germans seem bent upon changing all this, and forcing the natives to make common cause with the Arabs.

The natives allowed trading hulks to be anchored and commerce conducted on payment of fixed sums, known as ""comey."" Bonny, Brass, and Old Calabar are among the oldest of these trading ports, the native chiefs being also the native traders. They possessed numerous slaves who were sent with merchandise to the interior markets to collect oil, which was brought to the stations and sold to the whites. Among the Bonny chiefs was the father of Ja Ja, late King of Opobo; his son was brought up to the management of the business, and on his father\'s death he succeeded to his position. Of his enemies the most powerful was Oko Jumbo, who lost no opportunity to humiliate him. The Europeans could only let matters take their course; they regretted constant fighting of Oko Jumbo and Ja Ja, but the relations between the Europeans and natives being strictly commercial, nothing could be done. Suffering reverses, Ja Ja was forced to fly with the remnant of his people after great slaughter at the hands of Oko Jumbo.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established.

Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably.

Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Congo Agreement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The recent agreement between England and the Free State excited in France a universal feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The fall of the Cabinet presided over by M. Casimir-Périer happening on the day this agreement was made known to the French public prevented this feeling finding expression in the French Parliament, as the members of the Chamber had before them nobody to question. The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy. If the Foreign Office wants to prevent so general an opposition from becoming acute it will aim at such an arrangement as may put an end to so dangerous an antagonism, and afford a gratification to the reasonable ambitions of both great nations, whose enormous colonial territories are indeed sufficient.”', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.639, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West African Conference', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The European Conference, to discuss matters connected with commerce and conquest in the continent of Africa, assembled on Nov. 15th, in the Palace of Prince Bismarck, the hall appointed for its sittings being the same as that in which met the momentous Congress of Berlin in the summer of 1878.

In 1886, the British administration was also able to convince Ibadan and the Ekitiparapo (comprising the Ekiti, Ijesha and Egba), who had been at war since 1879, to sign a peace treaty. That the British had accomplished so much in Yorubaland by 1886 should not surprise us. Apart from the activities of the European traders and missionaries, which had preceded the wars, after fighting among themselves since the 1850s, the Yoruba were themselves war-weary and needed peace; hence their acceptance of the intervention by the British. The only state in Yorubaland that had effectively resisted the missionaries, the British traders, and the Lagos administration, until the 1880s was Ijebu. Bent on occupying Yorubaland from the early 1890s, the British decided to teach Ijebu a lesson and at the same time demonstrate to the remaining Yoruba states the futility of opposing them.$^{46}$ Using an alleged insult to Governor Denton in 1892 as a pretext, the British launched a wellprepared expedition of about 1000 men armed with rifles, machine guns and a Maxim gun.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

They used disturbances caused by local feuds as an excuse. In 1887 they could find no such excuse when they removed Jaja of Opobo for his opposition to direct British trade in the Imo river valley. The rulers of Nembe (Brass), lying on the main Nun estuary of the Niger, were involved in quarrels between exploring and trading British expeditions and local peoples from the 1830s when British citizens got killed or shot at. The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic tensions > Social change', 'content': ""Other types of tension became more accentuated in the centralized states during this period, namely Asante, the Bambara kingdoms, Yatenga, the kingdom of Wagadugu and Gwiriko: all of these witnessed rivalry between the lordly or noble class and the ruler. Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 137, 'article_title': 'DAHOMEY, ENGLAND, AND ABEOKUTA.', 'full_section_title': 'DAHOMEY, ENGLAND, AND ABEOKUTA.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1863#article-16', 'issue_date': '23_03_1863', 'content': ""We are told, indeed, that the King exceeded in kindness and in compliment, and went even beyond this, offering Whydah to us—his great seaport—the place of embarkation for slaves destined for Cuba, if they can survive the horrors of their sea passage.

The African-Aid Society have especially reason to congratulate themselves on the justness of their views with regard to Dahomey. It is now more than two years since they memorialised Her Majesty's Government to send a commissioner to the King of that country. Although assailed on all sides by doubts as to the personal safety of any person who might be thus sent, they have never wavered, and at every convenient opportunity have reiterated that request. Their information respecting both King and people was too certain to allow them to participate in any fear. They knew that what the King desired in his heart, above all other things, was, that some Englishman, clothed with command, and bringing a direct message from the British Government, should come to him. His pride and dignity were involved in his obtaining this virtual recognition from England, similar to that which his father had received. Their memorial prayed, moreover, that, if necessary, a subsidy might be granted to the King, to cease whenever legitimate trade should have brought him a revenue equal to that he would have abandoned in giving up and assisting us in destroying the slave-trade, at our request.\n\nThe reception of Commodore Wilmot by the King of Dahomey, his chiefs and people, has set at rest the question of the accessibility of that monarch to the remonstrances and counsels of England. Our prestige there is very great. All were jealous of the preference which we seemed to give to Abeokuta. That envenomed the feelings of the Dahomans against the Abeokutans, and the very decided terms in which the former spoke to Commodore Wilmot on the subject show that there is but little chance of peace between the two until the issues of another foray into the Egba country shall have been tried. We deeply deplore that Commodore Wilmot could not obtain an abandonment of the King's designs against Abeokuta. But, notwithstanding the state of isolation from England in which the Abeokutans have placed themselves, by their unjustifiable and offensive rejection of Mr. Vice-Consul Taylor, and their subsequent proceedings, they ought to be perfectly able to protect their town against troops on whom a three weeks' march without commissariat supplies must tell with most enfeebling effect.""}, {'id': 176, 'article_title': 'LAGOS', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS', 'last_edit_date': '05-01-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-9', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': 'Trade here is in a very bad state, and we shall all be ruined, if things are allowed to go on as they have done latterly.

The sale and gift of lands at Ebute Meta by the Lagos Government, constituting as this does an absolute claim and assumption of British authority over that portion of the main land, is a measure of such extreme importance as bearing upon the present and future relations between the British colony of Lagos and the native government of Abeokuta, that nothing short of the most imperious necessity, and the most indisputable and indefeasible claim, can possibly justify such proceedings. There is no portion of the West Coast at which the development of productive resources and the increase of commerce, may be so rapid as in the Abeokuta Territories (with Yoruba generally) and Lagos, provided there be a constantly good and friendly understanding and amicable relations between Lagos and Abeokuta. But for this it is essential that nothing should be done on the part of the Island Government to wound the just susceptibilities, or aggravate the unfortunate distrust of the Abeokutans, as regards British encroachment. The progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Yoruba countries and primarily among the Aku people, and the increase of the trade of Lagos, are desired results necessarily bound up together and inseparably united. It is not for the permanent mercantile interests of Lagos that she should be mixed up with the wars and disputes of the interior, except as a great civilised pacificator—as the representative of British Christian civilisation acting for the amelioration of adjacent heathen lands. But if Lagos holds absolute possession on the main land, she can scarcely fail to be involved in such native wars and disputes; and it must be expected that questions will continually arise to disturb the friendly intercourse of Lagos with the interior. We regard this matter of the present and future relations of Lagos with the main-land people, and especially with Abeokuta, as one of such very great importance, that we feel it to be our duty to solicit for it the prompt and especial attention of the Governor-in-Chief. Among the gross neglects of duty of Governor Blackall we look upon his conduct as regards this important matter, as one of the most serious, and at the same time, most irritating to native susceptibilities and suspicions.

The Egbos were grieved at it; they laid wait but did not succeed in wresting the powder from them. The Egbas then declared their roads to Ibadan closed.

The former has been remedied by our never-to-be-forgotten G. W. Johnson, one whose manly determination is worthy to be copied, and who tried to form a good government at Abbeokuta in 1867, when a customs-house was erected at Aro ""Abeokuta,"" and presents were sent from Abbeokuta to Ibadan and all its adjacent countries, and to the furtherest north, with the message that they were allowed to pass through Abbeokuta to Logas by paying a small stipend, which system has given liberty to the people from Rabba, Ilorin, Ogbomoshor, Oshogho, and Ibadan of coming down here like bees to trade with us. They stopped coming since the war began. The latter, which could neither be attributed to the Egbas or Jebus\' dishonesty, but to the native traders here, has also been remedied by our merchants here, when the Egbas detected the false measures, and made great palaver with the Logas people at the Isheri market, and the Jebus, as well at the Ejerin market, by ordering for capsulled gin and pieces of cloth with red or blue stripe on both edges, which has made it since impossible for any one to water gin or reduce thirty yards of cloth to twenty-five.

The Governor, not feeling satisfied with their reply, and believing that the war was being carried on by a retrograde minority of the people, threatened to bring the Egbas to reason by closing the road to Abbeokuta and preventing all trade between that place and Lagos. Further robberies on traders, and the prospect of an attack by the Dahomians on Abbeokuta, led the Governor to issue a proclamation recommending the Europeans residing there to leave the place, and eventually to carry out his threat of proclaiming a blockade of Abbeokuta; these proceedings were very displeasing to some of the inhabitants of Lagos, and were made the subject of complaint by the Church Missionary Society in England, who addressed a memorial on the subject to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which they urged that immediate measures should be taken for checking the policy of the Governor.\n\nNow, without denying that exception might perhaps be taken to the language and style of the Governor's proclamations and communications to the native chiefs, and admitting that his policy may have been injurious to the Abbeokutan cause, it does not, therefore, follow that it was either improper or injudicious. In an interview with the acting Governor in 1863, the head chief of the Abbeokutans not only admitted that robbery and destruction of property were the natural results of war, but stated that it was their custom, under such circumstances, to destroy trade and property in order to recruit the army, and to drive the people to war, and that if they allowed trading there would be no soldiers.

At last the efforts made have been crowned with success. The contending factions were grouped into two opposing sides. On the one side were the Ibadans, a powerful tribe situated right in the centre of the region of the war, and, therefore, surrounded by enemies; and on the other was a confederation of tribes under the general name of the Ekitiparapos. Man-catching was the real object of the war, and herein lay the great difficulty in the way of mediation; for it was obvious that none of the man-catching tribes would surrender their main source of revenue without a struggle. However, with the aid of two educated natives, a treaty of peace was signed in July, 1886, and ratified in the following September.\n\nThe first circumstance which opened up a prospect of successful mediation was an intimation received by Administrator Moloney, at Lagos, of a quarrel between the King of the Sebus and his people, the former wanting to continue the war and the latter to end it. It was not till long afterwards that Sir Samuel Rowe felt he was justified in interfering. His first attempt was not encouraging, but ultimately the Kings of the Ekitiparapos confederacy, twenty-six in number, appealed to the Governor, stating their grievances against the Ibadans, and asking him to prevent their being supplied with ammunition from Lagos through the agency of an Ibadan there.\n\nThe answer came from Mr. Moloney, who had assumed the government of the colony, and he addressed it to all the belligerents, rating them soundly for continuing the war, and offering his services as mediator. The replies were favourable. An armistice was arranged, and conferences were held. Statements setting forth the case for each tribe separately were forwarded to the Governor. In one of them (from the commander of the Jebus) the following passage occurs: ""Ile Ife is regarded by all our nation as the sacred spot from which we originated, and the Oni is respected as the father of all the Kings. This is why the Jebu King felt it his duty to reinstate the Ifes in the town. It was from Ile Ife that his father went to settle in the Jebu country.

The process of land alienation and its political and economic repercussions in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia have been well documented by M. P. K. Sorrenson 3 and Giovanni Arrighi.$^{4}$ It has been argued that British perception of economic activity in Kenya at the beginning of the twentieth century led them to look for economic agents from outside. Contrary to welldeveloped peasant agriculture found in Uganda (especially in Buganda) under the control of centralized political institutions, the argument goes, the economies of most communities in Kenya were too backward to be relied upon as a springboard for economic growth. Consequently, the argument concludes, white settlers were chosen to form the base of economic life of the dependency.$^{5}$ This line of thought offers only part, and the lesser part, of the explanation. There were many parts of the British Empire where indigenous economies were miserably undeveloped. The coastal regions of Kenya are a case in point. The fact that these regions were spared from settler colonization clearly indicates that the Kenya Highlands had something special to offer for European settlement. Evidently it was the temperate climate above other factors, which attracted the white settlers. The land occupied by settlers was mostly over 1400 m above sea level. Such areas were among those with the highest and most reliable levels of precipitation. In short, the alienated land was situated in the most favourable agricultural zones.\nThe beginning of land alienation in East Africa was discussed in Chapter 7. It took a dramatic trend especially in Kenya after 1909 and was carried out at give-away prices. In 1903 only about 2000 ha had been alienated to Europeans in Kenya. By 1914 the area alienated had risen to about 260000 ha and to about 2740000 ha in 1930.$^{6}$ This was a very substantial chunk of the arable land, bearing in mind the fact that the Kenya Highlands (about 90000 sq km) comprised less than 15% of Kenya's area and yet supported over 75% of the total population of the country until the 1930s. The chief losers were the Gikuyu, but the Nandi, Maasai, Kipsigis and others also lost land."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""The increase in European population led to more alienation of land. Throughout the period 1900-35 Europeans held a disproportionate amount of land. By 1911 they had acquired about 7700000 ha; slightly less than the areas of the Native Reserves. Land alienation continued, and by 1925 Europeans owned about 12500000 ha which included nearly all land over 900 m within 40 km of the railways$^{12}$ where temperatures were mild and precipitation was adequate and reliable. In contrast, by 1925 Africans had purchased only some 18000 ha of land outside the Native Reserves. This figure vividly illustrates their inability to compete with Europeans under the then prevailing circumstances. But up to this time, landownership did not have a rigid legal seal in favour of the white minority. It was the Land Apportionment Act, enacted in 1930 and enforced in April 1931, which legally promoted the interests of the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The Act divided the country into four major categories. ' 3 Native Reserves (22.4%) were the areas within which land was held accord› ing to customary African laws; the Native Purchase Area was reserved for purchase as farms by individual Africans, and could be regarded as com› pensation for loss of the right to buy land elsewhere in Southern Rhodesia; the European Area (50.8%) consisted of existing European-owned land and a further 7700 ha all of which henceforward could be owned or occupied by Europeans only. 'All urban areas lay within the European Area.'$^{14}$ The Unassigned Area (18.4%) comprised 720000 ha of poor inhospitable land, and was held by the government to be distributed in future among any of the other categories. Evidently, the Land Apportion› ment Act of 1930 introduced racial prejudice into the allocation of land, but did not reject the distribution of land between the races prior to 1925. Consequently it prevented the possibility of 'separate development' of the races within their respective area. The white minority were allocated such a large amount of land because by then Southern Rhodesia enjoyed internal self-government dominated by the whites.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': 'In Northern Rhodesia relatively less land was alienated to Europeans.

As early as 1894, and again in 1897 the British introduced a Lands Bill in the Gold Coast which was to establish direct British control over lands which were said to be vacant. The reaction of the people, as has been pointed out already in Chapter 6, was the formation of the Aborigines\' Rights Protection Society in Cape Coast in 1897 by the educated elite and the traditional rulers to resist this proposed legislation. The Society sent a delegation to London in May 1898 which succeeded in persuading the Colonial Office to drop the Bill on the grounds that there were no vacant lands in the Gold Coast and that every piece of land was owned by one extended family or another.

At one time over 50% of all alienated land in the most fertile parts of the Rift Valley was owned by two syndicates and four individuals. It was also in this area that speculation went out of proportion. Farms which sold for half a shilling per acre in 1908 were resold for ten shillings per acre in 1912. Two years later the same land changed hands on the market at twenty shillings per acre. 11 In Southern Rhodesia an even greater proportion of land was alienated to Europeans. Between 1890 and 1900 European entrepreneurs and adven› turers poured into the country expecting to find a 'Second Rand', which was nowhere to be found. Only small and scattered mineral deposits were discovered. Many of the Europeans bought land from the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which ruled by Charter on behalf of the British Crown, and settled in Mashonaland as farmers. Then in 1894 each member of the Victoria and Salisbury columns recruited to crush the Ndebele was promised 6000 acres of farm land. Land alienation was extended to Matabeleland. Unlike the situation in Kenya, the European population increased very fast, and between 1900 and 1935 Southern Rhodesia had more Europeans than any other country in tropical Africa. By 1901 their number had reached 11000. Within a decade the population had more than doubled to 23 000, and by 1926 there were more than 35 000 Europeans in Southern Rhodesia.

It can be stated in general terms, however, that whereas Africans remained in practice in control of their lands in British West Africa, many of them were deprived of theirs in British East and Central Africa. There were, however, some important variations from colony to colony in each region.\nIn Uganda and to a lesser extent Tanganyika, most of the fertile land was owned by the indigenous population, the Africans. With a few ex› ceptions, for example Buganda in Uganda, the Bukoba and Kilimanjaro areas in Tanganyika and Gikuyuland in Kenya, land did not acquire market value on a large scale, and it was held communally. Every member of the community had the right to land. In most cases it was labour, and not land, which was the scarcer means of production.\nForeigners, mostly British, secured and held concessions on land with mineral and timber resources, but such arrangements had little adverse effect on the local agricultural communities. In some cases, however, serious hardships were faced where mineral resources were located on rich arable land.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': 'rulers.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Alpers has noted, \'What Africans received in exchange for ivory, even though it had little intrinsic value in their own societies, were goods that in no way equalled the value placed on ivory by the merchant capitalists of India, Europe and America.\' 65 This discrepancy was particularly acute in the sale of captives. In return for the lost labour power, the Central African societies received a variety of inexpensive perishable commodities and weapons of destruction, neither of which compensated for the depletion of the work force. Similarly, when Africans hunted ivory they were exhausting a limited resource and were not receiving capital goods that expanded the productive base of their societies. Recent research suggests that they were not only distorting their economies but also destroying the ecology.\nAs the region was becoming progressively impoverished, disparities in wealth and social equality became more pronounced. Although more detailed research is needed to determine the character of the production systems and the allocation of surplus in specific Central African societies, it is clear that the dominant aristocracy, often allied with all or a fraction of the merchant class, was the principal beneficiary. The emergence of the powerful Yao chiefs, Makanjila and Mataka, testifies to the growing political and social differentiation within these societies, as do the desperate efforts of the Makua rulers to remain in power.$^{66}$ A similar phenomenon occurred in the sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona and in the Chikunda and Arab-Swahili conquest states, where a small political-commercial class prevailed despite growing opposition and periodic revolts.

The slave-trade was another difficulty, and we must be careful how we supported a Government which encouraged such a trade. He believed that in Abyssinia we must take a little of the responsibility of slavery there upon ourselves. In referring to the Khedive, Sir Fowell Buxton contended that where his troops had gone they had carried on a slave-trade. There was great fear that Colonel Gordon might not be able to keep his eye on every case, and it was well to see whether the existing governments in Central Africa might not be turned to some good account. Sir Fowell concluded by moving the first resolution: ""That this meeting desires emphatically to protest against any proposal to extend the authority of Egypt into the regions of Equatorial Africa, as being alike injurious to the peace and civilization of that continent, unjust to independent native States, and calculated to promote the evils of the slave-trade.""\n\nThe Rev. W. Denton, in seconding the resolution, said that the slavery which exists in Turkey was so utterly abominable that he could not speak of it in a Christian assembly.

The skipper of the Sea Bird replied to all this in the manner characteristic of the British sailor, and landing his cargo at his owner\'s wharf, went on his way. There seems to have been only one old sailor left in charge, and he hoisted the Union Jack over the goods, and sat down to wait the result. The Germans soon bore down upon him in a body, and pulled down his flag, and chopped his flag-staff to pieces, and threatened him with all kinds of pains and penalties. Soon afterwards a steamer, the Namaqua, came into the harbour, and she also was boarded, and when the captain also refused to land his goods at the German settlement, or to pay customs\' duty on them, a threat was made of opening fire upon her from a rusty old six-pounder which was observable on the shore. No actual violence, however, seems to have been offered; and the goods having been safely landed at their destination, a party of men was brought over from the islands to protect them. And on the shores of this lagoon on the West Coast, in 25.40 deg. South, the English and Germans confront each other in no friendly attitude. The matter was deemed sufficiently serious for Her Majesty\'s ship Boadicea to be sent up, and Captain Church, R.N., has duly impressed upon both parties the necessity of good behaviour. The leader of the Germans is a Mr. Ludertz, and he alleges that he has acquired sovereign rights over all that portion of the coast, having purchased it from the native Chief who now rules. He has extended his dominion down to the boundary of this colony at the mouth of the Orange River. Whether either of these purchases can be recognized is a question; but the visit of the Boadicea will have shown that even Angra Pequena is not quite out of our reach, and the Cape merchants can protect their rights and property. The general opinion is that there is not room for two flags in South Africa, and our right to the place is to some extent proved by the fact that in 1794 Captain Alexander, of his Majesty\'s sloop Star, took possession in his Majesty\'s name of each several bay and inlet along the coast, ""by hoisting the King\'s colours, firing three volleys, and turning over the soil.'}, {'id': 4977, 'article_title': 'THE POLISH EXPEDITION ON THE WEST COAST', 'full_section_title': 'THE POLISH EXPEDITION ON THE WEST COAST', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1884#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_12_1884', 'content': ""The British and African Steam Navigation Company's royal mail steamer Roquelle, with passengers and mails from the West Coast, arrived at Liverpool at the beginning of the month.

Arntz, in which the question given to him was—""Can the independent chiefs of savage tribes cede their States?"" This question presents two aspects—first, the rights of the grantor; secondly, the rights of the grantee. First, they say, with regard to the law of nations, we must ask ourselves whether the chiefs of savage tribes can make treaties, &c., or whether the tribes they represent are considered as States capable of making international treaties. The answer given was, that the rules of the law of nations had been looked upon as the special privilege of Christian races; and it was only in 1856 the Porte, by the Treaty of Paris, was permitted to participate in the advantages of international law and of the European concert. Therefore his opinion is that it was obligatory on these nations that they should recognize these laws, and they could not allow those nations to participate in its advantages who did not recognize this law as obligatory upon themselves. Publicists and moralists taught that Christian sovereigns should conduct themselves honestly, and observe the rules and justice of equity and Christian morality. Feeble, half-savage races, deprived as yet of the benefits of civilization, are now no longer considered merely as prey for the rapacity of civilized nations, or as furnishing a field for their enterprise. But what are the conditions under which a State can be capable of negotiating treaties? According to Klüber, a certain number of men and families congregating together, and fixing their abode in a country, associating themselves and submitting to a common chief with the purpose of insuring the safety of all, form a State. Sovereignty is acquired by a State at the time of its formation, or when it frees itself from a condition of dependence. Therefore, only territories without masters, that is, those in which no sovereign power is as yet established, can be rightfully available for occupation.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1885#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there. The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The rivers are connected by a network of cross creeks, being indeed one delta; so from the Opobo Ja Ja\'s people found their way to the interior oil markets, and the oil trade of Opobo was established. The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

As things stand, we make no pretence to the sovereignty of the country; we only constitute ourselves the final authority in matters of dispute between the natives and traders of whatever nationality, and debar our continental neighbours from proclaiming themselves masters of the country. Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed. This is the danger to which we are exposed, for the destruction of the natives means loss to the traders and the abandonment of commerce.

It has witnessed the definite transference of the entire tract from the dominion of savage and barbarous tribes to the hands of various European Powers—notably, France, Germany, and England. Whilst all of these, and particularly England, have had commercial relations with the West Coast for many years, it has only been during the last couple of decades that the territory has been portioned out, and European ascendency over the Native races made itself felt finally and irremovably. No more concise or accurate summary of the march of events in this portion of the African continent is probably to be found anywhere than that contained in Vol. III. of Mr. C. B. Lucas\'s ""Historical Geography of the British Colonies"" (Frowde).\n\nIn discussing the influences which have combined to render possible that fairly precise delimitation of frontiers in West Africa which any ordinary map of the continent now displays, Mr. Lucas points out that nations take to colonial enterprise for the most opposite reasons—sometimes in consequence of a great failure, sometimes in consequence of a great success. Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa. In Italy, too, the same law of national life is operating; but up to the present Italy\'s colonial enterprises have not been characterised by a striking measure of success.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-05-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_05_1897#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have numerous treaties with the natives, beginning from 1826; they relate, in some instances, to cessions of territory, and always contain engagements for the protection of trade, the abolition of slavery, and the preservation of peace.

The local Government has carefully abstained from any interference in the civil and religious wars which the tribes in the neighbourhood periodically wage against each other, and whenever it has come into collision with them it has been for the vindication of its rights against their aggression; indeed, inquiry shows that in the greater number of instances in which interference has been called for of late years, the Pagans, and not the Moslems, have been the subject of it. There is no doubt but that Mohammedism is slowly but steadily making its way south, and that it will probably eventually exercise its sway over the whole of the countries in which we have established ourselves; but, although it is impossible not to hope that the day may be far distant, any attempt on our part to impede its progress would be as useless as it would be unjust.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Progress on the West African Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African rivers situate in the Bight of Benin, commonly known as the Oil Rivers, have been placed under the protectorate of Great Britain.

These are cultivated not only by the people of the settlement, but also by the natives from the interior, Serawoollies, Tillichbunkas, and other nomadic tribes who occupy or hire from the owners land on the banks of the creeks and rivers, and in some instances to a distance of forty miles inland, and with the assistance of their domestic slaves, plant the nut about the end of June and reap it at Christmas. It is calculated that one man can work an acre of land which should produce about 300 bushels, worth about 30l.\n\nThe trade is comparatively of recent origin, having only commenced in 1845, in which year the value of the export was but 199l.; in 1858, it had reached 188,000l.; of late years, owing principally to the war amongst the native tribes, it has somewhat fallen off, and in 1864 the value of the crop was only 78,000l.

It is also to be feared that the cultivation of cotton, requiring attention during a considerable portion of the year, and being necessarily carried on in the same spot, will be unsuited to the habits of the wandering tribes engaged in growing the ground-nut, a cultivation which only requires their absence from home during four months of the year, and which they can carry on wherever they please on paying a percentage for the use of the land.\n\nMoreover, a cotton plantation is liable to destruction at any time when war may break out in its neighbourhood, whilst ground-nuts are exposed to this very common danger during only one-third of the year.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-03-09', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_04_1865#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

A grant of 10,000 acres, situated near a civilised centre, is required as a basis.

At the beginning of the fourth year, however, an additional allowance of £30 per annum would, in like manner, be given, as it is hoped that by that time an income would be obtained from the land under cultivation. This arrangement would continue until the close of the tenth year, when the land would become the property of the people. The net proceeds of their earnings during this said period would be employed in the spread of civilisation among the Natives, and in the assisting of other enterprising Africans who were desirous of returning and settling down in their Fatherland.\n\nThe £25,000 necessary to float the scheme is not required at present.

Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start.

The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

In the first place, as S.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious.

There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Secondly, even though indepen› dence has been regained, there is no doubt that there has been a fundamental and permanent shift in the source of political power and authority. In pre-colonial days, power was exercised by the traditional elite of kings, queens, family, clan and religious heads.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'The struggle to maintain independence: the era of confrontation and alliance', 'content': 'of the most powerful states, ethnic particularism, and internal cleavages among the ruling strata or class and occasionally, between it and their subject population.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise. But on the West Coast he is the legislature itself, the constructor and supervisor of all measures; in a word, he is absolute and rules over the people, who are powerless, just as he pleases, and disposes of their interests as he sees proper.""', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Chiefs and Kings of the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—The interest which your journal has always taken in the affairs of West Africa induces me to solicit a space for the insertion of this article, which I trust will not fail to lead to an amelioration of the state of things, by its being brought to the knowledge of those whom it concerns.\n\nOne of the results of the Ashanti Campaign was to bring the countries on the Gold Coast under the control or protection of the British Government. The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It may be presumed that the use which Sierra Leone must always be of as a coaling station for men-of-war, and the position and influence she exercises over so considerable a portion of the country, coupled with her prosperous and peaceful state, would prevent any thought of her abandonment. The Gambia and Gold Coast have not, however, these claims to consideration, and whilst of the latter it has been already shown that the withdrawal of the British authorities would probably be the signal for the re-opening of the slave trade, it is impossible to predict a better fate for the Gambia; the religious and other wars constantly prevailing there between the natives lead to the capture of large numbers of prisoners, of whom they are always anxious to dispose to one another, but whom they would be highly gratified to be able to sell for export beyond the seas, were the opportunity which our absence would afford once granted them, an opportunity which the free navigation of their fine river would place at the disposal of tribes far in the interior.\n\nIf, therefore, the slave trade is to be effectually and economically repressed, the settlements must be maintained; and it now remains to consider what improved arrangements should be introduced into their administration, with the view of securing their greater efficiency.\n\nOn reviewing the history of the settlements, the conclusion seems inevitable, that in respect to the three smaller, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos, whether as regards the state of their finances, their taxation, legislation, and the general management of their affairs,\n**165**\n\nThe present condition of each of them may be attributed in great measure to the want of a regular and well-defined system of administration.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy.

The General History of Africa does not explicitly address the issue of human sacrifices but emphasizes the broader tensions between colonial authorities and local customs, particularly in practices like female circumcision and initiation rites. These practices were deemed 'harmful' by the British and missionaries, leading to significant African opposition, including the establishment of independent schools and churches, protests, and secessions from mission churches. This illustrates the broader theme of colonial efforts to suppress local customs and the resulting tensions. In contrast, The African Times provides specific instances of human sacrifices, such as those following the deaths of kings in Aquapim and Akim, and details British efforts to suppress these practices through treaties, like the one concluded by Captain Sulivan with the King of Dahomey, and interventions such as sending forces to arrest chiefs involved in human sacrifices. The articles also highlight the resistance faced by the British, including the reluctance of some local chiefs to abandon these customs and criticism of the British administration's effectiveness. Together, these sources suggest that while the British sometimes succeeded in suppressing human sacrifices, they encountered significant challenges and resistance in imposing their moral standards on local customs.","The General History of Africa textbook does not explicitly address the British colonial administration's challenges in imposing moral standards and laws against human sacrifices in Africa.

Boys' circumcision among Christians was not as severely interfered with, but the missions required that it should be done in hospitals or private homes. As the pressure against clitori› dectomy began to mount, the British colonial administration came to recognize it as a 'harmful' practice which 'education' would gradually bring to an end. But the Africans felt that both male and female initiation served a profoundly meaningful purpose in their communal life and that any sudden abolition or prohibition would greatly disrupt their psycho› logical, social and religious security.\nThe African opposition to the negative attitude towards female circum› cision came into the open in the early 1920s, beginning in 1923. For example, independent schools were established among the Gikuyu whose aim was to restore the practice and to provide education for those children who could not get admission into mission schools on account of the female circumcision issue. In 1929 a dance song, called muthirigu, which ridiculed missions and Christians who were opposed to female initiation, spread quickly among the Gikuyu but was banned by the British colonial administration the following year. Furthermore African opposition ex› pressed itself in the secession of many members from the Protestant and Anglican churches among the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru peoples. An independent Church, the African Orthodox Church, arose in 1928, while in 1930 a prophetic movement sprang up among the Gikuyu, preaching God's impending judgement upon Europeans and missions, but was quickly banned by the colonial administration.\nAfrican protest continued to express itself in many forms, including disturbances, attacks on mission schools, attempts to prevent preachers from conducting services, and even the murder of a missionary at Kijabe. Combined with the African protest against the missionary attitude to female circumcision was also a growing nationalism which eventually resulted in political resistance against foreign rule.

This policy avoided a head-on collision between traditional initiation and Christian missions and practice, even though the Church omitted an essential element in the girls' initiation, namely, the elongation of the clitoris, and thus failed to give malango the type of respectability that traditional initiation otherwise commanded. The Church, however, recognised the need for its' members to be at once Christians and fully initiated members of their communities, and this objective was achieved within the Church rather than in revolt against it. 14 But in the case of the Central Province of Kenya, the missionary policy towards initiation resulted in a head-on collision.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""in the exercise of local authority.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press.

This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere. It was, indeed, this loss of fellowship between the European colonialist and the educated Africans at the end of the century, which created the artificial scarcity of administrative personnel, as the new regimes began to exercise restriction on the recruit› ment of highly skilled Africans into the administrations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Islam and colonial rule', 'content': 'try to cope with Islam and established institutes to study and document Muslim life, beliefs, practices and institutions. 22 Colonial powers were determined to break up large Muslim states and religious organizations and to foster rivalry and competition among them.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D.

Being caught, unfortunately, he was brought here to be killed.

This is not a new contention of ours. Years and years ago we clamoured for a purification of the atmosphere of Sierra Leone; years and years ago, and notoriously at the time when Mr. Ussher was Administrator at Cape Coast, we called attention to, and stigmatized as it deserved, the abominably pestiferous condition of Cape Coast and Accra; using, if we remember rightly, the expression that the Chief British authorities were quite content to sit and lie upon a dunghill, so that they might indulge in their own particular enjoyments. To improve the atmosphere of the West Coast towns, by putting an end to those malarious effluvias that poison it, and make it deadly not only to the majority of Europeans, but, and especially at periods when small-pox and other epidemics are raging, to the natives themselves, ought to have been, as they have not been, among the earliest and most persistent efforts of civilized government. We believe something has been done of late in this direction; but we would have the sanitary screw put far more strongly on the populations than it has hitherto been; while at the same time the causes, other than human, of poisonous effluvia and miasma should be gradually removed. The evils which have been allowed to exist with regard to the meat-supply at Lagos come now for the first time under our notice; and we do not allow even one month to pass without thus pointedly calling the attention of the Acting Lieutenant-Governor and other superior officials there to so prolific a cause of the most fearful diseases and death, as the consumption by any classes of the population whatever of flesh in a state of poisonous putrefaction and decay. We feel sure it can only be necessary thus to bring the matter before the authorities to insure a stop being put to practices which must constantly threaten to engender some fearful epidemic that might sweep off the major portion of the population. If even in highly civilized European communities, such as those of Great Britain and France, it is found necessary to have inspectors always on the watch, to prevent the sale of diseased and decaying meat, fish, and other articles of human food, it cannot be regarded as at all surprising that in a place like Lagos, where the great mass of the population has not yet emerged from the filth of barbarism, some similar precautions should be indispensable. It is horrible to think of what is being eaten in Lagos, presuming as we do that we may rely on the account given by ""Sanitas."" We cannot credit for a moment that any of the civilized persons in the Lagos community are at any time consumers of the denounced abominations. Other education brings with it, in a greater or less degree, an education of the palate and the olfactory nerve also; and both nose and palate protest against the approach of what is necessarily disgusting to them. Civilization thus protects its children from many evils to which the uncivilized are exposed. But the civilized cannot with impunity look on with selfish indifference, while their less favoured brothers and sisters are exposed to perish, through want of that defending knowledge with which they themselves are blessed. It is a wise provision of nature that binds up the weal or woe of every individual more or less with that of the community to which he belongs. This acts as a great defence of the poor and ignorant; because not only feelings of humanity, which might be stifled, but the instinct of self-preservation operates in their behalf. We warn the civilized and educated in Lagos, and in every other settlement on the Coast in which any similar practices to those denounced at Lagos may unhappily prevail (if there be such), that for their own safety, if they be not influenced by any higher or more generous motive, they must, without delay, set about the work of putting an end to the horrible blood poisoning by means of deleterious food that is going on around them. And although the appetites of the poor wretched, ignorant creatures who, in their craving for animal food, thus banquet on disgusting garbage, may be so debased that they do not at first understand why they should be deprived of the abominations to which they have become habituated, they will, within a very short time, be brought by their own improved senses to comprehend that what had been done was done for their good. This will be a step gained by civilization among them—a primary lesson in their education—and can only be attended with generally beneficial results. We, moreover, quite agree with our correspondent that it will be an advantage gained by the whole community if stringent police restrictions on the killing and sale of flesh meat, other than poultry, should have the additional effect of leading to a discontinuance of the trade by females, except where they are recognized as merely acting as saleswomen of the flesh of animals killed legitimately, and while in a proper state of health, by their husband, or other male member of their family. Everything that tends in any, however small a degree, to elevate the condition of woman is a positive gain to the community. There is no true civilization without this advance of woman in the social scale. We have often thought this is not sufficiently in the minds of the educated natives on the West Coast. It is, however, so essential to civilized progress, that there is no real civilized progress without it; and every educated man should endeavour to discourage in all legitimate ways the employment of women in occupations involving great physical exertion, and should especially so respect his wife in the eyes and to the knowledge of the whole of the people among whom he lives, that his example may be to them a constant lesson in Christian civilization. The West Coast of Africa has advantages that no other countries emerging from barbarism ever enjoyed. Owing to the facilities of communication by steam, and the activity of an enterprising commerce, with weekly communication between it and the great centres of advanced European civilization, it is brought into immediate contact with every improving and ennobling influence that Christianity, learning, and science have gradually, and only during the tedious course of centuries, bestowed and developed. It comes into immediate contact with these in the full vigour of their maturity, benefiting by all the great intellects that have helped in the work of human enlightenment and progress. We are justified, then, in expecting from the educated in African communities under British inspection and rule, at the present day, a rate of advancement unexampled in the history of mankind. The hand of British Christian philanthropy has been liberally and unreservedly extended toward them (witness the efforts of the great missionary societies), and effected among them in a few years that which, if they had been left to their own unaided efforts, would have been the work of centuries, if even ever achieved. It is their bounden duty, then, as well as to their interest, to assist the British authorities in every possible way to cleanse the communities in which they live and have influence from all the filth and abominations of that debased barbarism out of which they have themselves been so happily extricated; and we expect from those of Lagos in this matter of disgusting and poisonous food, as well as from those of other towns in the matter of general cleanliness, an energetic assistance of the authorities, by hunting out and bringing to light, and helping to put an end to every lurking abomination of heathen ignorance, poverty, and barbarism. ""Sanitas"" has done his duty; let the authorities and educated people of Lagos do theirs.'}, {'id': 5595, 'article_title': 'Our Peace-making in West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Our Peace-making in West Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1887#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_10_1887', 'content': 'The same claim was made by the Ife chiefs in their statement: ""We wish to be reinstated in the town Ile Ife, which is the cradle of the human race.

Eventually ""points of agreement"" were settled, and at the same time Governor Moloney renewed his denunciation of the human sacrifices. The signature of the treaty of peace in July, 1886, marked the close of the negotiations. In August, the Special Commission was sent up to the seat of war to obtain the ratifications, and at the same time to procure the abolition of human sacrifices. On the latter subject the Ekiti chiefs wrote to the Governor, promising to ""take steps as early as possible to legislate for the discontinuance of human sacrifices of all kinds in our respective countries.""\n\nThe Ondos wrote to the same effect. ""Our government being constitutional,"" they said, ""no legislation can be effectually made except it be unanimously agreed to by all the members of our Council.""

They wanted to prove to the world that they were capable of good, and to show how, with proper encouragement, they could develop into a civilised, useful, and prosperous people, loyal to their Queen, and grateful for the beneficent rule of their country. In spite of many disadvantages, their country had produced active, intelligent, and thinking men—their teachers, preachers, lawyers, and doctors being examples of what could be evolved by education out of raw material. The climate in the coast towns was by no means unhealthy, and as the country became opened out a marked improvement would follow in the interior. The Gold Coast country might be said to embrace 30,000 square miles, and the total population to exceed 2,000,000. In the coast towns and other large towns in the country, the missionaries and religious societies have done much to diminish the effect of native customs, and especially by the Wesleyan Methodist Society, to whom both he (Mr. Robertson) and Mr. Bruce were indebted for their education. Sir Brandford Griffith, the present Governor, had in course of his recent expedition to Kroboe, in the Volta district, exterminated a most inhuman practice of the young men in the country, whose custom was to sacrifice a stranger before getting married. It must be admitted that the introduction of spirits into the country was doing incalculable harm, and undoing much of the good work of the missionaries. It was to be hoped that the Government would adopt some means to check this evil. The Gold Coast country was undoubtedly capable of great development. The Government had through their Special Commissioners, and through the Governor of the Province, advocated the improvement of the means of communication, believing that therein lay the whole secret of development. They recommended the construction of light railways, the improvement of roads, telegraphs, telephones, and so on. These recommendations were enforced by the speaker, who strongly urged the improvement of the approaches to the coast, by the construction of harbours, and expressed a hope that the Government would support and encourage the carrying out of public works, either by subsidy or by granting a moderate interest on capital to be expended.

Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

Is that the way the white people mean continually to treat us, to make us respect, fear, and honour them?"" He adds: ""If a black man had committed a similar offence, he would most likely have got one or two years\' imprisonment."" And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_. We believe so too. For this reason, among others, we insert his complaint. We cannot afford to have the game of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast played over again at Lagos. We know the chief authority will see this in our columns; and we hope to hear that, if justice has not been duly administered, the error will be rectified.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes.

Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

In his letter he tells us of some things we had not before heard. Mr Ussher seems by his report to have been in great pain shortly preceding his death, for the letter says, “He was heard, hard by the Castle, growling from the effects of his disease, and at death he was buried in a plain-dressed (unfurnished) coffin, and had the ill-fortune to be interred without the reading of the burial service.” Now this, if true, is, we think, a just cause of deep reproach to the other officials at Accra. What! could not one of them exert himself to obtain the assistance of a missionary, or himself read the beautiful service appointed by the Established Protestant Church? We could scarcely have believed it possible for British officials, under any circumstances, thus to fail in the last token of respect for a late chief, whom but a few hours before they may have been ready too obsequiously to serve. Our correspondent does not say that there is any necessary connection with the above and his letter, but it seems to us that there was a connection in his mind between the two statements. He says, “To this may be added that during his lifetime he was often seen on Sundays with his rifle over his shoulder going hunting or sporting, in utter disregard of the duties of the Sabbath.” Although, perhaps, there are not other high officials of the British Government on the West Coast who would thus show the “utter disregard” thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher, we have thought it well to print these observations that they may see how such conduct, when it does occur, is noted and commented upon by the Africans, who have been educated in the Missionary Schools, and who are taught to look upon the British as a Christian Government, and upon British Government officials as representing in Africa a British community one of the great characteristics of which is an abstention on the first day of the week from all ordinary secular amusements and employments, except where circumstances may make the latter absolutely necessary. And we cannot refrain from expressing our deep regret that any British Government officials on the West Coast should set such an example as is thus attributed to the late Governor Ussher. As representing such a community as that of Great Britain, we certainly think it their duty to “affect a virtue even though they have it not.” It is true we cannot charge the British Government with having done much to promote education among the West African people, and therefore cannot accuse them of imparting a mere secular education which in Africa, we are quite sure, would produce most baneful effects, as affording a people whom it is proposed to release from the sway of the most debasing, degrading superstitions, increased means for the perpetration of evil, without bringing them under the really civilizing restraint of those higher principles of human action which the blessed doctrines and precepts of Christianity inculcate for the guidance of responsible human beings in their intercourse with each other. But we would suggest, for the consideration of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, the propriety (as it seems, if what this correspondent reports be true, there is a necessity) of laying it down as a rule for Government officials in the British settlements on the West Coast that they shall not by their conduct neutralize the teaching of the Protestant missionaries, to whom the African people are indebted for all the education they have received. What we desire for Africa, and what ought to be at least desired for her by the British Government, is not only that she shall advance in civilization, but that the civilization in which she advances shall be a Christian one; and we do not think we ask too much of a Secretary of State for the Colonies in asking him to lay down such rules as we have above mentioned for the conduct of British officials holding appointments under the Crown in West Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1881-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1881#article-18', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.684, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Reported Troubles in the Cameroons', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A recent telegram from Liverpool says that news received by the West African steamship Boma from the German colony of the Cameroons, which arrived in the Mersey on Nov. 11, shows that some serious disturbances have occurred there. The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

Rather more than two years ago, an agreement was concluded at Paris between our Government and that of France with regard to the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in West Africa. The territories referred to in the agreement were Senegambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast. It was provided that the two Governments should have the right of appointing special Commissions of Delimitation ""to trace upon the spot, wherever they may consider it necessary, the line of demarcation between the English and French possessions"" in conformity with the agreement. The work of determining the boundary line between Senegambia and Sierra Leone is now about to be begun, the British Commissioners having left Liverpool on Saturday last. For some time past British merchants interested in commerce with Sierra Leone have been apprehensive that their trade with the interior might be seriously interfered with, if not absolutely ruined, by a wrongful definition of the boundary.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

The charges usually ranged from abuse of power, improper sale of land, extortionate fines, enforcement of levies to compulsory labour imposed by the colonial administration."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""He offered the following prescription that could not have found favour then among colonial rulers; 'it is necessary that this elite should be recognized and given a better welcome by us.

Instead, colonial authorities concentrated on consolidating their control and exploiting the human and material resources of their colonies. The absorbing problem was the solution to Europe's post-war problems of rehabilitation of the economy and the services. However, the international environment, with its streaks of liberalism being expressed on colonialism and colonial affairs,$^{5}$ made a change of attitude inevitable in the long run.\nBut colonialism did not affect only the educated elite and the traditional rulers. To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

In their starkest form, they were the maintenance of order, the avoidance of heavy financial expenditure, and the establish› ment of a labour force, initially for porterage and later for the creation of roads and railways but also for commercial purposes. In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less. As Lord Hailey has remarked, the basic concept of European law differed markedly from that of the African systems, for it was directed towards the punishment of the guilty and not the redress of the aggrieved.$^{20}$ Frequently, there were colonial attempts at a dyarchical judicial arrangement wherein civil litigation involving Africans was settled according to pre-colonial legal modes, while criminal law and litigation involving Europeans fell directly under colonial jurisdiction.\nHowever, everywhere, with the noticeable exception of the Portuguese colonies, a court system was developed or reinforced according to African needs as perceived by the Europeans.$^{21}$ In the first decade of the century, there were particular attempts by the Italians in Somaliland and the Germans in East Africa to extend the judicial function of African chiefs or magistrates. In the same period, the most elaborate and successful of such efforts occurred on the other coast: Lugard's implementation of'native courts'. Part of his tripodal 'native administration', the 'native court' was, in his mind, an instrument by which to 'inculcate a sense of responsibility, and evolve among a primitive community some sense of discipline and respect for authority'.$^{22}$ Presided over by Africans, and directed primarily to domestic affairs, these courts were to adhere as closely as possible to African customary law, modified only where basic customs were not in accordance with fundamental English norms.

This time, the hold-up was extended to Western Nigeria, and it ended only with the intervention of the British government.

The repatriation of savings and deposits of Africans by the banks and the discrimination practised against Africans in the granting of loans further impeded African development.\nFrom the above, it can be safely concluded, in spite of the protestations of Gann and Duignan, that the colonial period was a period of ruthless economic exploitation rather than of economic development in Africa, and that the impact of colonialism in Africa in the economic field is easily the bleakest of all."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.632, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies.

Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.636, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

We have a host of concurrent testimony that the greater portion of the deaths which have occurred among Europeans in these settlements, and elsewhere on the West Coast, have been not from climate per se, but from climate acting upon persons improperly selected, brought from other enervating climates (such as the West Indies, &c.), with constitutions impaired, or upon systems vitiated and enfeebled by abominable impurity and dissipation. It has been rare for married men to be appointed to the Gold Coast, whether in a civil or military capacity, and still more rare for them to take their wives with them. The most moral form which one description of excess assumes is for the officer, civilian, or agent to take one or more country wives, by purchasing girls from their parents. According to the custom of the country, these are marriages; but the Europeans contracting these alliances consider them as only a temporary convenience; and for the most part, when they leave the Coast to return to England, not only are the women abandoned, but the children born of them also, without any provision being made for them, and seemingly without remorse on the part of him who leaves them.'}, {'id': 2176, 'article_title': 'Interesting Report of Executive and Judicial Proceedings at Cape Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Interesting Report of Executive and Judicial Proceedings at Cape Coast', 'last_edit_date': '02-02-1872', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1872#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_03_1872', 'content': ""Sir,—My last will have prepared you for the trial of Fynn, Fynn, jun., and Forson.

Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued. Few days after, hearing at the police-station. Decision—""The Europeans to pay for the summons, 3s.""\n\nOur correspondent says: ""This is a British colony. Is that English justice? Is that the way the white people mean continually to treat us, to make us respect, fear, and honour them?"" He adds: ""If a black man had committed a similar offence, he would most likely have got one or two years\' imprisonment."" And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_. We believe so too. For this reason, among others, we insert his complaint. We cannot afford to have the game of the Eastern Districts of the Gold Coast played over again at Lagos. We know the chief authority will see this in our columns; and we hope to hear that, if justice has not been duly administered, the error will be rectified.

We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice?

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war. Not contented with the throne which he has thus usurped, he is now intriguing to acquire Western Croboe also. The present king of Western Croboe, who is now being molested, forbears to say anything, lest his opposition may end in a contest, and he may be thereby brought to the sea-coast and treated with ignominy. But there is sure to come a successor who will dispute every inch of ground that ""Sakiaty"" has thus acquired. This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SLAVERY ON THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It is no easy matter to put an end to what may be called an established injustice. Men otherwise good and humane look upon it, by the force of habit, with a neglectful indifference, really sinful—since they will not give themselves the least trouble to do for others, what they would, under like circumstances, desire that others should do for them. Things seem to remain in the gaol at Sierra Leone precisely as they were when we brought the condition of the debt prisoners there under public notice, and directed to it the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, some months ago. Again the harrowing cry of anguish and despair reaches us in the letter which we publish in another column. We know nothing of the individual in question, or of the circumstances connected with the indebtedness for which he is suffering; but this we do know, that if the statement made in the simple words of the letter, that the writer has been confined in gaol for _sixteen months,_ and that he has _again_ (showing a previous application) _filed his schedule, but that no notice is taken of it_ —if this statement, we say, be true (and it will have been a gross act of folly for a man to write us a lie on the subject), then there is something in the administration of the law in Sierra Leone, which demands the instant attention of Downing-street with a view to remedy. ""To me,"" the victim writes, ""it appears that nothing but death will remove me from this prison."" And this in Sierra Leone, a British Crown colony! If a fact, it is an atrociously disgraceful one. Sierra Leone has a bench of two Judges, receiving a joint salary of \'some 3,000l. a-year, to administer justice in a population of some forty thousand people; and here is a debted prisoner of sixteen months, filing anew his schedule, and crying to us that all his communications to the authorities regarding it are unheeded. If this man has committed fraud which justly deserves punishment, why was he not punished for it; not by detention without judgment, but by sentence of the Court. If he had not committed fraud, his case ought to have been inquired into, without any unnecessary delay, so soon as he had filed his schedule; and the necessary formalities being complied with, he should have had his discharge. For what are insolvency laws but for this,—to prevent the detention in prison of a mere debtor who has surrendered all he possessed to his creditors? If such a state of things as this now complained of exists in Sierra Leone—if the local influence of wealthy creditors can thus prevail there against a man, in defiance of the law to which he is allowed to appeal in vain,—can it be matter of surprise that we should have insisted so strongly as we have done against the appointment of a local Chief Justice for the Gold Coast Colony? We take this opportunity to renew our protest against such an appointment; although we fear, since the removal of Mr. Chalmers from Sierra Leone to be Queen\'s advocate for the Gold Coast Colony, that our protest will not _at this time_ prevail. But to return to the subject of this complaint from the Debtors\' Gaol of Sierra Leone, and the gross injustice which we have now no alternative but to believe is judicially committed or permitted there. Does not this case speak volumes against the longer continuance of imprisonment for debt in the colonies and settlements of West Africa? The more facts crowd upon us, the more are we strengthened in our former unchangeable conviction, that imprisonment for debt, _as debt,_ is deserving the execration of every Christian man, is an outrage on humanity, as well as a great social mistake. We pray the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the case of this prisoner of sixteen months (who has more than once filed his schedule) in the Debtors\' Gaol of Sierra Leone, and the case of the other debt prisoners there, may be immediately inquired into. If the complaints made to us, and on which we have now been commenting, are well-founded, we feel compelled further to say, that we cannot exonerate the Governor of Sierra Leone from all blame. With so limited a community as that of Sierra Leone under his charge, there ought not to be a case of injustice within the colony, resulting from mal-administration of the law, not known of by him; and which, being thus known of by him, could remain without effectual inquiry on his part.

Within a few years of its annexation, many Boers returned to the highveld across the Drakensberg Mountains, in protest against British failure to recognize their land claims, the British African policy, and the new political arrangements, which excluded them com› pletely from any participation. At the same time, Natal had a large African population, many of them returnees from exile whence they had been driven during the Mfecane.\nThe initial difficulties facing the weak colonial administration in Natal concerned the government of the Africans. The solutions were provided by the 1846 commission and elaborated upon over the years by Theophilus Shepstone, the Diplomatic Agent and Secretary for African Affairs (185375). The 1846 commission recommended the setting aside of reserves or locations for African settlement, and by i860 land amounting to 2 million acres (810000 ha) had been delineated for that purpose. However, the locations were situated mostly in the rugged, barren and wild parts of Natal, which were unsuitable for agriculture. The commission made other recommendations, such as provision for African education, administration of each location by a white officer backed by a black and white police force and the enforcement of the Roman-Dutch law in the place of the African laws. In view of the amount of money required to implement some of these recommendations, they were never effected. As a result, African education remained largely, if not exclusively, the responsibility of the ill-financed and . ill-equipped missionaries, while the administration was done by Shepstone.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony and Natal before 1870', 'content': ""Fluent in the Nguni languages and having lived among the Xhosa, Shepstone was able to establish some working relationship with the African communities. All the Africans living in the reserves were placed under chiefs and headmen, and where the latter did not exist, new ones were created. African laws, except those concerning witchcraft, were permitted to operate. To finance his administration, Shepstone imposed a hut tax collectable in cash or cattle (which could be sold to the white farmers for cash). His administration was consistently attacked by the white settlers because, they argued, it made the Africans economically self-sufficient and therefore prevented them from becoming labourers on the farms and plantations. But Shepstone did not lock up the Africans in locations because he loved them. Rather, he clearly saw that coercive measures to produce labourers would only result in resistance, which the comparatively weak Natal colonial administration could not possibly cope with. The settlers who criticized him seem to have ignored the contribution of Africans to the profits of large landowners who subsisted on the rentals of over half the black population living as squatters on white farms, and to the colony's revenues in the form of the hut tax. In fact what Shepstone had done was to produce a cheap administration that afforded the white colonial society opportunities to exploit both the Africans and their natural resources in comparative peace and security. 12 The white society was mostly of British origin. After the drain by Boer emigration the white population increased steadily as a result of immigration by British subjects escaping from the social problems accompanying the economic crisis of 1847-51. Financed by speculators, some 5000 white settlers left Britain for Natal in this period. By 1870 the whites in Natal numbered 18000. The increase in the number of white settlers went hand in hand with constitutional changes. In 1856 Natal was made a separate colony and granted a Legislative Council. The franchise was made colour-blind, so that male British subjects owning at the minimum immovable property worth £50 or renting property worth £50 at an annual rate of £10 could vote. But the whites made it impossible for the Africans to qualify for the vote. A law passed in 1865 allowed literate Africans with some property to petition the lieutenant-governor to exempt them from African customary laws.

The demand for labour created by the diamond- and gold-mining activities was virtually in› exhaustible. It was partly to ensure the supply of labour and partly to safeguard even more the positions of the whites - especially the Afrikaners - that a whole series of pieces of legislation was passed, especially in the 1910s and 1920s, to compel the Africans to leave their farms and places of birth for the mining and other industrial centres. These Acts included the Natives\' Land Act of 1913,the Mines and Works Act of 1911 and its amendment in 1926, the Apprenticeship Act of 1922, the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923, the Native Administration Act of 1927 and finally the Native Service Contract Act of 1932.

Thirdly, the Act prevented Africans from buying land outside the reserves from persons other than Africans except in the Cape Province and, in Transvaal and Orange Free State, except by the special dispensation of the governor-general.

Throughout the period 1900-35 Europeans held a disproportionate amount of land. By 1911 they had acquired about 7700000 ha; slightly less than the areas of the Native Reserves. Land alienation continued, and by 1925 Europeans owned about 12500000 ha which included nearly all land over 900 m within 40 km of the railways$^{12}$ where temperatures were mild and precipitation was adequate and reliable. In contrast, by 1925 Africans had purchased only some 18000 ha of land outside the Native Reserves. This figure vividly illustrates their inability to compete with Europeans under the then prevailing circumstances. But up to this time, landownership did not have a rigid legal seal in favour of the white minority. It was the Land Apportionment Act, enacted in 1930 and enforced in April 1931, which legally promoted the interests of the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The Act divided the country into four major categories.

Evidently, the Land Apportion› ment Act of 1930 introduced racial prejudice into the allocation of land, but did not reject the distribution of land between the races prior to 1925. Consequently it prevented the possibility of 'separate development' of the races within their respective area.

There is hardly any evidence suggesting that population increase might have been due to large-scale migration into the region. The increase must therefore have been a result of natural growth unrelieved by any increase in land and other important resources. As communities found it increasingly difficult to engage in time-worn practices of shifting their stock from one pasture to another or to convert more scrub-forest into savanna, some embarked on forceful appropriation of land and pasture previously claimed by others.\nSome of the rulers of these small states had begun to adopt strategies designed to control production as well as reproduction. In order to under› stand this process, one has to take a close look at the structure of Nguni society in the pre-colonial period. The society was divided into thousands of commoner homesteads each under a patrilineal head. Generally speaking the head of each homestead had two to three wives, depending on his rank in society. Each of the wives and her children lived in her own house. Each wife and her children produced food for their own subsistence needs. Usually there was division of labour according to sex: the males handled cattle production and engaged in hunting, while the females were mainly responsible for crop production.\nThe royal homesteads, of which there might be several in each state, were organized differently. In addition to the normal production activities performed by the members of each house, including their relatives and retainers, the various royal homesteads also developed, especially from the late eighteenth century onwards, into military barracks. Male regiments recruited from the different parts of the country lived at these barracks and there performed services for the king, including crop production.

The colony has avoided a very great danger. But for the small Legislative Council of Natal, the Governor, supported by Downing-street, would have given a large extent of public lands to the Kafirs under *tribal titles*. The Kafirs within the colony, now amounting to nearly 200,000, are drawn together in what are called Kafir locations. The Government in the earlier times of the colony sanctioned the authority of certain native chiefs over the Kafirs in these locations. In making over in perpetuity certain lands to the Kafirs, the Governor and the Colonial-office were prepared to apportion these lands to the several *tribes* which has been thus formed; giving, for example, when there are 5,000 males, 125,000 acres of land; and constituting the chief perpetual trustee of this property.\n\nAnything more fatal to the future peace and welfare of the colony could scarcely have been devised.

Because there alone in Africa we have absolute power over it; because there alone in Africa we are responsible for it; because there alone in Africa it is a reproach to this Christian nation—a reproach that we hope it will not consent any longer to endure. We have shown what Natal is—that it is the colony of a Christian nation, possessing a Christian population of upwards of 15,000 souls—a colony into which Christian emigrants from Great Britain are entering in a continuous, though not very copious stream—a colony into which a refugee Kafir population now numbering 180,000 has been admitted—a colony in which, notwithstanding the presence of this numerous African people, Coolies are obliged to be imported from India to perform the necessary work of the plantations. It is among those Kafirs that polygamy, as an institution belonging to them before they came into the colony, has been not only tolerated, but protected in the colony, to its manifest prejudice and loss, both in a material and moral point of view. For polygamy among those Kafirs, as in all parts of native Africa, is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. We have been told of late by some of our hasty African travellers, in excuse of the slave-trade, that a great number of the victims carried from Africa in the loathsome slave ships are criminals; and we have heard a sort of lament that where the slave-trade has happily been suppressed, the virtuous communities in question, as at Brass, Bonny, Calabar, &c., have no way of getting rid of their criminals. Well, these so-called criminals are so, if so at all, mostly through the operation of polygamy. The chiefs and head men monopolise all the women—they make of them their wives and slaves—and the lower classes of the population and male slaves are left unprovided with wives. This leads to aggressions on their part upon the coveted live property of their superiors, which becomes particeps criminis. It would be difficult to convey to our readers any adequate idea of the enormous evils resulting from that abominable institution of polygamy. In Dahomey, for example, where the sovereign power is absolute, every female child born in the country, or captured in the predatory expeditions, is the property of the king. Every man in the realm, from the highest to the lowest, receives his wife from the king, either as a gift or by purchase. No man can thus obtain a wife until he has become possessor of a certain sum, which being brought to court during the Customs, he receives a wife of some sort in exchange. In order to prevent the too great multiplication of criminals, which could not fail otherwise to take place, where the bulk of the population are precluded from the possession of wives, a number of women are set aside arbitrarily by the king as the common property of the people at large, upon very easy conditions for the latter. Ashantee is as Dahomey in this abomination. And everywhere else in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. All the hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who loathed some old polygamist for whom they were destined, and dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent. We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trustee of these lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change. We look, therefore, to Parliament to bring the power of Christian public opinion to bear upon Her Majesty's Government in this matter, and to insist upon a limitation of polygamy in the colony of Natal.""}, {'id': 637, 'article_title': 'DR.

We think that if they did otherwise they would betray their high mission. The Bishop\'s Christianity is beyond our comprehension. It must be remembered that there is no difficulty in getting rid of their surplus wife-slaves. The parents are only too willing to receive them back, provided there be not any return demanded of the cattle that had been paid for them. But in a British colony—especially where, as in Natal, the natives are refugees, who have fled from otherwise certain destruction, and found refuge there—this task ought not to have devolved upon the missionaries; the evil ought long since to have been arrested by the Government. It is most disgraceful that it has not been so arrested. The colonists would certainly have effected this, if they could have obtained the consent of the superior authorities in Downing-street. When, in the numbers of our journal before alluded to, we exposed and commented upon the awful atrocity of torturing those young female Kafirs to death by slow fire at the stake, we foolishly believed that before another twelve months should have passed away the British Government must have taken decided action in the matter. We did not believe that the advocates of polygamy and its inseparable atrocities in such countries as in Africa were so numerous in this Christian land, or that those who are not its advocates would remain so seemingly indifferent to its protected and supported existence in a British colony. We again urge the consideration of this question on the Government and a Christian public, with the view to immediate action. As the British Government have so long culpably permitted and protected this polygamy in Natal, we do not urge any violent measures.

In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. The hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs. Many atrocious outrages that have been committed seem to be traceable more or less to this cause. The Europeans are uneasy in presence of this abomination. They desire most earnestly to be rid of it. And the late burning of Kafir girls, who dared to have affections and a choice, has increased this desire. But the colonists are powerless to influence the Government at home. Shall not we, then, help them? Will Christian England, now that this enormity in one of her important colonies is clearly made known to her, rest apathetic and indifferent? We say that the two systems, the Christian and the heathen, cannot remain thus face to face with each other, and both maintained and upheld by the Home and Colonial Governments. What we contend for is this: The Government are about to distribute 1,250,000 acres of land in the colony among the Kafirs there. The grants are to be free grants for ever of about twenty-five acres each, to all the adult Kafirs. The Governor of Natal is to be trusted of the lands, so that none of them can ever be alienated without his approval. We contend that the time has now come for the Government, in making this distribution of land, to say that polygamy, an agent of confusion in the colony, shall not be further extended; that, without touching any existing ties, the Government forbid any more polygamic marriages among the Kafirs; and that the land shall descend to the issue of the one wife. There can be no doubt as to the power of the Government to enforce this Christian law, which will be far from unpopular among the great body of the Kafir refugees. But whether unpopular or not, they should be made to submit to it. They are there to receive protection, not to dictate religion or polity. The moral and material progress of the colony, and the reputation of this Christian country, all demand the change.

There is no disparity of numbers between the sexes in Africa to make it appear a law of nature that men should have half-a-dozen or twenty wives. Every such monopolist wrongs a number of his neighbours, or his adherence to his ""native customs"" in this respect has been among the causes of bloodshed and violence in wars instigated and undertaken for obtaining supplies of victims for the Bishop\'s amiable and good polygamists. We know that down the West Coast this monopoly of the women by a few leads to disorders, that in their turn conduce to further crimes and atrocities; and among the Natal Kafirs it works in many ways to misery, and at the same time to insecurity among the European portion of the colony. Parents sell their daughters for cattle; the chiefs and comparatively wealthy men thus monopolise a large proportion of the women, making of them wives and slaves, while the young men who have no cattle with which to purchase wives are left unprovided for in this respect, and of course become aggressors on the coveted live human property of their superiors in wealth.

The parents are only too willing to receive them back, provided there be not any return demanded of the cattle that had been paid for them. But in a British colony—especially where, as in Natal, the natives are refugees, who have fled from otherwise certain destruction, and found refuge there—this task ought not to have devolved upon the missionaries; the evil ought long since to have been arrested by the Government. It is most disgraceful that it has not been so arrested. The colonists would certainly have effected this, if they could have obtained the consent of the superior authorities in Downing-street. When, in the numbers of our journal before alluded to, we exposed and commented upon the awful atrocity of torturing those young female Kafirs to death by slow fire at the stake, we foolishly believed that before another twelve months should have passed away the British Government must have taken decided action in the matter. We did not believe that the advocates of polygamy and its inseparable atrocities in such countries as in Africa were so numerous in this Christian land, or that those who are not its advocates would remain so seemingly indifferent to its protected and supported existence in a British colony.

How very charming! ""There have been good, faithful men of old without baptism, and with many wives,"" and why not good, faithful Christian men now under the same conditions? But what, then, is this polygamy which merits such tender Christian treatment? Bishop Colenso\'s experience of it has been among the Kafirs.

It must be there, one would suppose, a mere personal matter, doing no injury to others, involving nothing beyond the mere possession by one man of a plurality of voluntary, contented, devoted, happy wives, who would be overwhelmed with grief and sorrow at the mere idea of their lord and master giving them permission to transfer their allegiance to another.

And the colonial feeling on this subject has been strengthened by three young girls, who refused to be given up, when sold to old polygamists, having been recently tortured to death by slow fire at a stake, and other fiendish cruelties. The cases are well authenticated, and the details are too horrible for insertion.

And a yet more striking manifestation of the same feeling has been more recently exhibited in dealing with the question of annexing Nomansland. The indifference expressed by the colonial representatives to the proposed annexation, viewed as an acquisition merely, ought to clear them and us from the imputation which British politicians and philanthropists delight to throw upon colonists of every shade. And we suppose few races realise more thoroughly the idea of social and personal independence than do the Kafirs in the colony of Natal. Now that the British flag secures them from the cruelty and rapacity of their own chiefs, and of each other—now that they enjoy for life and property the security enjoyed by British subjects—the native inhabitants of Natal enjoy a singular extent of political liberty. They retain their own laws, and can practice their own barbarous customs, while they have the free use of some of the best lands in the colony. Nor can the colonists be chargeable with having evinced any desire to degrade the social position of the native or to keep him morally where he is. It has been the chief fault of past native policy that it has failed to attempt, by practical measures, the domestic amelioration and mental elevation of the native. So far as a belief in the necessity of civilising processes is concerned, the colonists have always been ahead of the executive authorities in their avowed desire to carry out an extended and practical policy. Earl Grey—when next he rises in the Lords to stigmatise colonial shortcomings—may do so with the conviction that the plans of advancement, enunciated by him fourteen years ago, were then, and have been since, endorsed by the experienced approval of the intelligent colonists of Natal. We might, did we not wish to avoid an appearance of recrimination, go farther, and state that for years past the colonists have been at issue with the Government in regard to one of the most debasing customs sanctioned under Kafir law—that of polygamic woman-slavery—which it has been a cherished hope among Natalians to see undermined and abolished.

Because there alone in Africa we have absolute power over it; because there alone in Africa we are responsible for it; because there alone in Africa it is a reproach to this Christian nation—a reproach that we hope it will not consent any longer to endure. We have shown what Natal is—that it is the colony of a Christian nation, possessing a Christian population of upwards of 15,000 souls—a colony into which Christian emigrants from Great Britain are entering in a continuous, though not very copious stream—a colony into which a refugee Kafir population now numbering 180,000 has been admitted—a colony in which, notwithstanding the presence of this numerous African people, Coolies are obliged to be imported from India to perform the necessary work of the plantations. It is among those Kafirs that polygamy, as an institution belonging to them before they came into the colony, has been not only tolerated, but protected in the colony, to its manifest prejudice and loss, both in a material and moral point of view. For polygamy among those Kafirs, as in all parts of native Africa, is one of the greatest curses, one of the most prolific sources of crime and misery, among the various and mighty engines of diabolic mischief that are at work over that wretched continent. We have been told of late by some of our hasty African travellers, in excuse of the slave-trade, that a great number of the victims carried from Africa in the loathsome slave ships are criminals; and we have heard a sort of lament that where the slave-trade has happily been suppressed, the virtuous communities in question, as at Brass, Bonny, Calabar, &c., have no way of getting rid of their criminals. Well, these so-called criminals are so, if so at all, mostly through the operation of polygamy. The chiefs and head men monopolise all the women—they make of them their wives and slaves—and the lower classes of the population and male slaves are left unprovided with wives. This leads to aggressions on their part upon the coveted live property of their superiors, which becomes particeps criminis. It would be difficult to convey to our readers any adequate idea of the enormous evils resulting from that abominable institution of polygamy. In Dahomey, for example, where the sovereign power is absolute, every female child born in the country, or captured in the predatory expeditions, is the property of the king. Every man in the realm, from the highest to the lowest, receives his wife from the king, either as a gift or by purchase. No man can thus obtain a wife until he has become possessor of a certain sum, which being brought to court during the Customs, he receives a wife of some sort in exchange. In order to prevent the too great multiplication of criminals, which could not fail otherwise to take place, where the bulk of the population are precluded from the possession of wives, a number of women are set aside arbitrarily by the king as the common property of the people at large, upon very easy conditions for the latter. Ashantee is as Dahomey in this abomination. And everywhere else in native Africa, though the regulations may in some degree vary, power and wealth make themselves almost sole masters of the female portion of the community. In Natal, a British colony—a Christian colony—polygamy has been necessarily in some degree modified. The Kafirs both in and out of the colony differ, too, from the slave-trade worried populations of other parts of Africa. There are many possessors of property in cattle, &c. Where the female children do not become the property of the chief, they are sold for the most part to some possessor of cattle. All the hard labour of the Kafir kraals or villages falls to the lot of these women, who are in all respects slaves—hard-worked, abject slaves. And it has long since been recognised in Natal that there is danger to the females among the European community, in consequence of that monopoly of the Kafir women which results from polygamy among the Kafirs.

We leave to the gentlemen of our missionary societies the appreciation of the Doctor\'s defence of Christian missions. He says, in effect, that the efforts of missionaries among savages have been a great blessing to them; but, as to the preaching of Christianity among them being necessary to their salvation, it is all humbug. It is, the Bishop says, ""a horrible delusion,"" that this is at all necessary to their eternal salvation! After this we are more and more at a loss to conceive why the Bishop belongs in any way to a preaching Christian Church. We do not want bishops and clergy for mere secular, industrial, and moral education. And if Christianity is not necessary to salvation in Africa, neither can it be necessary in England. But what we have more especially to deal with is the Bishop\'s defence of polygamy among the natives. And, as we are not less diametrically opposed to him as regards this ""native custom"" than about the salvation of souls, we think it right to give the words he is reported to have uttered: ""Once more, I believe that the course which the great body of missionaries have taken on the question of polygamy is a very serious impediment to the progress of our work. Here again, without any authority from the Church of which they are ministers, there are many of the missionary clergy, and even bishops of the Church of England, who have laid down the law that every convert admitted into the Christian Church shall put away all his wives but one, if he had more than one, before baptism.

He at least was aware that it does not always mean the confining a certain number of women in luxurious ease, the petted or neglected toys of some rich voluptuary. He knew that it means slavery the most abject and cruel—slavery hard and hopeless—slavery from which there is no escape, when once its fetters are closed around the victim.

Several months ago some Kafirs, attracted to the ""Diamond-fields"" by the rush thither of many persons from all parts of South Africa, took occasion to supply themselves with rifles at the diggings. This proceeding coming to the ears of the Natal authorities, who have (and properly enough) forbidden the natives to have in their possession unregistered or concealed arms, an order was forthwith issued that the offending Kafirs should at once register their rifles. It appears that there was either a delay or a refusal to act on this order, and measures were taken to enforce compliance. Three young colonists lost their lives in attempting to arrest the Kafirs. Hereupon a large party of soldiers and colonists set out in pursuit of the offending natives, who fled across the mountains, leaving their wives, children, and cattle behind. Failing in their attempt to seize the males, the colonists made a wholesale sweep of all the female relatives and property of the fugitives, and, it would seem, with little discrimination as to whether they were taking the families of the innocent or the guilty. Not content with stealing from 8,000 to 9,000 head of cattle, and large numbers of sheep, goats, and horses, the Colonial authorities kidnapped (according to successive Reuter\'s telegrams) fifteen hundred of the helpless Kafir women, the wives, sisters, and children of the fugitives and others. And now comes the worst part of this disgraceful business. It is stated in the latest despatches that the wretched creatures thus torn away by wholesale from their homes, are to be ""distributed,"" and ""apprenticed out at a distance from their former homes."" ""Applications have been received for 5,000 of them, if procurable, from persons willing to employ them."" Now what does this mean? All who are acquainted with the relations of colonists and natives (especially as illustrated by the brutalities of the Queensland colonists towards their enslaved and kidnapped Polynesian islanders—slaves under the guise of ""apprenticeship"") will know well that this apportionment of Kafir women and children must naturally result in the grossest cruelties and abuses. These and other evils and crimes have as yet passed without protest from the mother country; especially as the immediate danger of a Kafir war has passed away.

The capabilities and products of the colony are so great and valuable, that a much larger European immigration than hitherto is certain in the immediate future, and will no doubt continue to flow in until the whole of the valuable lands of the colony are brought under settlement. With such a material future in prospect for the colony, it cannot be a matter of indifference, whether as regards the mother country or the colony, what kind of moral principle and feeling prevails among the civilised community of Natal. It will be admitted at once, we presume, that the moral principle ought to be a Christian one; and that the higher its standard the better for this infant giant of South Eastern Africa, which will most likely extend the limits of its territory many degrees farther north than the boundary line as at present marked.\n\nAnother portion of the augmenting population consists of coolies now being imported from our East Indian possessions by the Colonial Government, to meet the requirements of the agricultural colonists, who have been suffering under an uncertain and insufficient supply of labourers at critical periods of the year. These people will soon amount to between four and five thousand—seemingly only the small commencement of a very large importation for employment, especially in sugar and cotton cultivation."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.735, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Polygamy in Natal', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So soon as it was seen that this large and increasing influx of Kafirs was taking place, it seemed most convenient for the local Government, acting under the direction of that of Great Britain, to set apart certain large tracts of land for the habitation and use of the refugees.

These groups leveraged public opinion to pressure colonial administrations, resulting in new constitutions and elective representation, although their success in achieving economic independence or significantly weakening the colonial system was limited. This context illustrates the historical impact of public opinion and organized efforts on governmental changes in West Africa. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically highlight the African-Aid Society's efforts to bring government actions under public scrutiny, leading to the removal of abuses and recognition of the Society's beneficial operations. The articles emphasize the necessity of administrative reforms driven by public awareness, aligning with the claim's focus on public opinion's crucial role. However, they lack specific examples of diverse regions where these changes occurred, which the claim suggests.

While we have few documents on this aspect of the historical process, it appears that social changes were greater in centralized states than in societies in which administration was decentralized, greater in the coastal regions than in the lands of the interior, and greater in Islamized areas than elsewhere. While sedentary societies that did not have a centralized power structure were the most affected by the convulsions of the time, they took refuge in fidelity to their traditional code of life as an antidote to their trials.\nThe situation of slaves and caste members was much worse in centralized states. The most radical upheaval was undoubtedly the one that occurred in the Fulbe groups: originally nomads under the domination of the Gulmanceba, within a few years after the djiKäd they in turn had become overlords ruling indigenous peoples, or peoples whom they had reduced to the level of commoners, captives and serfs (bellah or remaibe), condemned to the tasks of cultivation and herding.

Over and above one-fifth of all plunder taken in raids, 57 the amir of Liptako received gifts and a tribute on harvests that was known as the zakat. Similarly, the chiefs of Jiibo received gifts at 'salutations' and levied a tax on salt for which traders were liable. Aristocrats were sometimes attended by hundreds of dependants. While the conditions of slaves improved with seniority (rimaibe could own property), the status of captives was to raise problems in Liptako.

It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the beginning of the nineteenth century: issues and prospects', 'section_title': 'Patterns of authority', 'content': ""These two models were complementary, and in practice there were many kinds of intermediate situations, waverings and compromises.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

Vicious authority is rampant, insolent, and seductive, and its scoffs and sneers and bribes are not without effect among the victims at whose expense it exists, thrives, and debauches; and it is not difficult for it to induce many of them to range themselves on its side, and against those the best part of whose lives is being consumed in constant and unrewarded exertions to procure for them those changes which are indispensable to their social and national progress.

In it we are enemies of injustice, oppression, and wrong; friends to all that is good and true; we know nothing of personal animosities, and have no interested predilections; the welfare and happiness of the African people, and their enrolment in the peaceful army of the Great Redeemer, is the motto on our banner; and all who desire to see this banner borne vigorously onward should assist us in our work. We are at this time striving to prevent what we look upon as the shameful abandonment of the River Gambia and its people to France; and rejoicing that the long-contemplated Female School at Cape Coast has been commenced. We are lamenting the continued denial of justice to the people of Sierra Leone in the matter of the wrongs and abuses in the administration of the law which we have so often exposed; joying to see that competent Africans are more freely appointed to official posts; and indulging hopes of the formation of roads in the Gold Coast territories—the establishment of steam navigation on the Volta, and the pacification of the whole Gold Coast Protectorate.

It was the latter, described as the 'aspirant bourgeoisie' by Susan Kaplow,33 who, as will be seen later, pushed the frontiers of retail trade in the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Nigeria further and further inland during the period under review.

Thus, by the end of the period under review a new rung had been added to the social ladder in Africa, an educated elite which had become divided into a professional class of doctors, ministers, teachers, catechists and agents and an aspirant bourgeoisie or entrepreneur group, as some would prefer to call them, of educated traders and merchants."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Emergence of the Western-educated elite', 'content': 'It was in West Africa that a relatively large number of members of an educated elite had emerged by 1880 and the country that produced the first significant number was Sierra Leone. Indeed, it was the Creoles, as the educated people of Sierra Leone came to be called, who pioneered most of the missionary and educational activities in the other parts of West Africa. Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W. Johnson, R. B. Blaize and J. A. Otunba Payne.30 The Gold Coast elite of the 1870s and 1880s included J. A. Solomon, E.J. Fynn, J. P. Brown, J. de Graft Hayford, A. W. Parker, T. Laing, J. H.

Such a rivalry occurred in the kingdom of Wagadugu, where Mogho Naaba Karfo (1842-9) decided to distribute to the poor among the common people the property that he had confiscated from the wealthy. In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like. At the other end of the scale were the great mass of persons known ironically as 'Cape Coast scholars', who had received only rudimentary education."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'But not all those classified as belonging to the new elite in colonial Africa owed their membership of that class to education, nor did all those who owed it to education attain a uniform standard. As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""The final beneficial social impact was the new social structure that colonialism introduced into some parts of Africa or whose development it accelerated in other parts. As A. E. Afigbo has pointed out (Chapter 19), though the traditional social structure allowed for social mobility, its class structure appeared to give undue weight to birth. The new colonial order on the other hand, emphasized individual merit and achievement rather than birth. This change together with the abolition of slavery, the intro› duction of western education, Christianity and Islam, the expansion of cash-crop agriculture which facilitated the acquisition of wealth in some areas and the many other avenues for advancement that the new colonial order introduced, radically altered the traditional social structure. Thus, by the 1930s, in place of the pre-colonial social classes of the traditional ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, domestic slaves and a relatively small educated elite, had emerged a new society that had become more sharply divided than before into urban and rural dwellers, each of which was differently stratified. The urban dwellers had become divided into three main sub-groups: the elite or as others call them the administrativeclerical-professional bourgeoisie; the non-elite or, as Lloyd prefers to call them, the sub-elite, and the urban proletariat. The elite was subdivided into three groups: the bureaucratic elite of civil servants, the professional elite of doctors, lawyers, architects, surveyors, professors, etc., and the commercial elite of managers of the expatriate firms and companies and private traders and businessmen. The sub-elite consisted of brokers, middlemen, clerks, teachers, nurses and junior civil servants, while the urban proletariat consisted of the wage-earners, store assistants, drivers, mechanics, messengers, tailors, bricklayers, etc. In the rural areas, there emerged for the first time in many parts of Africa new classes, namely, a rural proletariat of landless Africans, and peasants. The former consisted of those Africans especially in East and Southern Africa, whose lands had been alienated by the Europeans but who were not allowed to reside permanently in the urban and industrial centres and were therefore com› pelled to spend their lives shunting between the urban and rural areas, mainly as migrant labourers. The peasants were those described by John Iliffe as people who 'live in small communities, cultivate land they own or control, rely chiefly on family labour, and produce their"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'In parts of Africa, especially among such chiefless peoples as the Igbo, Ibibio, Ogoja, Tiv, Idoma, Birom, Angas and Gwari of Nigeria where it was difficult to identify the traditional rulers and associate them with the work of the colonial government, many members of the new elite came from among those who in pre-colonial times would have been classified as commoners. Some were even of the servile class or were as yet unassimilated immigrants. This was because in such places it was members of these classes who first embraced western education, tried their hands at the new professions and moved to the urban centres while the traditional elite tended to stand back. But as soon as the benefits of western education and the new professions were demonstrated, members of the traditional elite also joined in. Some colonial powers, especially France and Britain, deliberately set out with varying results to encourage this belatedly awakened traditional elite group, for instance by establishing special schools for them. With the wealth they derived from their estates and/or their salaries as local authorities they were usually able to train their sons not only locally but also in higher institutions in Europe and America.\nIn some other parts of Africa, however, the traditional elite responded early to the call of western education and modern commercial ventures. In Egypt it was this class which took the lead in establishing western-type institutions. In Buganda this same class quickly recognized the advantages of western education and commercial farming. In Ethiopia they reacted in a similar manner to western education, sending their children to Europe and America to be educated. In this way they were able to retain the leadership of their countries.\nThus the fact that the ranks of the new elite contained people from different strata of society makes it risky to talk in easy terms of conflict between the new elite and the traditional rulers. In Sierra Leone and Liberia where for much of the period the new elites were made up of people who were not indigenous to these territories, there was an under› standable tendency for the elite communities of the coast to be in conflict and competition with the traditional societies of the interior. They were inclined to be contemptuous of the traditional leaders who in turn harboured an abiding suspicion of them. In the nineteenth-century Gold Coast and in Yorubaland (Nigeria), many of the founding members of the new elite group were - or at least believed they were - related by blood to the peoples of the interior.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': ""It is not so easy to define the effects of the expanding scope of commercial activities on social formations in quantitative terms. That the number and the importance of merchants increased cannot be doubted. What is not clear is the extent to which a merchant or capitalist class may be said to have emerged. The tradition of long-distance trading with caravan centres and organization for security, provisioning, credit facilities, transportation and so on was already well established in North and West Africa and was developing rapidly in Central and East Africa in the nineteenth century. These developments occurred in Islamic areas where book-keeping was in Arabic, as well as in the old slave-trading parts of West Africa where the languages of commerce were European languages, and in areas of East Africa where Swahili was expanding as the language of commerce. There is evidence that in parts of the coastal areas of West Africa slave labour was beginning to be supplemented by expanding older forms of enforced labour, where money is loaned in return for a 'hostage' whose labour served partly as interest on the loan and partly as a guarantee that the loan would eventually be repaid. It was indicative of the increasing importance of the groups of merchants and of banking services that this type of enforced labour was greatly expanded in scope. It is said that by the 1870s on the Gold Coast, the system began to rival slave labour in significance, slavery being the method of recruiting labour from outside the immediate com› munity, and the system of 'hostages' for recruiting labour from within the community itself.$^{22}$ Yet, outside of the North African coastal cities, a distinct merchant class was slow in evolving. In the areas influenced by Christianity and European ideas, a group of merchants similar to the Victorian middle class began to emerge. But even in those places, apart from Sierra Leone and Liberia, such merchants seeking influence and power within the traditional states did so largely by obtaining chieftaincy titles within the evolving state structures. In many parts of the Sudan and Senegambia, the dominant merchants were closely connected with Muslim religious leaders, and there was not a distinct merchant class but rather a clerical merchant class. In other places there was no clear division between the merchants and the warriors and the ruling elite. Many of those who started life by going on trading ventures as young men, grew prosperous enough to organize others to go on such ventures and with such wealth bought rights to traditional decision-making offices while they managed their farms, supervised their cattle and other"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Both the new elite and the urban proletariat were important as agents making for change in rural colonial society, but the former were indis› putably the more important in the political, economic and social history of colonial Africa. Their greatest advantage over the traditional elite and the urban and rural masses lay in their literacy. The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples. Literacy gave the elite access to the scientific and social thought of the western world, equipped them to enter into dialogue with the colonial powers over the destiny of Africa, and familiarized them with the social fashions of Europe which made their life style an example to be emulated by their less fortunate countrymen.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Social and economic transformation', 'content': 'elite.

Similarly, the urban centres held out and still hold out an irresistible attraction to other classes of people in the rural areas. While some people went there to seek a fortune on their own volition, others did so in response to the tax and land policies of the colonial powers in the rural areas, especially in the settler colonies. Those immigrants who were well educated or highly skilled rose fast to become members of the new elite, or to hover on the fringe of that class as sub-elites. The less fortunate immigrants who had little or no education and who in addition were barely skilled or unskilled, sank to the bottom of the urban society to become the urban mass, also called the urban proletariat by some scholars. Many of these found them› selves at the mercy of the employers of labour, while others learned some trade and established independent businesses of varying viability.

The few exceptions included, notably, General (later Marshal) Lyautey in Morocco, Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard in Northern Nigeria and Sir Gordon Guggisberg in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators. There is among the whole of this badly payed and very wretched elite - as remote from indigenous society, from which it has been driven out, as it is from European society into which it is not admitted - a feeling of disillusionment, discontent and bitterness which it would prove dangerous to be unaware of. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.622, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""Though it has been correctly pointed out that it is difficult to group the different organizations into clear-cut categories, especially owing to their functional versatility, we shall here distinguish between three kinds. In the first group are those organizations which could be described as purely 'social', that is devoted to promoting conviviality and relaxation. These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials. In south-eastern Nigeria, for instance, where by the 1930s the colonial power was still toiling to entrench the idea of native authorities, the formation of these unions caused uneasiness in official circles.

It was the same in societies like that of the Igbo where the traditional elites had not the kind of stature that survived far into the colonial period.

These men, especially those of them at the lowest rungs of the labour ladder, have at times been referred to rather inappropriately in Marxistoriented analysis as proletarians. Apart from those who were bound by the wage nexus to the big employers of labour - the colonial government, the commercial and the mining firms, the missions, etc. - there were also the self-employed artisans who supplied certain of the needs of the urban population.\nThe life of these urban dwellers was tied to the vagaries of the world economy and market whose structure and behaviour they did not under› stand. To protect themselves in this unfamiliar economic world, those in waged or salaried employment formed trade unions for the purpose of effective negotiation with their employers for higher pay and better conditions of work. The self-employed craftsmen also formed craft guilds which helped to fix prices, standards, conditions of apprenticeship and so on.

It was played as a masquerade by the young men, wearing hooded raffia costumes, while women and non-members shut themselves up in their houses. But the main function of the members was to hold weekly meetings at which social questions were discussed.\nThe Ekpe society, which, in the hinterland village communities, com› prised all elders, became an exclusive secret organization in the large commercial community of Calabar.

Thus, in 1850, the missionaries, supercargoes, and consul pressed the leaders of Calabar to enact an Ekpe law against human sacrifice at the deaths of rulers. Ekpe may be considered to have been an asset in the political system of Calabar in that it united all the free men of wealth and influence in a common organization. But its discrimination against the large body of men of slave origin and the poor led to the social disturbances of the mid-nineteenth century, which Dike has referred to as slave revolts.\nThe association of plantation slaves known as the Bloodmen came into being specifically as a pressure group to prevent the sacrifice of slaves at the deaths of kings and lineage heads. Such an organization of slaves on a blood oath was possible in Calabar because of their concentration in plantations, and because of the common disabilities they suffered. However, the association did not become a revolt for the emancipation of slaves, or even for the seizure of political power from the Ekpe. All the association achieved was to come into Calabar from the plantations in a body each time a notable man was ill or died, and there was danger of slaves being sacrificed or made to take poison ordeal.

Macaulay gave a practical and fatherly advice; and the Rev.

There may be many ways of accounting for this, but no doubt it must be ascribed chiefly to the fact that from time immemorial the white men who came to sojourn at Accra, whether Danes, Dutch, or English, were almost invariably of a superior class.\n\nTimes are, however, changed; the English gentleman is not now so frequently met with here as in days of yore.\n\nIn those days the white man lived in harmony with the black man. Being a gentleman, he did not consider himself degraded by associating on terms of perfect equality with the coloured man whose education, intellectual attainments, and self-respect entitled him to the respect of those whose esteem is of any value.\n\nHaving in view why exact English gentlemen deem qualifications, sufficient to entitle the Frenchman, the Turk, the American, Indian, or the Ashantee to move in their society, and having that feeling which pervades all real gentlemen, those white men, when they encountered black men possessing intellectual abilities and other qualifications not inferior to their own, were only too ready to receive them into their society, and too glad to be admitted into that of the natives. The European being a man of education and good breeding felt quite as much at ease in the society of the educated black man as in that of his brethren at home; he knew that his companion, though black, yet for all that, was a gentleman; and that was quite sufficient for him, and vice versa.\n\nNow-a-days, things are not exactly the same. The white men of the ancient type certainly do visit this country and sojourn for a period, but they do not, as of old, make it their home. They make their money and are off again whence they came, or if they be Government officials their term of service expires and away they depart.\n\nThe English gentleman has been to a certain extent superseded by the English Gent, a distinct class too well known and too well described and caricatured by their own countrymen, to render a description necessary here.\n\nThese men, whom the rage for the rapid acquisition of wealth has induced to visit our parts, or others to send them here to acquire wealth for them, arrive imbued with ideas common to all ignorant men—that is to say, if beings whose minds have such a limited scope can be said to have any ideas of their own at all, and not picked up second-hand from others only a shade less ignorant than themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE POLICE MAGISTRACY AT LAGOS: TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I for one, amongst many, do not think we could have better men than Mr. Gerard, or his substitute, J.

There are the habits, customs, religion, &c., &c., of the people to be considered; also their advancement as regards civilisation. All these tend to make it a great point of nicety to decide cases that come to the Police-court. It requires a person that has been with and had some amount of experience of different grades of coloured people, their ways, manners of thinking, notions, ideas, &c., to know how to judge or decide cases that are daily brought before the Police Magistrate here; and no one can doubt but what Mr. Gerard must have acquired much experience by his former position in life, which ""Negro"" seems so much to ridicule.

Trade was brisk; merchants prosperous, or apparently so; no dark clouds threatened the political atmosphere, and so matters continued till the ever eventful and memorable year of \'63, when the Ashantee war burst with all its horrors on my native land. I was one of the many who took the field at that eventful period in defence of hearth, home, and kindred; and I was one of those who returned from the campaign disgusted at its empty show.\n\nI have watched the tide of events since then. The foolish expedition to the Prah; the rapid succession of governors; the peace hoax of one—the maladministration of another; the interchange of territories, and the complications raised by it; the consequent formation of a confederacy (the Fanti Confederation) among the kings and chiefs of the Western part of the Protectorate; the intrigues of one or two of our most influential men to attain the ascendancy within it; the want of unity and confidence amongst the principal members thereof, and many other incidental causes, have not escaped my observation. I shall therefore claim space in your invaluable paper for this letter, should you consider it worthy of insertion.\n\nThe great bane of this country is the want of unity and confidence among its principal men, the love of prejudice, the desire to rise on the ruin of others, envy, hatred, malice, and the like evils.

Show me the man who exposes the maladministration of affairs here, and he becomes ""a marked man,"" to be got rid of at all risks, to be hunted to the death. Of these we have instances; witness the Bannermans and Fiasson. Show me among the higher native classes, particularly among the educated, a rising man, one who may be looked upon as a rival contender for power, position, and influence in the country, and I behold a person of whom nothing is too bad to be said; against whom must be brought to bear all the force of intrigue, and who must be crushed to enable others the better to rise. Under such evils, where seek for the men who will be sufficiently independent and spirited to sacrifice themselves pro bono publico, in a country the natives of which are proverbial for seeking their self-interest?

Instead of being constant, incessant, untiring, earnest, unyielding in demanding that they shall be effectively represented in the said Legislative Council, by having granted to them the right and power to elect such a proportion of its members as shall give them that control over the revenue and expenditure of the colony, and in making of local laws and regulations, to which they are now entitled by the degree of education which exists among them, by their numbers, their wealth, and the amount of their public revenue, the people lay down submissively at the feet of those unworthy officials whose removal from among them they have heretofore demanded, and wait with open mouths and eager eyes for that delicious crumb of title ""Honourable,"" which nauseates us in Liberia, and which, under present circumstances and conditions, it is a deep disgrace rather than an honour to receive in Sierra Leone. Trial by jury, in all cases and causes in the superior courts, which no people caring to be free would be content to live without, is no longer the burthen of Sierra Leone letters on our table. Huggins and Montagu, with their compeers, have, we might suppose, if such thing were officially possible, become just, merciful, and pure—lovers of the Africans, as a race, and models of public and private virtue, disinterestedness, and truth. If we were of those who acted upon impulse, not principle, we might almost fancy that we had been in error in our former estimate of certain Sierra Leone officials, their characters, their conduct, and their deserts. But we never thus acted, and have not, therefore, any such error to confess; and in the few observations we may make relative to the new official, the now gazetted Queen\'s Advocate, we shall not deviate from the dictates of those principles which have ever guided us in our work for the African people. We publish in another column the farewell remarks of an editor of a British Columbian newspaper. We gather from it that the new Queen\'s Advocate has a wife and family. Will these accompany him to Sierra Leone? If they do, we hope they will be blessed with health; and will exercise a beneficial social influence. But the change from the dry atmosphere and invigorating winters of British Columbia to the humidity, and almost perpetual enervating heat of Sierra Leone, seems to us too great and extreme a one to promise healthy results. We look in vain for inducements to such a voluntary change in any other direction than that of increased pay. Mr. Alston therefore comes to Sierra Leone because it is a more lucrative field of service, and—must we say it?—because he has given satisfactory proof of that official docility which is so dear to the little terrestrial divinities who hold the supreme authority in British colonies and settlements. The eulogium which we copy from the British Columbian newspapers sets forth this docility in very strong light. ""But for his official appointment there, Mr. Alston would no doubt have been one of the most advanced Liberals of that colony."" We, of course, do not know whether this delightful official docility was pointed out by Sir Arthur to the authorities in Downing-street, as being invaluable in such an atmosphere as that of Sierra Leone, or by those authorities to Sir Arthur, as being most precious for an Administrator-in-Chief. But this we do know—viz., that the Africans of Sierra Leone have no right or title to look to such a man for help toward achieving those public rights and liberties which they are entitled to possess. Having sold their public desires for the unsubstantial pottage we have before mentioned, they will not have any right to complain of this. But they have still a right to expect that he will show himself impartial in the public duties he has to perform; that no deprecation of the African shall appear in his public or private demeanour; and that he will not endeavour to wrest justice in favour of the European as a European, against the African as an African. A conscientious and equitable Queen\'s Advocate may do much to control prejudiced, weak, or venal judges, whenever it becomes his duty to appear officially before any such persons. We will only now beg to express the hope that Mr. Alston may be a man of this stamp, notwithstanding the political subserviency of which he has given such satisfactory evidence in British Columbia; and that we may find in future just occasion to praise, rather than to blame the now recently-appointed Queen\'s Advocate.', 'last_edit_date': '1871-10-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1871#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'A Lagos Account of Administrator Glover', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Permit me, through the medium of your valuable journal, to observe that as your men of valour in England have titles or honours conferred upon them by the State, such as C.B., K.C.B., &c., for good and meritorious services, even so his Excellency John Hawley Glover, Administrator of Lagos, has had several titles of distinction conferred upon him since 1865 by the natives in Lagos and its dependencies, and by which he is known far as Dahomey on one side, and until you come to the River Niger on the other—viz.: Babba Goloba (Babba Golober), Father Glover; Bale Olotito (Baleh Olotitoh), Truthful Governor; Gomina Eko (Gominah Ako), Governor of Lagos; Ologun Eko (Ologun Ako), Lagos Warrior; Oko Ogun (Aukoh Ogun), Man of War—i.e., in naval affairs; Keneyun leti Ossa (Kenneh-', 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1868#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Lagos Mission of the Church Missionary Society', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I beg you will allow me space in your columns to give one more instance in support of your frequent endeavours to point out the disadvantages to which the educated Africans on the West Coast are subject by their more favoured European brethren, be they missionaries, merchants, or Government officials.

After three weeks on board ship, we were glad to get ashore at Accra. On landing, I was taken to Christiansborg, and introduced to the Governor and other officials. Having got into harness, I began my duties, and found that my mode of conveyance from one place to another was by go-cart. The arrangement consists of a small hand-cart on two wheels, drawn, as a rule, by one Kroo boy, and pushed behind by another, or a couple more. I was not a little surprised and pleased to find, on my first visit (Saturday), that cricket was going on, the match being Whites v. Blacks. Some of the Natives play very well, and take great interest in the game. After about a month\'s stay I started on my first trip through the bush. A hammock and eight carriers, besides six men for carrying luggage, are allowed for this expedition; and one is carried, lying full length in the hammock, at the rate of about four miles an hour. Having received instructions, I pushed on as fast as possible to take over the duties of Commissioner for a large district. These duties are many, and not at all times the most pleasant. They consist, in the first place, of magisterial work—i.e., sitting daily in court and distributing justice to the offenders; next, coroner\'s work; also performing marriages, accounting for all moneys received in Customs duties, paying all officials in the district, and if belonging to the constabulary, commanding the Hausas and civil police at the station. In fact, a District Commissioner is monarch of all he surveys. Some of those holding the office are Natives. After three months of such work, I was ordered into Accra. The Hausa force, composed of European and Native officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, are well able to hold their own, as far as Native troops go. The Native officers are fine men, nearly all having seen service, and wearing medals for campaigns as well as for distinguished conduct in the field. The non-commissioned officers and men receive extra pay for good conduct. Several of the non-commissioned officers have been to England, for instruction at Hythe, Shoeburyness, and Knellar Hall; and it is the custom to send a number every year at the expense of the Colony. One company is told off as gunners, and work the several 7-pounders, &c., receiving extra pay. The drums and fifes are very good; and the buglers it would be hard to beat. The headquarters are at Accra, but there are detachments at all the large stations. One sees the value of the Hausas when they are sent on an expedition, no commissariat or baggage-waggons being required. The men are simply paid 3d. a day as subsistence money, and they find themselves. They are well drilled, and are armed with the Martini-Henry short carbine for bushwork. The whole, or nearly the whole, of the Hausa force are Mohammedans, and their souls are cared for by their priests, who belong to the force, and are paid by the Colony. The men are recruited from the following tribes, viz.: Hausa, Wongora, Dagomba, Meshi, Fulas, Dagotahs, Grunshis, Grumas, and Yombas. The civil police force consists of about 350 men, mostly Fantis. They are in uniform, and perform the duties of policemen, as at home. There are an inspector and two sub-inspectors at the head of the civil police, and the work is carried on as satisfactorily as can be expected out of the material provided.

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Africano (The African Voice), pursued a similar objective as the self-defined guardian of African peasants and workers.

As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

And now I must again complain bitterly of the irregularity and injustice still carrying on at this post-office. The postmaster is a foreigner, of Spanish descent—one of those who have but little or no sympathy with the blacks. When the mail-steamer arrives, and the mail-bags are landed, all and every the Europeans are allowed into the post-office; whereas the poor blacks are kept at an awful distance from the office-door; consequently, some of your subscribers have still to sustain the loss of their papers, which are walked away with by those who are not subscribers at all. Complaint of this has been made, but no redress has been obtained. Again: this post-office ought to be open every day from ten a.m. to three p.m. Instead of this, the post-office only opens on every mail day, and closes two or three hours after the arrival of the mail-bags. Formerly, it was understood that the mails were to be closed twenty-four hours after the arrival of the mail-steamer at Bathurst; but it is quite the reverse now. As evidence: in August last the mail arrived from the coast at twelve noon, and was closed at two p.m. of the same day; last month from the coast, arrived at ten a.m., and closed at two p.m. of the same day; this month she arrived from England on the 6th at twelve noon, and was closed at three p.m., notice stuck out at two, say, one hour's notice; and yet the vessel was here until twelve o'clock the next day. Now, then, is this seeking the interest of the public or of the post-office itself? Surely these things ought to be looked into. All I know is that there is something very like embezzlement going on in that post-office as regards the detention of papers, and we look upon you to enforce some order therein in justice to your subscribers. The office certainly could not be kept open every day now, because the postmaster has two appointments; he is acting auditor as well as postmaster. As postmaster he receives 80l. per annum; and this, under the present system, is for attendance two days in a month. I am sorry to say that everybody has to complain of this foreigner appointed as postmaster in the Gambia, and I trust that some steps will soon be taken to ensure a better arrangement in this office.—I am, Sir, yours truly,\n\n**Gambian.**\n\nWe have also received copy of a Memorial addressed to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which Charles Bates prays that inquiry may be made into the cause of his dismissal after forty years' public service. Upon the ex parte statement, we are bound to say that it seems to us great injustice has been done to an old public servant, and we are sorry to learn\n\nthat Colonel D'Arcy, the Governor, refused to forward the Memorial to the Colonial-office.""}, {'id': 1490, 'article_title': 'NOTICES', 'full_section_title': 'NOTICES', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1868#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_12_1868', 'content': 'We think we are justified in telling our subscribers that, although our accounts for the African Times for the current year (to say nothing of arrears) were sent to the Coast in July last, we have not yet received enough to pay for the stamps used in forwarding the subscribers\' papers since that period.\n\nComplaints have reached us of the undue detention of the letters arriving at Fernando Po for the coloured traders, by the person who is entrusted by H.B.

What will the plea of a defendant avail, where the plaintiff sits on the bench as commissioner? How, and in what way, can a prisoner expect justice, where he is to be tried by the complainant? How, then, can justice be pursued in such court, where the plaintiffs and complainants, or their clerks, are to sit on the bench as magistrates and commissioners, to decide upon their own suits or charges? Here are three among the many great obstacles which stand in the way of justice in the Gambia court, and unless they be removed, things will never get on well in the colony, as you and Christian England would wish. I have twice had to appease attempts of mutiny in the said court, all from the same complaint of injustice.\n\nThe Gambia Court requires a paid magistrate, one who is independent of both black and white, but who will seek the interest of his employer, and the welfare of Her Majesty\'s colony. To secure justice, England must do away with the merchants and their clerks in the court, as they are not seeking the interest of the colony, but their own. And if this be continued, it will ultimately end with disgrace, and the downfall of a long-standing British colony.

But there is something yet required to be done, which I suggest will make great improvement in this small colony—that is, to reduce some of the large expenditure of the several departments. For instance, say the Secretary\'s department for one; five offices (including the Collector of Custom\'s branch) and the hire of the building cost 2,080l. a year (not including the subordinates). Really, you will agree with me that it is rather exorbitant for the part keeping up of only one department per annum in so small a colony as the Gambia; and more so, as the five officers are not all Europeans, who have received a sound English education, but mere boys, who even have not completed their African schooling.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-14', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_10_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GAMBIA AUTHORITIES AND HOSPITAL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We have again a mass of correspondence on the subjects of the Gambia authorities and the Colonial Hospital.

If the person who holds the illustrious position of magistrate, or judge, or Government adviser at the Gambia do not consider himself paid well enough, let him seek promotion in some other colony, but seeking increase of salary in the Gambia, at the sacrifice of the independence he should at least pretend to maintain, is, to say the least of it, bad taste.—Yours obediently,\n\nA GAMBIA CREOLE.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RIVER GAMBIA COLONY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'When an editor sets honestly about the correction of abuses that may have become strong by time and impunity, his path must necessarily be a thorny one. A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

But this officer was too weak a man to be sent to cope with the savage tribes that surround McCarthy's Island; added to which, he was a native of Sierra Leone, while all his predecessors had been natives of the United Kingdom. Now this may seem a small matter to us, but to the savage native it means a great deal. Mark the result! Mr. Smith was not long there before the natives remarked that as he was only a black man, like themselves, he was of little consequence. And he not having force of character to overawe them, they treated him with scant respect. He then proceeded to make some new local regulation, which turned out to be illegal, and several of the inhabitants of the island were punished. They complained to his Excellency the Administrator here, but he hushed the matter up. The only thing that prevented these people bringing the matter into the Courts here, and suing Mr. Smith, was the want of money to fee lawyers and pay the expenses of witnesses from McCarthy's Island. So the Commandant escaped. Then crime became very rife. Natives crossed over from the mainland, and committed robberies on the island, and stole people away to sell them as slaves. Next a canoe, manned by natives from Sucottah, coming up the river, when opposite to the island, fired at a man who was collecting palm-nuts from a palm-tree close to the water, and brought him down like a partridge, dead. This was a mere case of savage devilment or mischief. Now the shot being fired from the river, which is British waters, the murder came within the jurisdiction of the authorities at McCarthy's Island; but they did nothing—did not even try to follow the canoe. Then a woman, a native of McCarthy's Island, was attacked on the mainland, within a couple of miles of the island, brutally ill-used, and died from her injuries.

To this end it is to be expected that those who are appointed to positions of trust and responsibility should have the qualifications necessary to discharge their duties, so that they may inspire trust and confidence in those over whom they are placed. When any suspicion is harboured as to the competency of a functionary for advancing the condition of the people, distrust will be the consequence. No effort should be spared, therefore, to secure men of superior caste to displace those sinecurists and pluralists who are preying on the vitals of these benighted possessions.

Not only are the Gambians unable to assert their rights, but, not being acquainted with the arcana of the Colonial Office, they are afraid to make any representation which is opposed to the acts of that office.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

The traders were, at first, not permitted to establish stations on land, and had to live in hulks (roofed-over ships) moored permanently on the river as houseboats and offices. They tried to exercise some influence through the trusts or credits they gave to Efik traders; and sometimes used economic sanctions by collectively suspending trade with any defaulting Efik merchant. But when, in the nineteenth century, the Efik began to quarrel among themselves, the traders came in as arbitrators and kingmakers.\nMissionaries of the Church of Scotland Mission reached Calabar in 1846. They formed a little self-governing colony of five to six white missionaries, teachers, staff, and converts, at Duke Town and Creek Town. The mission station served as a sanctuary for refugees from the community. But the missionaries also watched the local scene, and reported develop› ments to the British consul, or tried to exercise moral influence and to intervene in other ways.\nSince the Cross river estuary was so accessible to the British Preventive Naval Squadron at Fernando Po, it was comparatively easy to stop the slave trade at Calabar. In 1842, an abolition treaty was signed and an annual subsidy was agreed to be paid to the rulers of Calabar.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs.

The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.593, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Peoples and states of the Great Lakes region', 'section_title': 'Coercion, violence and the market', 'content': 'The effects of resistance to the almost insatiable demands of the larger states in the Lakes region in the nineteenth century included the decline of productivity in nearby tributary areas and the consequent shift back to the courts of some of the costs of surplus production of foodstuffs - since more elaborate means had to be evolved to maintain the high levels of tribute from beyond the regular producing areas within the existing domains.

These towns in the ground-nut season generally give from 120,000 to 140,000 bushels of ground-nuts. The paths are now closed, and the people in the interior are afraid to come down. Before these wars a large quantity of ivory and gold formed part of the trade in this island, but now they are not to be seen; and although there is a sort of peace made between the two tribes, yet still they are not on visiting terms, and marks of deadly hatred are sometimes manifested which will sooner or later break out into open war; in fact, both parties are now only afraid of our Government, as the Governor has made them to understand that the first party who takes up arms will have the British to contend with as well as his native enemies.*\n\nYou will hear from me again about these tribes.""}, {'id': 4444, 'article_title': 'Trade in the Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'Trade in the Gambia', 'last_edit_date': '04-09-1882', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1882#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_06_1882', 'content': 'Sir,—We have good news from Baddiboo, the country on the opposite side of the river to this.

All the towns here were warned yesterday, and are preparing for war. If they act quickly, and attack Tody Cubba at once, and force him to fight with his rear resting on the Creek, he will either be crushed or will have to retreat across the Creek with heavy loss; but if they delay, and take days to “talk” over the matter of war, as these natives are prone to do, and they give Tody a week or so to secure his position, he will do that so well—as he has done before—that they will be unable to drive him out, and this country will be the scene of a war that may last until the country is exhausted and ruined as the Jolah country has been.\n\nReally, the Government should intervene with this man; he has been the terror and ruin of most of the countries on the left bank of the river for many years, and our Government have looked on.'}]","[{'document_title': 'BRASS RIVER.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Our accounts from this river are not such as we should like to receive, but such, we fear, as we shall never cease to receive until something like civilized rule be introduced.

He said he was ready to hear any complaints and suggestions that might be made and invited the various chiefs to speak out their minds fully, frankly, and freely. Possibly, when the Consul did this, he hardly knew what was in store for him, and what a wide field he had opened up, because ever since he has been sitting *de die in diem*. Complaints and mutual recriminations have been rife, allegations have been freely preferred, and often as frankly admitted, of the most horrible crimes, and the proceedings have been a record generally of murder and villainy of every description. However, patience and an enforcement—strictly necessary when one chief brought up a dispute thirty-three years old—of the statute of limitations have at length completed the charges and counter-charges, and the Consul has at length been enabled to give his decision. He certainly showed he was in earnest on the first day of the palaver by fining each of the chiefs half a puncheon of palm oil (equivalent to £5), because their canoes made a row alongside the gunboat. He has now formed a ""constitutional government,"" consisting of the three most powerful chiefs, whom he holds responsible for the administration of the Bonny territory; he has severely fined numerous of the offending chiefs, and has given directions, under a heavy penalty, for the payment of the debts owing by the chiefs to the traders, which in this river amount to some thousands of pounds sterling. It is to be hoped that after this the trade of this river, which has for some time past been yearly retrograding, will show signs of improvement. Formerly Bonny used to be emphatically *the* oil river, but latterly, year by year, its export of that commodity has been diminishing, whilst that of all the other rivers has been increasing. It is an extraordinary fact that, as the price of palm oil has been diminishing month by month, the produce of it has been increasing. This simply arises from the fact that the African is too lazy to work more than is absolutely necessary to obtain what he requires, or thinks he requires. Consequently, as the value obtained in kind for a puncheon of palm oil has diminished, he brings more oil to market to obtain an equivalent supply of gin, gunpowder, clothes, &c., to what he previously received, and so the very proceeding which arises in the first instance from a lowering in the price of the oil at home has a tendency to still further decrease prices by glutting the market.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE GOVERNMENT OF THE OIL RIVERS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'We may remind your Lordship that the commodities obtained from the Oil Rivers District are almost exclusively palm oils and kernels, partly collected near the coast, but mainly brought from the interior by native dealers, who act as intermediaries between the producers and the agents of mercantile houses in Europe. These dealers, under chiefs who exercise certain sovereign powers, have a long-established right, fully recognised by the natives of Africa and in accordance with local institutions, to command the roads and water-ways, and to levy tolls, or appropriate to themselves profits, on all goods conveyed from the interior to the coast. The system may be open to objection, and it may be to the advantage of all concerned that the action of the intermediaries or ""middlemen"" should be carefully controlled. In so far as a prosperous future for this part of Africa, under civilising influences, is to be hoped for, we believe that it can only be secured by developing the resources of the interior, which are at present very inadequately utilised, and by improving the means of communication between it and the coast. We are persuaded, however, that neither substantial gain to European commerce nor anything but disaster to the natives can be looked for from continuance of the present policy of alternately bribing and coercing the intermediary tribes, with frequent imposition of arbitrary fines by her Majesty\'s Consul at Old Calabar, and occasional resort to such more violent expedients as the expatriation of King Ja Ja. We would urge that it is a primary condition of real and lasting commercial success that the intermediary tribes should be equitably dealt with.\n\nWe may also remind your Lordship that the principal commodities now imported into this part of West Africa, in return for the oil and nuts collected for conveyance to Europe, are arms and munitions of war, and inferior and poisonous alcoholic liquors, especially the latter. The fighting materials are largely used by the natives who procure them in internecine wars. The alcoholic liquors further debase those who consume them, and are the source of most grievous obstacles to the industrial and commercial progress of the country, besides causing appalling evils among people whose moral advancement and social well-being it should be the duty of Europeans, professing to be pioneers of civilisation and Christianity, to promote. The evils that we deprecate, and that we cannot doubt are as much deprecated by your Lordship as by ourselves, are increasing every year.

Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers. Even then the State could not leave them in peace; they heard that they came over at night to their old homes to get food, and they stationed canoes and lay in wait for them, with orders to shoot all they caught, and to my knowledge they shot seven people in one night. The State is strong enough to-day to do these things because the people lack unity. They have no leaders, no common cause, and no weapons to fight.

The statement of these men is somewhat alarming, and presents a new feature in the history of plunder and brutal treatment to persons which from time to time are reported to us as taking place on that river. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Towards the latter part of March last, Sallah, Corveh, and Siamah, traders, left Hortey, a small town in the vicinity of Quittah, under passport from the Government officer there, to proceed with three canoes, loaded with salt and cowries, to the Volta, bound for Salagha; on their way they landed at Engabee, a small town on the margin of the Volta, belonging to Dagado, King of Panto, in the Crepee country; and whilst in this place, a number of Houssa men, armed with guns, spears, bows, and arrows, having their drums beating, and headed by one Otuman Katto, came there; Otuman Katto then made them to understand, through the head men of Engabee, that he was authorized by his Excellency the Governor, by King Dagado, and by King Quajoe Dey, to prevent Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos going to Salagha; and that King Dagado and King Quajoe Dey having obtained the sanction of the white men to put to death all Ahwoonahs and Acquamoos who may come to their country, Sallah and his companions are to consider their heads as forfeited. At his command, these men were at once seized by the Houssas, and their hands held fast behind them to be bound, when the head men and people of Engabee interceded; a price was then set on them, and the sum of 330 heads of cowries, equal to 16l. 10s. sterling money, was paid to Otuman Katto, who then ordered them to return to their country. Such is the statement of these men. The Acquamoos men who were amongst them have also been plundered; but, for want of space, we are obliged to pass over that subject for the present. The question naturally presents itself, how long will such a state of things be allowed to continue in the Volta, and whether the Executive authorities on the Coast would not help to remove this evil in the way of trade?\n\nKing Dagado's territories are, in fact, not within the limits of the Protectorate, and the authorities on the Coast may be excused for taking no cognizance of offences which are committed in places beyond their jurisdiction; but the boldness and frequency with which these offences occur in the Volta, and the evil effects this may have on the trade there, demand the sympathy and interference of the authorities, for these offences are committed always by persons from the Coast, without the participation of the native chiefs."", 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1882#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.586, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE ""PACIFICATION"" OF THE OIL RIVERS DISTRICT.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The African Steamship Company's steamer Benin, recently arrived at Liverpool with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa and the Canary Islands.

Stuart & Douglas's agent at Opobo to that firm in Liverpool. The boom which the natives had erected across one of the creeks, and which was really the cause of the blockade, had been removed before the Benin left. No trade was being done in Opobo town itself, but the traders who went up to the inland markets had commenced business as usual. Only one war-ship, her Majesty's ship Peacock, was in the river when the Benin left, the Bramble and Pheasant having left previously.\n\nThe British & African Co.'s Sherbro' brought still later information from the same district, and by this we learn that by order of the Consul the natives were to deliver their war-canoes on the wharf of Messrs. Stuart & Douglas, and this was done in nearly every case. Some of the natives, however, after bringing in their war-canoes, repented doing so, and when night came on they went to the wharf to take the canoes away. On three occasions this was done successfully, but the natives had not got far away when the electric search-light was thrown on the river. They were challenged by those on board the warship, but not stopping, shots were fired into the canoes, which were sunk. It is said that by this means eighteen natives lost their lives. The remainder succeeded in making their escape by swimming.\n\nFrom Bonny we have a terrible tale of massacre and cannibalism among the interior natives. It seems that about last November some Ibos came to trade with the Creekas, the latter inviting them to land, and on doing so were set upon and 136 of them killed.

At their ju-ju house the head men held a festival, where the flesh of the victims was devoured. Some of it was salted and dried to be eaten at leisure.

Here he took possession of the oil markets, and blockaded the creeks, and by these means put a stop to all traffic. Negotiations were in progress for the settlement of the dispute, but it was feared the outbreak would prove a serious matter; and in the event of hostilities taking place, it was anticipated that they would become general, for in Opobo and Bonny both sides would find sympathisers who would render active assistance.

The trouble occurred at Opobo, near Bonny river, and, notwithstanding the presence in the river of H.M.S. Bramble since September last, the chiefs have thrown a boom across the river to oppose the passage of steamboats belonging to the traders. The cause of their defiant action is easily understood. They occupy a commanding position in the river, and being possessed of thousands of men and arms to man their canoes, they are a dangerous enemy. Originally the traders purchased the produce of the interior entirely from them, but of late years have sent their steamboats higher up the river to buy at first cost. Hence their determination to prevent the traders passing through their territory. Major Macdonald, who had been sent from England as Commissioner, arrived off Opobo in the Pheasant, on March 3, immediately after the arrival of Admiral Wells in the Raleigh. The Bramble came out of the river to join the flag, and next morning was under weigh, the Admiral shifted his flag to the Pheasant, and, with the Commissioner, proceeded up the river, where they were met by Consul Hewett, from Bonny.

They surrounded the factory on the beach, all the men being in ambush. They remained in hiding all night, and between seven and eight o'clock the next morning several of them put off to the hulk lying in the river for the ostensible purpose of trading with those on board. Mr. Lowe and Mr. Samuels were on board the hulk, and after some bargaining the former went into the store to get some articles to barter with. Soon after he left, the natives knocked Samuels overboard, and as he rose to the surface they struck him with pieces of wood until he was dead. There were a number of Kroo labourers on board, and, as soon as they saw the turn matters had taken, they jumped into the water, swam ashore, and made off. One or two, however, had attempted to prevent the murder of Mr. Samuels, and these were killed. Mr. Lowe, on leaving the store and making his way to the hulk, was shot in the side.

The trade flourished, and Ja Ja was respected for his fair dealing and his great ability to govern his own people. Meanwhile, treaties of friendship had been made, courts of equity had been established in the various stations; regulations for trade, customs, and other subjects of interest were decided, the British Consul inspecting the proceedings from time to time. Of late years there has been a growing inclination on the part of the traders to establish themselves up the rivers at the interior oil markets, so dispensing with the services of the coast tribes. In Opobo this movement was resisted by Ja Ja, for the reason that the welfare of his people depended upon their employment as middlemen, and as no customs would be paid on the produce bought by the Europeans. He was last year accused of obstructing the Europeans from proceeding to the interior, at the time that his son was in England complaining that the Europeans were invading his markets. Ja Ja was made prisoner by Consul Johnstone, and carried off to Accra. An inquiry was held at Accra upon the charges brought against Ja Ja, and the Admiral holds that they are mainly proved; and Ja Ja is deposed, and will not be allowed to return to the Opobo river.

Whether things will remain as they now are is the doubtful point; pretexts for occupation are so easily found when wanted that it would be rash to answer. Some tribe is reached who cannot understand dual control; they insist on customs, perhaps; are ""chastised"" by the Consul; they retaliate, and finally an occupation is proclaimed.

In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town.

Instead, its fundamental objective was to end British colonialism in this African region. Moreover, it now extended to groups whose earlier attitudes, though aloof and suspicious, had not been systematically hostile to colonial rule. Above all, it represented an enormous increase in the scale of activity in which the Dinka and Nuer, the two largest ethnic groups in this region, were particularly active. They ignored their usual local distinctions and concentrated their resistance under emergency leaders, some of whom were religious leaders - often charismatic 'prophets'. Of this major wave of resistance two risings deserve particular attention: the Aliab Dinka uprising (1919-20) and the Dinka revolt (1927-8). African traditional religion affected the nature of these revolts. But, in addition, neglect as much as oppression had stung the Aliab Dinka into open revolt in 1919.\nThe immediate cause of the first uprising was the malpractices of the Aliab's immediate colonial administrator, the ma'tnür, particularly his extortion of cattle and women. This uprising seemed to have been part of a master plan in which other southern Sudanese peoples were involved. 26 While the Bor Dinka were only with difficulty restrained from rising in support of the Aliab, the Mandari, a completely separate non-Dinka people, actually joined them in this uprising. 27 The Aliab Dinka uprising began on 30 October 1919, when a force of about three thousand warriors attacked the police station at Minkamman south of Sobat river. The station itself was overwhelmed by the Aliab, though the ma'tnür managed to escape. Two days later, a group of Mandari entered a telegraph linesmen's zariba at Mulla, killed three of its men and carried off their guns.

At another time, he would ally with Muslims against Catholics or Protestants or both depending on who he thought was dangerous to his rule. Thus, Mwanga was adept at the diplomatic game of divide and rule, a tactic which the colonizing powers were able to use so effectively in controlling Africa. When it was necessary, Mwanga resorted to a revival of some old tradition in an attempt to drive out all foreigners as happened in 1888.$^{30}$ On this occasion, he intended to entice all foreigners and their Baganda followers to a naval parade on an island on Lake Victoria. There he would leave them to starve to death. It seems to have been a tradition of Baganda kings to carry out naval exercises on the lake. Mwanga sought to do this as a trick to drive out foreigners. However, the plan was leaked to the foreigners who then staged a coup, deposed Mwanga and put his brother on the throne as a kind of a puppet ruler.

But Christianity, like Islam, made little impression on the mass of the Kamba. What made visible inroads into Kamba society was colonialism as a political and an economic force. During the first two decades of this century, the colonial situation produced a widely-felt sense of deprivation and frustration among the Kamba masses as the colonial authorities campaigned to appropriate Kamba resources in the form of taxes, land and labour, using their newly appointed chiefs who had very little regard for traditional authority. The pre-capitalist social institutions for conflict resolution were rendered irrelevant for the purposes of restraining these chiefs and their policemen. As the masses got more and more disillusioned they resorted to religious movements for succour and as vehicles for protest. These movements manifested themselves in prophets and spanned the period between 1910 and 1922. A widespread cult, Kathambi or Ngai, had emerged in Machakos district between 1901 and 1911, promising an imminent millennium.

He seems to consider that the chief Mahabah is performing a duty which the Government neglected to do, and for doing which it envies the man who is really performing very important public services, and preparing the way for the progressive civilization of the country. That man, Mahabah, he says, is not seeking his own interests only, but that of all British subjects. British merchants have been without any real, efficient protection in the river of late years, and Mahabah has made a vast improvement in this respect during the last 24 months. It is true, he proceeds, that, partly owing to the war, and partly to the famine that prevailed during the rainy season, there has been a great deficiency of produce, ""but it is far better to prepare the ground before sowing seed, than to sow it in unprepared soil."" The Pagsoos, in this river, are a people that do not work, but who go about plundering those who do work; pillaging the merchants and traders, and committing many other and great enormities. They are, in fact, a lazy, predatory, and degraded people. The late war between the British and Badiboo was caused by such deeds as are above alluded to. The British effected really nothing, but Mahabah has made an entire change. These people, before so troublesome, having been brought by him under subjection, are now learning to depend on their own labour for the means of support; so that British merchants, who previously scarcely dared to commission any traders in that part, have now been able to find employment as traders there for those who have been (so arbitrarily, as he contends) dismissed from the Government service.'}, {'id': 1114, 'article_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1867#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_05_1867', 'content': ""The political horizon of British Gambia is by no means in a satisfactory state; clouds are gathering from a quarter which ordinary men regard as a menace to the peace of the river.

He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony. What was the *casus belli*?\n\nThe ostensible cause of this warlike and menacing attitude was, that a woman with a few children* availed themselves of Mahba's temporary absence from his capital, and made their escape to the British town of Bathurst. He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda.

Hutton, to try to prevent our stores being robbed, but he (Beram) had left with his banditti, having previously looted Jarcotta. Our agent informed us that Beram had come over suddenly with a force of robbers numbering about 2,000, including 500 horsemen, and had taken the town. The people and farmers fled in a body, leaving their crops and all they possessed. I should mention that as the Government did nothing to stop the former raids of Beram, I went to remonstrate with him last January at Cowar; but, notwithstanding this, our agent only escaped with his life and by surrendering about £150 of goods; but we shall never receive a penny of the heavy credits he had, as customary, given out to the farmers, as all had been ruthlessly plundered and their crops destroyed. Beram also looted and utterly destroyed Barracounda, another flourishing town near Jarcotta.

The raids are said to have been made by the warriors of Chief Beram Cissey, who himself headed the marauders. The first descent was made on the town of Jayed, a place about 300 yards from the River Gambia. After plundering the place the invaders set it on fire. As many as could fled from the city, but several fell into the enemy's hands, including five subjects of British Bathurst. The persons taken were led away into captivity. All the establishments of the traders were plundered and much booty obtained. The fugitives fled towards the River Gambia, and many of them were here picked up by a trading cutter. The poor people were almost naked when found on the banks of the river. The town of Toro was also destroyed by Cissey and his followers. It was stated that the interior of the country had been in a disturbed state for some time, war raging incessantly between the rival chiefs until the belligerents had gradually come to the sea-board. Some of the chiefs, it is said, received annuities from the British Government, with which they are stated to have purchased ammunition to carry on the hostilities. It appears that these troubles had arisen in the kingdom of Badaiboo. We hear that on the death of King Maba, his son, Saida Matee, should have succeeded to the throne, but his authority was usurped by his uncle, Mahmoud Derry Bah, the Regent. Civil war ensued, with the result that Saida Matee was defeated. The fugitive Prince after burning and laying waste all his domains in his flight has, it is supposed, gone to seek the aid of Latjore the deposed Monarch of Cayor, who has nevertheless a number of followers, and a severe struggle for supremacy may be expected, the power of Said Matti being crippled but not destroyed. What is most surprising in the flight of Said Matti is the celerity with which he made his retreat out of the kingdom without even a battle to decide his fate. It is supposed, however, that at the most critical moment he was deserted by his most powerful vassals who it is reported went over to the invaders. And it is quite possible that he may make another effort to recover his lost position. Until lately the action of the Administrator of the Gambia (Captain Moloney) was confined to the giving of good advice and to offers of mediation. When one of Saida Matee's stockaded towns were recently captured, the victors not only burnt the place but pillaged the goods of British subjects, and the latter in consequence fled to Bathurst for safety. The Administrator at once left for the seat of war in the hope of being able to obtain reparation, as well as to prevent all danger of hostilities extending to British territory. The Administrator's mission appears to have been completely successful, as in an interview with Mahmoud Derry Bah he succeeded in extracting from that chief a promise that the claims of the plundered traders should be satisfied.

It is indeed a most compromising position for any person of authority to be placed in. There is a remnant of British prestige here which Governor D'Arcy has on those occasions turned to good account. But no Governor could long make head against the contempt into which any so-called power must necessarily fall when it has none of the elements of power at its command. Fancy an expedition of four or five officials, and a sergeant and half-a-dozen men, sent up the river as an imposing force, for a mediation between chiefs whom we ought to be able to command to obedience and peace! The natives, and especially the wily and enterprising Mohammedan chief, Maba, are laughing at us. We shall soon be objects of extreme contempt.

Up to the time the present administration took charge of the Colony in 1891, things went on pretty satisfactorily. The Revenue was in a flourishing condition. The Colony had a surplus of £25,000 in the hands of the Crown agents. Within the short period of four years, the whole of this amount has been nearly or entirely expended in costly enterprises of no practical utility to the development of the Colony—such as acquiring landed property for £5,000 which could have, if found necessary, been easily procured for £3,000 at the most, and which had been precedently offered to a merchant in the place for £2,500; constructing a pier which cost the Colony about £12,000 for which there was no practical need; conniving at the extravagance of the Engineer's Department by which the Colony was involved in a heavy expenditure for materials, &c., which could not be accounted for; undertaking costly expeditions against Native chiefs which could have been easily avoided, and by which the Colony was in imminent danger of being invaded by Foday Sillah's hordes in 1894, as a consequence of the never-to-be-forgotten Kambojay disaster.\n\n3. Not only have public monies been unadvisedly spent, but the general policy of the administration has been such that the Colony is now seriously compromised in its prosperity, passing through a severe crisis, commercially and financially, such as has never been experienced within the memory of the oldest inhabitants living.\n\n4. The Revenue being very low, taxes, considered burdensome, are imposed to raise money to meet an ever-increasing expenditure.

It was reported more than twelve months ago that the French contemplated an expedition against this chief, which was to be prosecuted in December, 1864. Maba\'s territory being this side on the borders of British ground, and himself being a pest to the traders of both powers, the French authorities of Senegal negotiated with our Government to have joint action in putting down the fanatic Mohammedan chieftain, who had caused so much disturbance in the country. He did not, however, think it proper to undertake an expedition, nor are we so sanguine in our expectation of the benefit that will accrue to our Government, in alliance with the French, in such petty wars; and, therefore, the offers were declined, and the French were allowed to pursue him wherever he goes, were it even on British grounds.\n\nThings stood so for some time, whilst the French were making all due preparation for the intended expedition. Maba, too, was by no means dilatory; he made his preparation by purchasing gunpowder, guns, and materials for making balls, or rather slugs.\n\nIn the beginning of this month the French made a move, having, as it is reported, brought 3,000 regular soldiers and 7,000 native allies; and hitherto they have had a regular fight with Maba, which resulted in his being defeated and losing a large number of men. He was obliged to make his escape on horseback; but he assembled a great number of men and divided them into a right and left wing. The latter he sent against one Mohammedan fanatic, called Seykoo, who is marching from the north-eastern direction against him, and whom Maba had promised to attack this dry season. The French have fought with and taken three stockaded towns, and driven these Marabouts from their kingdom at Saaloo; Maba fled to Cower, where he remained for a few days, and has now returned to his shattered army, and to reinforce them with new recruits.\n\nOne accident has, however, happened to the French, on which Maba and his army gloried a great deal. A provision and ammunition waggon party, whilst passing through the bush, came on the path of Maba\'s army. They were but lightly guarded, and Maba made an easy capture of it, appropriated the mules and horses to his own use, and shot the two officers who were in command of the convoy.

In 1861 he was an unimportant chief in the kingdom of Baddiboo, against which the last great war expedition of the British authorities in the Gambia was directed. Maba was a bigoted Mahometan, and watching his opportunity, he in 1861 rebelled against the King of Baddiboo, whom he put to death, raising himself to be supreme ruler of Baddiboo. He then declared a propaganda of Mahometanism, which he endeavoured to force by fire and sword in all the adjacent countries. His last recorded exploit was a successful attack upon some 300 French troops (Europeans), who were all slain except nine, the officer in command putting an end to his own existence.\n\nThe last French mail from Senegal brought to Europe the intelligence that this restless and cruel fanatic chief has at last met with the fate he has constantly provoked. He was therein stated to have been taken prisoner in battle by the Joloffe King of Sein, and by him put to death, his head and hands being sent by the Joloffe King to the French Governor of Senegal.\n\nBy the mail of the 2nd inst. from Bathurst we have a confirmation of this important news.

The textbook highlights how colonialism relied on the diffusion of the colonizer's culture through education, creating a new group of educated elites among the colonized who were often relegated to inferior positions compared to their European counterparts. This marginalization led to resentment and agitation against colonial regimes, as colonial strategies dampened the aspirations of the educated elite and fostered conflict between traditional and new elites, with colonial powers positioning themselves as protectors of traditional systems. This manipulation resulted in dissatisfaction among both sets of elites, further alienated by the weakening of indigenous governance systems and the imposition of colonial administrative structures. The colonial system's paternalism and racial discrimination exacerbated the disconnect, as educated Africans were barred from equal participation and faced social exclusion, reinforcing the notion that government and public property belonged to colonial rulers. Similarly, The African Times articles provide concrete examples of this disconnect, such as the absence of native chiefs at official ceremonies, dissatisfaction among native communities like the Fantees, and the indignation of chiefs at being summoned without proper communication. The articles also highlight the lack of consultation with native members of the Legislative Council, the disregard for native petitions, and the imposition of colonial policies without regard for local customs, all of which intensified tensions.

This is usually provided through a diffusion of the culture of the colonizer through education. Attainments within the educational system established for this purpose provide the yardsticks for raising a new group of elites among the colonized society. However, the diffusion of the imported culture of the colonizer almost invariably involves not only harmonious culture contacts, but also culture conflicts, which could find expression in violent reactions from the subject people. Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.589, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere. The African masses were primarily recognized as the 'black problem' and were, as Jabavu described them, 'landless, voteless, helots, pariahs, social outcasts in their fatherland with no future in any path of life'.$^{14}$ Further- more, these were the first Africans to face the crisis in identity$^{15}$ created by new artificial colonial boundaries which partitioned cultural-linguistichistorical groups, by cultural shock in mining and farming compounds, the homes of the whites, and in Christian churches and schools throughout the settler-dominated world."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""Because of their exclusion, the new elites went into open opposition against the colonial powers.

In any case if they accepted the arguments of the new elites, they would be consigning themselves to second or even third place.

The new elites said they did. This the traditional rulers denied, claiming the honour for themselves. The colonial administration agreed with them. The kind of acrimony which this disagreement at times generated could be seen in the dispute between the chief of Akyem-Abuakwa in the Gold Coast, Nana Sir Ofori Atta and the leaders of the National Congress of British West Africa in the 1920s.

The nature of the relationship varied both in place and time. In the French territories neither the new elites nor the traditional rulers flourished under alien rule.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

They related to the social innovations that colonialism had introduced into the Somali social fabric. Colonial forces had, in fact, destroyed the traditional social and political institutions and imposed their own. They introduced in all parts of Somalia a centralized system of administration that vested all effective powers in the hands of colonial administrators, and gave no Somali any position of command except at the very lowest level. Colonial appointed chiefs, known as akils in the British Protectorate and capos in Italian-ruled Somalia, operated in an advisory capacity only, and as vehicles for colonial directives to the people. This was indeed a wide departure from the traditional free local institutions and the nomadic way of life to which the Somali people were overwhelmingly dedicated. With their fierce sense of independence and traditional disdain for all foreign elements, especially white Christians, the Somali people were bound to resist this radical innovation.\nBefore the colonial era, the Somali were not subject to government imposts other than qadi fees and import and export duties. But the colonial powers campaigned to mobilize and exploit all Somali resources - human and material - using their newly-appointed chiefs who had no regard for traditional authority. Direct taxes were instituted for the first time in Somaliland. While in Italian Somalia this took the form of an annual hut tax, in the Protectorate the British imposed taxes on lifestock. Moreover Somali labour was forcibly recruited for colonial enterprises. The French recruited 2000 Somali to work for them as manual labourers during the First World War. Of these, 400 were killed and another 1200 were wounded.$^{32}$ Italian administrators sent out frequent expeditions to provide the required labour for their plantations in Somalia. These Somali recruits were grouped according to their ethnic origins and forced to live in colonial villages on the consortiums.

The outcome was agitation to get back lost lands or to be allowed to rejoin kinsmen in a different location. The Somali people had often resisted this colonial demarcation of the frontiers by force. The joint Anglo-Ethiopian commission that was sent in 1932 to fix the Protectorate's boundary, for example, encountered violent opposi› tion from the clansmen in the area, and its officer in charge was killed. 43 These local risings against colonial rule in Somaliland were limited in scope and nature.

Never was there a more respectable educated jury empanelled on the Gold Coast. The case lasted five days, and at the end Mr. Chief-Magistrate Chalmers addressed the jury as if he were counsel for the prosecution. However, the jury were men of truth, and unanimously acquitted the prisoners. To describe the excitement that followed would be impossible. It came out in evidence that the first search-warrant issued by Mr. Chalmers had neither date nor seal, and the attorney for the prisoners made a good point of this great default; but Mr. Chalmers told the jury that it was perfectly in order; that as he had issued it from the Judicial Assessor's Court these mistakes or omissions did not signify, since he could do what he liked in that court; and that Governor McClean established a precedent to back up his ruling. Poor Fynn, his son, and Forson were kept in a beastly gaol for ten days. The so-called Colonel Foster-Foster, police magistrate, and prosecutor in this case, refused bail in 1,000l. for Fynn's and his fellow-prisoners' appearance; and at the trial they were honourably acquitted.

Foster could not find them. Salmon got in a rage, and ordered him to go again—hence all the trouble. Now what right had Mr. Salmon, as Administrator, to interfere in judicial matters?

To satisfy you that Lord Kimberley\'s excuse as to his illness is no excuse at all, permit me to state that the petition was returned to the Acting Commandant on the 27th February, for him to make his remarks thereon; and there were several queries written in the margin in pencil, in the handwriting of Mr. Chalmers, who stated that he was acting for the Administrator. The Acting Commandant was directed to report fully on all the questions involved, and his attention was particularly called to the paragraph wherein allusion was made by the kings and chiefs to the defenceless and dilapidated state of the three Accra forts. Several persons here saw the petition after it was sent back to the Acting Commandant, and also the pencil remarks in Mr. Chalmers\' hand, on the 27th February; that is, just seven days after the king sent it in to the Commandant to be forwarded to Colonel Harley.

There was then no one ready to step into his place. It is true that on the last and biggest day of King A.\'s funeral solemnities the young man then called Prince Duke was, in the presence of all the head men of the town, the representatives of the neighbouring districts, and most of the European traders, presented to our late esteemed Consul Hopkins as King-elect of Duke Town; but several of the influential families of the town seemed disposed to contest his claim, and so, at an after convention, a sort of compromise was made by the appointment of a Regency, with a quiet gentleman, of the name of Efi Watt, as its nominal head. It was found, however, after some months\' trial, that the Regency system would not work. As of old, in a certain country lying north-east from us, ""when there was no king, every man""—every freeman or gentleman—""did that which was right in his own eyes.""\n\nWhen the Consul and the Commodore came here on special business in the month of March last, it was felt that the want of a responsible head in the country was a great hindrance to the proper transaction of public international business.\n\nThe Acting Consul spent a few days of last month on a visit to the river, and on the morning of the last day of his visit, Saturday, April 17, some of us were startled by receipt of an official notice, ""On Her Britannic Majesty\'s Service,"" intimating that Prince Duke was to be crowned King of Duke Town, at 12 o\'clock noon, on the hulk Matilda. This was so utterly unlike all former coronations which we have seen or heard off here, that we could only conclude that the Consul must have been acting under special instructions from the Foreign Office. The ceremony, such as it was, took place in the presence of a select few. Most of the European traders were present, but comparatively very few of the natives. No representative of the mission was present. The senior brother had a notification of what was to take place, but as it was not accompanied, as on former occasions of the same kind, by a request to conduct a suitable religious service, he thought it better not to be present. It was so far satisfactory to learn that the new King, who is styled **King Duke Ephraim Eyamba IX.**, signed an agreement binding him to observe the various treaties which have been made between British functionaries and his predecessors.'}, {'id': 5739, 'article_title': 'Popular Aspirations on the Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Popular Aspirations on the Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_09_1888', 'content': 'A small Parliamentary paper recently issued contains reports from the Governor of the Gold Coast Settlements to Lord Knutsford on a tour made by the former in the eastern districts of his government. In the various places to which he went Sir B. Griffith collected around him native chiefs and merchants, in order to hear from themselves their views and wishes. At Pram Pram, the King, an old man, wanted nothing save to be allowed to revive an old custom, part of which consisted in the exhumation of the dead. At Quetta the chiefs and people said they had nothing to say about the state of the district of his Excellency, but they did desire that the duty on spirits, which had been lowered experimentally from 2s. 6d. to 1s. a gallon, might be lowered still further to 6d. a gallon; they were glad that the *ad valorem* duties were abolished, and complained that traders were molested on one of the roads. The Governor told them he was determined to stop the smuggling of rum, and advised them to cultivate cotton. The desired remission in duty on spirits appears to have been refused. The Afflowho chiefs were also warned against smuggling, and told the great advantages of growing cotton. At Big Awoonah the chief sent a friendly message, which the Governor acknowledged with a present of half a sovereign and two bottles of champagne. At Addah there was an important meeting; the people there wanted a road to the beach, a school, stipends to the chiefs, the reduction of the duty on rum to 1s. a gallon, wells, a public bell to mark the time, a free ferry across the Volta River, and a warehouse on the beach. To these the Governor replied that he would help them to make the road, but they must help themselves; that he could not see why they wanted a school, seeing that they had already two, of which they did not avail themselves; he could not promise them stipends or reduce the rum duty; they would have their bell, and would be shown how to sink wells; the ferry would be considered, and they could not want a warehouse on the beach. Here, again, smuggling and cotton came up as before. On the following day the chiefs expressed a wish to have another interview with the Governor. They pressed him to reduce the rum duty, and to give them stipends; but after a lengthy discussion the Governor succeeded in sending them away in good humour; but without cheaper rum or the stipends. They did not press him a second time on the school question. At Odumassie the King received the Governor in great state, and, in return, the latter impressed upon his Majesty, his chiefs, and women the importance of cotton, and the advantages of the Basle missionaries. The King begged for a pair of handcuffs to enforce his powers, and a lamp; King Akrobato, whose capital is two hours’ journey from that of the King of Odumassie, also wanted a lamp and handcuffs. At Akropong the King and chiefs gave the Governor the most imposing reception he had had. ""I expatiated as usual upon cotton and cocoa cultivation."" The King said that the cocoa plants the Governor had sent him had all failed; he and his chiefs were anxious to know how they could recover debts due to them, and they also wanted to be paid in cash in place of gin for palm oil. On the whole the situation appears to be this—the Government want the people to grow cotton, cocoa, and coffee, so that they may not be wholly dependent on palm oil; to go to school, not to molest travellers, not to smuggle, and to keep the roads and wells in order. The people do not appear to care about any of these things.'}, {'id': 6865, 'article_title': 'The Memorial of the Native Inhabitants of Lagos to the Colonial Secretary', 'full_section_title': 'The Memorial of the Native Inhabitants of Lagos to the Colonial Secretary', 'last_edit_date': '08-27-1897', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_11_1897#article-6', 'issue_date': '03_11_1897', 'content': 'That the unwarranted apprehension awakened could and would have been easily avoided, if his Excellency had consulted with any one of the many old, tried, faithful and loyal subjects of the Queen in the Colony, who would have been willing and ready to assist his Excellency with any information he might require under the circumstances; or if his Excellency had taken the Native unofficial members of the Legislative Council into his confidence and made known his apprehensions to them.

The Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast, whose principal time ought to be occupied in dealing with matters of Sierra Leone, with which he is directly connected (owing to the additional employment given him, to superintend the affairs of the minor settlements), can scarcely find time to attend to matters connected with his own immediate government with any degree of satisfaction; for when he should be at his seat regulating and adjusting the public machinery of Sierra Leone, he is away to some other place, settling some petty disputes between some petty chiefs—disputes with which he is as incapable of dealing as the Lord Mayor of London. What does the Governor-in-Chief, who resides at Sierra Leone, know of the manners, customs, and habits of the Fantees and Ashantees to qualify him for dealing with matters connected with those tribes? He governs over a people dissimilar in every respect, and is governed only by hearsay information, which is very often at variance with facts. The local administrators who dwell among these tribes, and who have thereby the opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with the laws and customs of these people under their immediate control, ought, if proper care be exercised by the Colonial office in its appointments, to be more competent to adjust matters between them than any governor-in-chief of Sierra Leone, who has come among them on a flying visit, and with no other knowledge than such as he calls on the way. You would perhaps laugh right out if you were told that the King of the Bulloms was authorised to regulate the government of Sierra Leone; but surely this is not more ridiculous than giving the Governor-in-Chief power to meddle in the matters of all the various tribes on the West Coast. The new system, then, is of no practical utility, but rather a great disadvantage to Sierra Leone. There was some hope in the beginning that it would be the means of great improvements, but it has been fairly tried and has failed, sadly failed; and what is left now is that it is necessary to do away with it, and confine every governor to the immediate government of his own colony, and not to allow him to interfere with the affairs of other settlements, which he cannot possibly understand or manage.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.588, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'An Englishman lately returned to England after some years\' residence on the Congo, said with regard to the above interview: While all the cases referred have not come under my personal observation, I regret I am unable to deny the general charges of inefficiency and brutality made against the State officials. The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate.

Neither the merchant, the traveller, nor the missionary may pass through, lest the trade monopoly of the coast natives as middlemen be broken and infringed upon. This is how our enlightened Government fosters civilization. It attempts to rule the natives of West Africa from London, and does so by applying the laws of advanced communities to their case. The consequence is that we are laughed at by the petty tribes, and our Governors compelled, like a lot of old women, to spend their time in endless palavers about the most trivial questions. The rights of the natives must on no account be infringed. Hence, after all these years of occupation, we find ourselves confined to the deadly coast-line, with not the slightest possibility of developing the inland trade. We must be content to wait till it filters through the hands of the surrounding tribes. And now the singular spectacle is presented of a Mohammedan Prince doing from the interior what we ought to have done years ago from the coast. With a huge army, I hear he is moving down towards Sierra Leone, to shake hands with the white man and to break up the cordon which has shut him off from the full benefits of trade.

After a long consideration, this was reluctantly granted, and a girl was sent with her as a spy, to see if she will attend the Sacrament. On this day one of the teachers went to visit her, and asked her what she desired to do. In reply to the teacher, she said, ""I have not thought of anything in this world, for I know the God that delivered those three men from that wicked king of old is with me."" So she went to church and attended the service. The girl that was sent to watch her, went up close to her and whispered, ""Have you commenced again? Do you not fear Ma?"" She replied, ""No; I fear the Great Being, and to Ma Ariah I give the respect due to her."" So the girl left the church, and went and told Ariah, who immediately sent a number of men to seize her as soon as she should leave the church, and put her in chains. But see the works of Providence! One of the very men that was sent to seize her, managed to convey a hint to her that they were lying in wait for her, and enabled her to escape. She is now a fugitive for refuge in the mission hall, and does not dare to approach Duke Town for fear of being seized and ill-treated. They also threatened to burn down her house.

Mr. Smith was not long there before the natives remarked that as he was only a black man, like themselves, he was of little consequence. And he not having force of character to overawe them, they treated him with scant respect. He then proceeded to make some new local regulation, which turned out to be illegal, and several of the inhabitants of the island were punished.

The only thing that prevented these people bringing the matter into the Courts here, and suing Mr. Smith, was the want of money to fee lawyers and pay the expenses of witnesses from McCarthy's Island. So the Commandant escaped. Then crime became very rife. Natives crossed over from the mainland, and committed robberies on the island, and stole people away to sell them as slaves. Next a canoe, manned by natives from Sucottah, coming up the river, when opposite to the island, fired at a man who was collecting palm-nuts from a palm-tree close to the water, and brought him down like a partridge, dead.

Then a woman, a native of McCarthy's Island, was attacked on the mainland, within a couple of miles of the island, brutally ill-used, and died from her injuries. These are some instances of great mismanagement; but now comes one of more general importance. At McCarthy's Island there is a local regulation by which all natives landing there from the mainland have to give up their arms, to be kept in charge at the police-station until their departure; a very good rule, but one that should be executed discreetly.\n\nSome months ago, Prince Moosa, son of Mollo, King of the...\n**111**"", 'last_edit_date': '1880-08-26', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1880#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Condition of the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The heads of expeditions and the District Commissioners must specially watch that their subordinates, to whatever category they belong, employ in their dealings with Natives the tact necessary to avert the conflicts which might arise from misunderstandings or practices conflicting too roughly with the customs and usages of the Natives.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

A correspondent of the Watchman, writing on these events, says:—\n\n""We cannot remember that before 1878 any British subject had been attacked by natives without provocation, except in time of wars, when plunder and rapine are rife. Treaty stipulations with native chiefs provide that they should not lay hands on British subjects or punish them by the laws of their country, but report any grievances to the Governor of Sierra Leone, which is clearly understood by the chiefs and their people; but it should not be a matter of doubt now that those stipulations are disregarded and all manner of violence committed since the following words were publicly expressed to them: \'The people of Sierra Leone are slaves: their ancestors were brought here in ships, when they were packed up as sheep and goats, and landed naked, and one cannot distinguish between man and woman. One who has resided in the rivers knows how low the natives regard their slaves; a bullock is sometimes prized higher than Sierra Leone people are now estimated.\' Again, as regards Scarcies, Mr. George Bright, a native catechist of the United Methodist Free Churches at Kambia, in the above river together, with several other British subjects of this settlement trading there, returned here, three or four days ago, from that place, whence all the Sierra Leone people have been expelled by the chiefs, with threats of an immediate attack, in consequence of the aboriginal disaffection towards them and their Government.

The traders on this river are constantly exposed to great danger and loss owing to this want of Government protection. They are compelled by the chiefs and alcaldes to reside in their towns or stockades with their goods and produce. Formerly they built temporary stores and dwelling-houses at the river side or wharf of their several trading ports, by which they had little comparative risk from fire and native wars, the two chief accidents in this river. Of late that system has been done away with in some localities, through Government mismanagement, and the traders have sustained great losses; their goods and produce have in several places been consumed by fires, with the towns where they were compelled to reside, which would not have been the case had they been allowed to reside at the river side. This year the trade has been so dull, that cotton goods scarcely sold, and the very small portion of produce collected has been ultimately destroyed by fire; some thousand pounds worth at Sanding, some hundreds at Zambakotto, Juronku, Dassilammee, and Secker, and several other places—all by fire.

If there be abuse of power, there is also redress; and public opinion is a power known and felt in British settlements. An officer has only to go beyond his legal powers to find himself reported to his Government, and his doings criticised in your columns, or it may be, in those of the leading papers of your metropolis. Where can such a thing happen with regard to any other colony? The dwellers under British authority no doubt have much to complain of, but they have also very much to be thankful for. Look at us here. Our usual Governor in his own country would doubtless be considered a very ordinary person in his private capacity, but here he has little short of the power of an absolute monarch, and the arrogance of an upstart. Who is there to call him to account? The people are dumb, and through fear of his power to injure them, and being an English-speaking people without sufficient knowledge of their government, are helpless to make their complaints heard. He is his own interpreter of the law, and puts whom he chooses in prison, and sets free at his own sweet will. He is, in fact, the law; and the whole settlement is under his sole and entire control. The government is, in a few words, a naval despotism. Let some of the acts of the present Governor speak for themselves. He personally walked into the Protestant Sunday-school one Sunday afternoon, and demanded of the teachers their authority for holding it, and verbally ordered it to be closed from that day, affirming the said act by a written document afterwards. He has issued orders to stop all public manifestations of worship other than the Roman Catholic. The notice-board had to be removed from the chapel, and the bell to hold its tongue. Not content with this, he closed the Day-school, and compelled all the children to attend the Government School. The missionary's wife has been doing her share of good in teaching a few girls to sew, &c., and thus the endeavour to make better women and better wives of them. This, too, he has stopped; there are to be no more sewing classes. Thus a blow is struck at the liberty of a man's home, and his invitations to that home are liable to be prohibited or permitted at the will of this very parental government, which would go so far as even to pry and interfere in a man's domestic affairs. There is a mission at George's Bay, a place only heard of and visited once every few years by the gunboat, which he probably would not have taken the trouble to have gone near in the interest of trade, or to stop war amongst the natives, or to gain a better knowledge of the people and country he is governing; but, as a doughty son of the Church, he doubtless felt himself urged, without delay, to stop the injury being done by the British heretics at this place, who were busy teaching the natives there to read the Bible, and to become civilized and useful subjects of King Alfonso. So the gunboat was sent, and the school ordered to be closed. He even forbade preaching, but this he afterwards permitted. The arbitrary acts of this man in thus injuring the British Mission here, which has been allowed to do its work by permission of the Government, and has spent a deal of money in houses, &c., on the good faith of the permission granted, will doubtless be the subject of diplomatic correspondence between London and Madrid, so soon as the Consul expected here is in possession of the necessary particulars; but this means a great loss of time, and meanwhile the missionaries, who are here for good, and hitherto doing real good to all, are wasting time and health to no purpose. If the Government approve of the acts of their subordinate, the mission is as good as closed, in which case, no doubt, the money spent on premises will be refunded them. The missionaries are by no means the only people who suffer from the misrule of the present Governor. Nothing is being done towards improving the town. There are still no roads, and no greater knowledge of the inhabitants of this island than that possessed by the first Governor. There is an absence of all governing enterprise beyond the town. The interior resources of the island are as much a mystery to the world as ever. He finds it easier to harass and annoy the people, who, being in the town, he has power over to injure. He is greatly prejudiced against the English, and this will account for the great dissatisfaction his conduct gives to an English-speaking people. He understands English, but no English will he have spoken. People who have aught to say to him, must say it in Spanish. Instances of his injustice are not hard to find. Proved thieves he has allowed to escape without punishment, whilst an innocent girl is suffering imprisonment for a cause which raises the character of that girl to a point worthy of our greatest admiration. There is hardly a man in the town who has not a grievance against him, and, like others before him, the illicit influence of abandoned women helps to govern. Our Governors have an idea that anything they do here, being in such an out-of-the-way corner of the globe, will not reach the ears or eyes of those whose opinions they fear and appreciate. It is time to let them know that such is not the case.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'. In these two major settler colonies, exactly as in all the other colonies in which residential Europeans were to be found, the demographic minority was in fact the political majority, thus precluding any resemblance to democratic government on the European model."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""In theory such indirect administration also applied to French colonial activities south of the Sahara, but in fact practice was at severe variance with it.

Only the commandant du cercle commands; only he is responsible. The native chief is but an instrument, an auxiliary'.$^{14}$ Despite official pronouncements, therefore, the French used indigenous authorities not indirectly, but directly and subordinately in their colonial administration. And in like manner so did the Portuguese.\nLugard's form of indirect rule was initially successful in Northern Nigeria although discredited by some critics as unduly conservative$^{15}$ and was then extended after the war throughout much of British Africa, including the newly acquired German possessions of Tanganyika and the Cameroon. It was even adapted by the Belgians for their use in the Congo after 1920. Although conditions were nowhere else so optimal or the results so successful as in the Hausa-Fulani region of Nigeria, the British did try to follow the contours of local custom so that even newly devised institutions, like local councils, were in consonance with indigenous forms of organization.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute. The universal imposi› tion of European-planned taxes was certainly another disruptive colonial measure, but even the modest efforts made in the direction of what is today called modernization also remoulded local institutions.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained. Most obviously, traditional functions were distended by new demands, such as the collection of taxes, the taking of censuses, or the recruitment of labour and military conscripts. Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated. Then, chiefs were some› times endowed with political significance which had not previously been inherent in their office; on other occasions they were installed in acephalous societies where they previously had no administrative purpose.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony.

The vacillation or weakness of an Executive at such a season might place in jeopardy thousands of innocent lives, and lead to eventual results incalculably more dreadful than the suppressive severities of a firm and decided officer. For let it be supposed for a moment that the allegation of such an intended outbreak in Jamaica is correct—that such an outbreak had been successful—its horrors all enacted, and the island had fallen entirely into the hands of the negro population. Does any man in his senses believe that this country would condone the offence, and allow the guilty island thus to remain, one of the prophesied Confederation of Black Republics of the Antilles?

N. Fowler rose to call attention to the affairs of South Africa, and to move ""That in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that facilities should be afforded by all methods which may be practicable, for the confederation of the colonies and states of South Africa."" The question of confederation had already been discussed in that House, and it had been a great deal discussed in the South African colonies, as was evident from the papers which had been presented on the subject. One question which had created much discussion, and on which the most eminent statesmen of this country had given their opinion, was that if responsible government in the Cape were given, the government should include all the South African colonies, and not alone the government of the Cape of Good Hope. South Africa was now divided into several rival states, and he thought it would conduce much to the interest of all if they were confederated, so as to put an end to rival interests. A strong opinion in favour of confederation was expressed by Governor Sir George Grey fourteen years ago, when he described the unsatisfactory and unsettled state of affairs under the existing system. With regard to Natal, he wished to pay a passing tribute to the native Minister, Mr. Shipstone, to whom the colony and this country were deeply indebted for his exertions in maintaining satisfactory relations with the natives, and he hoped that Her Majesty\'s Government would place that gentleman in a position which would enable him to carry out his views for the improvement of the native races. He trusted also that the Government would give their best attention to the subject of railway communication in that colony. The present roads were mere tracks, and the loss caused by the detention of waggons was very serious. A scheme of railway communication had been proposed by Mr. Welbourne, and it had the support of the Legislative Council and of all the most distinguished men in the colony. With regard to the Orange Free States, he was glad to see from the papers that Her Majesty\'s Government adopted the policy of not permitting interference by any foreign Power on questions affecting these colonies, and he trusted that they would continue to pursue that policy. From a letter which he had received from a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in the colony, he was glad to find that the state of public opinion had much improved there in reference to slavery, the commando system, and wars between the native tribes, to which there was now a greater aversion than there had formerly been. As regarded the diamond fields, the proclamations which had been issued by Sir Henry Barkly, the Governor of the Cape, evinced great wisdom on his part in the settlement of the affairs of that country. There was one point to which attention had been called by Sir Fowell Buxton, and that was the passing at the diamond fields of a very severe resolution, which rendered the purchase of diamonds from the natives punishable with fifty lashes in the public market-place. He trusted that the Government and Sir Henry Barkly would use their best exertions to prevent the infliction of such punishments. With regard to the general question, he was glad to see by the papers that the Government had been giving Sir Henry Barkly their support, and he hoped that they would continue to do so, and that it would be the good fortune of that eminent servant of the Crown to establish in South Africa a system of government similar to that by which our North American colonies had been united.

It has come into a wonderful windfall, and it admits that it has been fortunate. It is not, however, to be denied the credit of having known how to take advantage of its good luck, or to be refused commiseration for various obstacles it has had and has to encounter. Diamond mining is as laborious and complicated as other forms of human enterprise. The search has to be prosecuted as methodically and with as elaborate machinery as if the stones were manufactured in a mill. A million sterling a year is paid at Kimberley in wages, and another million has been invested in engineering appliances. As the work proceeds difficulties multiply. Rocks fall in and bury the precious blue diamond earth. Shafts sunk in the reef, such as are now being projected, will, it is feared, shift the dilemma rather than overcome it. When the diamonds are there, their lawful owners, without whose capital they must have remained buried, cannot be sure of appropriating their value. Native labour has to be engaged for the tedious operations required by regular mining. The Kaffir steals, swallows, or tempts his dog to swallow, a gem which would embellish a King\'s crown. Savage cunning might be tracked and thwarted. The chief danger is that the white community contains a numerous class of receivers of stolen goods. They are the tempters and trainers of the natives to crime; and public opinion condones their treason. The strict search now in practice might be supplemented by walls, or even by the investiture of the workman with wire and goggle masks, as seems to have been proposed. Kaffir susceptibilities are less delicate than those of white labourers. No mechanical precaution would be sufficient unless the pilfering and complicity in the pilfering of diamonds be regarded by Kimberley as absolute theft. Mr. Merriman\'s warning cannot be taken too promptly and deeply to heart by Kimberley opinion. From his words it may be inferred that to ""shoot people carrying diamonds,"" as well as stealing diamonds at the mines, is thought at Kimberley ""a light thing."" As Mr. Merriman truly says, thence to shooting people carrying sovereigns is no very long step. At the only partially enlightened stage to which, we are afraid, the tone of Kimberley public morality has yet attained, an especial aggravation of the wrong inflicted by diamond thieves and receivers appears to be the presumed effect of their depredations on the market price of the goods. Kimberley is not clearly satisfied of the right of the world to snatch an advantage from the bounty of South African diamond mines, and give three-fourths less for its brilliants than it gave before. That, however, Kimberley is conscious, is the way of the world. A clever finder can never double and treble a product without consumers offering lower prices. Kimberley would not have complained very loudly if it believed its diamonds were thus being cheapened by the competition of their rightful proprietors for custom. Its grievance is that criminal purloiners who have given little or nothing for stones can afford to sell them, and actually do sell them, below any reasonable tariff. An annual percentage, ranging from a fifth to a sixth, is computed to be stolen. These stones, thrown upon the market for what they will fetch, are alleged to have forced prices down a tenth or fifteenth below the point they would otherwise have touched.'}, {'id': 5226, 'article_title': 'CHRISTIANITY AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'full_section_title': 'CHRISTIANITY AND THE OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS ON THE GOLD COAST.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1885#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_10_1885', 'content': '\n\nThat the Government of this colony apparently profess to occupy a position of neutrality between the Christian missionary work and the malignant and Satanic attitude assumed against Christianity by the worshippers of the false religions.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs. Although one of the reports said that the Natives would rise against the Germans and drive them out of the river, it was not believed by the English that anything of the kind would be attempted, as the Germans a few years ago gave the Natives a lesson of their strength which they are not likely to forget.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-13', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE RECENT REVOLT IN THE CAMEROONS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In connexion with the recent meeting of the Native police against the German authority in the Cameroons, very serious charges have been made against some of the highest officials in the Colony.

There is certainly a case for inquiry; indeed, the Government has admitted as much, for it has ordered a full investigation into the causes of the revolt. Our own experience in another part of Africa shows that such charges are by no means to be taken as they stand, and that they sometimes lose their worst features when those who make them are put to the proof. The interest that Governments have in probing them to the bottom is by no means merely sentimental.

The depositions of the witnesses, which are now for the first time published in this country, show that indescribable cruelties were committed by these ruffians and their accomplices, among whom, it will be remembered, was the wife of Williams. Two slave girls were subjected to frightful brutalities, although fortunately only one died. They were tied back to back and severely flogged by the man John, and by Mrs. Williams. Then a troop of school children were actually sent for to continue the flogging, and many of the boys, it appears, supplied themselves with sticks from a guava tree, and shamefully beat the poor girls in the presence of the ex-missionaries and their wives. Subsequently they were cruelly tortured with cayenne pepper; one of them—Amé by name—dying in the course of the night, a bottle of rum being given to the man who buried her to bribe him not to tell what had happened. The culprits richly merited the severe sentences which were ultimately passed upon them; but many readers of the Correspondence will be disposed to think that it was a case which called for the infliction of the extreme penalty of the law, at all events against two of the offenders. The prosecution was beset with difficulties, owing to the fact that the outrages were committed in districts beyond British jurisdiction. Ultimately a Commission was appointed under the Great Seal for the trial of the prisoners, but the Commissioners nevertheless describe this machinery as ""cumbrous,"" and as ""extremely difficult in the working.""

In spite of the efforts of the missionaries and the Consul to abolish the cruelties and barbarous practices of the natives there, there are still many of the old customs in vogue. While the Gaboon was in the river, a petty chief, named Bokko, punished one of his slaves by chaining him to a post and brutally cutting off both his ears. The unfortunate slave, after two or three days\' exposure to the sun, with nothing to eat or drink, expired, and was found dead by some of the natives, a pool of blood marking the place of his murder. Bokko was at once arrested by King Adam Archibong, and after several days\' confinement was fined sixty boxes of brass rods, a fine equal to 120£. of English money. It appeared that the man had misconducted himself with one of Bokko\'s wives. The trial created quite a sensation in Duke Town, all the Europeans being invited to attend by the King, who explained, through his interpreter, his determination to abolish the cruel practices so long the fashion there.

Since the abolition of the export of slaves, these localities have been the sites of trading stations, palm oil being the chief article of export.

We have given this in as full form as our space will allow in another column, and we only refer to it here to point out its general bearings and the effect it is likely to have in the future. No one can read the account without seeing that the Conference has made an honest effort to deal in an effectual manner with the evil of slavery. The maritime measures to be adopted offered some difficulty, on account of the refusal of France to concede the right of search, but she displayed the greatest readiness to secure the end in view by other measures. A scheme was drawn up by the French plenipotentiaries and became the basis of the deliberations of the Maritime Committee. The measures to be adopted on land were more easily settled, though here the interference with slavery as a domestic institution involved some risk of wounding Turkish susceptibilities. But the purely domestic is the least objectionable form of slavery; the slave-trade is the thing to be attacked by civilised nations, who trust to the spread of Western ideas and the gradual substitution of contract to put an end to domestic slavery. The arrangements made by the Conference will greatly hasten this process; and meantime the slave-trade will be severely and effectually repressed. The whole of Africa will be brought under repressive regulations, which may be more firmly enforced in some districts than in others, but will nowhere be entirely neglected. Following the lines laid down by the Conference of Berlin, the Conference has taken a broad view of its mission. Regulation of the trade in strong drink and in firearms does not directly bear upon slavery, but it does intimately concern the protection and preservation of African races. In order to diminish the evils of indulgence in strong drink, the Conference has decided to forbid its importation into regions where it is at present unknown, and to discourage its use where a trade already exists, by imposing a duty. As the Congo Free State covers an enormous area, any attempt to check the import of strong drink while leaving open that channel for its distribution would be simply useless. But by its constitution the Congo Free State guarantees perfect freedom of trade throughout its territories. We are sorry to see that Holland takes its stand upon this clause in the international agreement by which the Congo State is regulated, and refuses to countenance any relaxation. Because it is feared that this refusal of the Dutch Government to co-operate with the other Powers may lead to the complete waste of the efforts made for the suppression of the slave-trade as well as of the liquor traffic. Meanwhile, it must be admitted on all hands that the Conference has done a great and important work in preparing the way for the peaceful development of the native races.

All these trading establishments are constructed mainly of corrugated iron, with iron framework, though the interior may be lined with timber. The houses are well built, well ventilated, and comfortably furnished, and have all the appearance of a bright, pleasant home.

The conduct of the masters and seamen of these trading vessels was often outrageous. The way in which those earlier traders treated the natives was simply regulated by the power of the natives to avenge ill-treatment. With the missionaries it can be imagined how these ruffians came in conflict; and so angry were they at the prospect of the missionaries protecting their victims, or interfering with them, that they bribed and frightened the native chiefs, and used every effort to prevent the missionaries obtaining any hold on the country. The increase of steam navigation, and consequent supplanting of these sailing-vessel voyages; the more permanent settlement of European merchants on shore, where they began to build houses; the establishment and growing influence of various forms of administrative Government; and, it may also be said, the spread of civilisation, refinement, and sobriety among the seafaring class generally, brought about a better state of affairs in the trading colonies of West Africa.

In the first place, as S.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them.

This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Though, as both A. E. Afigbo and G. N. Uzoigwe have shown (Chapters 2 and 19), the boundaries of the states that emerged were not as arbitrary as is generally believed, there is no doubt that many of the states that emerged were artificial creations, and this artificiality has created a number of problems that are bound to bedevil the future development of the continent. The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. The examples can be multiplied. One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon. Secondly, because of the arbitrary nature of these boundaries, each African nation-state is made up of a medley of peoples with different cultures, traditions of origin and language.

Pre-existing African states, except for Liberia and, up to 1935, Ethiopia, lost most of their sovereignty and with it the right to participate in the affairs of the world community except indirectly through their new masters. Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

For by then both the political and religious leadership of the traditional societies had been conquered, colon› ized and humiliated. The traditional kings had been supplanted by an alien Secretary for Native Affairs such as Theophilus Shepstone in Natal, or the so-called 'Native Commissioners' and 'Native Departments' elsewhere.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

The result was that in some aspects of the life of a colony such as the purely secular the two systems could work hand in hand, while in some others they would work independently and, sometimes, at cross purposes.\nOne other social impact of foreign rule which was noticeable quite early in the colonial period was the general depression of the status of Africans. Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another negative impact of colonialism in the political field was the mentality that it created among Africans that government and all public property belonged not to the people but rather to the white colonial rulers and could and should therefore be taken advantage of at the least oppor› tunity.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Thus, for example, when this country lost its American colonies, our people found compensation in colonising Australia, and when the French were defeated by the Germans in the war of 1870, and were deprived of their provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, they appear to have concentrated their energies in an endeavour to extend the boundaries of their colonial empire. On the other hand, as soon as Portugal had taken its present form and shape, as soon as it became a country and a nation, Portuguese enterprise began to overflow into Africa. The great Spanish empire in America was founded on the heels of the consolidation of Spain by the union of Arragon and Castile. For the Germans the result of the war of 1870 was to consolidate the German nation, and when it ended they wanted new openings. These they found outside Europe—in the Pacific and in Africa.

In the absence of rivals, the course has been comparatively clear; and it seems difficult for Governments to realise that all this has been changed during the last two decades.

This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

The final showdown came in 1895, when the Nembe attacked the major depot of the Royal Niger Company at the port of Akassa and destroyed it. This was in protest against the Company's attempt to establish monopoly trade all the way up from Akassa in the delta to Lokoja at the Niger-Benue confluence.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

Certainly one of the exacerbating factors in the rising of the Egba in 1918 in Southern Nigeria was the very recent loss of their semi-independent status at the outbreak of the war. In Egypt, the Wafd riots which took place immediately after the war were largely inspired by a desire to shake off the recently imposed British protectorate, which, in its short wartime life of four years, had proved itself excessively ob› noxious to nationalists and fallähtn alike. In Madagascar 500 Malagasy, mainly intellectuals, were arrested at the end of 1915 and accused of 'forming a well-organised secret society with the aim of expelling the French and restoring a Malagasy government'. 33 A major concern of the Allied powers during the war was that Turkey's entry on the German side might encourage dissidence among their Muslim subjects. While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern.

Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest. Although none of them achieved this on any lasting basis, in each case the high point of their power coincided with their maximum north-south extension, even though the nucleus of the Bambara empire of Segu kept more closely to its west-east axis of the- valley of the Niger. However, during the nineteenth century, political instability and popu- lation movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu.

Though directed against the Levantines (who were accused of creating scarcity by hoarding essential commodities, and of elbowing out local middlemen), these riots were in fact a violent and uncoordinated protest against what were believed to be injustices arising from the manage› ment of the colonial economy. The looting and the riots spread from Free› town to Moyamba, Kangahun (25-26 July 1919), Mano, Boia, Makump, Bo, Bonthe, Mange and Port Lokko.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': 'The outcome of the Scramble and partition for Liberia and Ethiopia', 'content': ""No less hopeless was the internal situation. As indicated above, and for reasons already given above, the Liberian government was perennially nearbankrupt and owed huge debts to local and foreign creditors. By January 1908 Liberia's indebtedness to Britain comprised, according to the British Consul-General at Monrovia, £60000 a year 'for several years' while her indebtedness to German merchants in Liberia amounted to $120000 by September 1905. This indebtedness enabled the imperial powers to constantly interfere in the internal affairs of Liberia during the period under review in a way that they never did in Ethiopia where they were never provided with the cause nor the excuse so to do. Throughout the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the imperial powers sent mission upon mission to Liberia to offer aid to her to pay her debts if she would come under their protection. France did this in 1879, Germany in 1887 and Spain in 1886, and each power offered to regulate Liberia's finances, organize her defence, and establish and control her Frontier Force. At the same time, their resident ambassadors and representatives treated the Liberians with contempt and frequently imposed on her by denouncing her trade, customs and citizenship laws or bullying her to redress their nationals' grievances as Britain did in September 1869, August 1870, April 1871, February and June 1882, November 1886 and finally January 1909. 89 Germany similarly brought in her gunboats to intimidate Liberia in February and October 1881, in August 1897, January and September 1898 and December 1912. On each occasion, the German government demanded financial indemnity ranging between $3000 and $60000 from the Liberian government on mostly trivial grounds, particularly alleged 'insults' by Liberian officials to the German consul or German merchants in Liberia who invited the German intervention.\nThe three years 1907-9 witnessed an unprecedented escalation of this interference by Britain, France and Germany culminating in the famous 'Cadell Incident' of n and 12 February 1909.

In dispensing justice, he was accessible to noble and commoner alike. It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were. Thus began the careers of a number of great merchants with establishments in the coastal centres. At a lower level, swarms of petty dealers who played the role of door-to-door salesmen to the suppliers gravitated around the great merchants, on whom they were dependent.$^{62}$ The Asante merchants who, for their part, controlled the supply of products from the interior of Africa, namely the akonkofo, also constituted a factor to be reckoned with. 63 In much the same way, in the field of education new categories, or even entire social classes, came into being along the coast. At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone. These people were regarded as 'English gentlemen', and behaved accordingly. They were accepted in European circles and rose to positions of responsibility as magistrates, commanders of forts and the like.

The answer which he had returned to the communication of the Governor was that he should confine himself to pacific measures in the prosecution of his mission. In reply to the last part of the question, he was not prepared to say that there was any change in the policy pursued by the Government. He conceived that our object was to promote legitimate commerce, and to discourage human sacrifices by all legitimate means, and he should be always ready to use his best efforts to promote those objects, with the smallest possible expenditure of blood and treasure on the part of this country. It must be satisfactory to the House to know that the slave-trade was now almost unknown in Lagos; and he wished to add that he must not be regarded as concurring in the assumption that it was the policy of the Governor which was the principal cause of the difficulties in that quarter. The chief cause, on the contrary, he believed to be the war between the Abeokutas and the Ibadans, which the Governor was endeavouring by pacific measures to put down. He could not, he might add, countenance the imputation conveyed in the question that the French merchants at Porto Novo had been concerned in the slave-trade.

There are certainly in Lagos, as in every other place, persons who, either for their own purposes or for the sake of mischief, delight in bringing before the authorities irritating information which has no real foundation; if the rulers are not cautious to hear and sift thoroughly all they hear, they will often be led to do certain acts which, though little in themselves, will only be the sparks to bring a heavy and great explosion.

Sir Gilbert Carter appears, however, to be unaware that the second treaty with Ilorin, of the 9th of August 1890, was publicly negotiated in the town of Ilorin by Mr. Watts, a white gentleman who holds the post of executive officer for those regions, and who was received by the reigning Emir and his chiefs with the greatest cordiality.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Sir Gilbert Carter is referring to the country of Ilorin, and not only to the town, I must point out that it has been repeatedly travelled over by the officials of the company, including, amongst others, Captain Lugard, that officials of the company are now moving about Ilorin, and that a fort occupied by a considerable force and commanded by an officer in her Majesty\'s Service was established in Ilorin territory in the early part of this year.'}]","[{'document_title': 'LETTERS TO THE EDITOR', 'section_title': '', 'content': '(The Editor cannot hold himself responsible for the opinions of his correspondents.)*\n\n---\n\n### DISSATISFACTION AMONG THE NATIVES IN LAGOS.\n\n**TO THE EDITOR OF THE ""AFRICAN TIMES.""**\n\nDecember 18, 1884.\n\nSir,—Your journal being the representative organ in Europe for the West Coast of Africa, we feel compelled to state, for the information of the authorities in Downing-street and the public generally, that up to the embarkation in August last of Commander Rumsey, the Deputy Governor of Lagos, for Europe, the town was quiet; but since then there has been general dissatisfaction, owing to several ""acts"" of the present Administration, whose advisers have managed to create dissensions, and to set class against class. Acting under cover of authority, respectable natives have been arrested on pain of being locked up in the guard-room of the Houssas, or seized and deported to St. Helena, without any real cause, while the accused is kept ignorant of his offence. Such, Sir, are the acts of certain officials (European and native) in Lagos, who design to gain popularity, honour, and promotion by misrepresentations. The administrations of Sir Samuel Rowe, Lieut.-Governor Griffith, Captain Moloney, and Captain Rumsey are disparaged by these men. We ask, can a servant be greater than his master? These men say they know Lagos and Africa more than any other person. But what knowledge can be looked for from men whose previous lives have been all unfitted for such duties as they now have to perform? It is honourable to rise from humble positions; yet the mind should be humble; and when uncultivated, to give such persons positions is dangerous. Is it customary for the Premier of England, or the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send a policeman from their official residence in Downing-street to arrest any of the members of the Opposition simply on the report that they speak against the Government, and on their arrival in Downing-street to abuse and insult them, and ultimately send them to prison forthwith, or exile to Canada, saying that the official powers are extraordinary and unlimited? We ask, is this possible? and would such action show a cultivated mind and civility? It is an open secret in Lagos that such treatment is by no means uncommon here.\n\nIt is a blessing that we are under a Governor-in-Chief who is well able to check the ambitious views of his subordinates.\n\nIs it usual for the Premier of England or Governor of a colony to send a superintendent of police with one or two constables to proclaim, without law or ordinance, that no provisions are to be sold to a neighbouring friendly country; and if such country retaliate by stopping its own supply, then for the sovereign of the friendly country to be accused as a barbarous and atrocious king?—Your obedient servants,\n\n**LAGOSIANS.**', 'last_edit_date': '1885-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1885#article-28', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRUE STATEMENTS OF THE CAUSE OF LAGOS DISASTERS.—No. II.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—After perusing the several articles in the English papers (especially the _Manchester Courier_) on the affairs of Lagos, I feel that it is only fair and just to Governor Pope Hennessy that I should relate in your valuable columns a brief history of the cause of differences between the Lagos Government and the Egbas and Ijebus which have caused them to close their trade against Lagos up to this time; and being an African and knowing my countrymen, I think you will agree with me that my statements claim more credence than any which Mr. Charles Leigh Clare (who only wrote from hearsay, and has never been in Lagos) has or can make.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

Since that time there has been a restlessness on the part of the Executive, which has been unmitigatedly evil in its tendency. He is stated to have allowed a petition to be got up by certain dependents of the Government, calling upon him to annex Porto Novo and its territories. By sundry unnecessary and threatening voyages in the colonial steamer, attended by a force of Houssas, &c., he has given colour to the belief that he has such plans in contemplation; and considering what took place in the years 1864-1867, it is not surprising that merchants and traders, the whole of whose property would be imperilled and destroyed by a renewal of the overt and secret acts of policy then committed, should even give credit to the report of their Administrator having allowed his feelings of hostility against the Egba nations so far to prevail with him over all just, honourable, humane, and politic considerations, as to induce him privately to instigate the Kings of Dahomey and Ibadan conjointly to attack, and if possible destroy Abeokuta during the present dry season.\n\nThe proper policy of Lagos, as a great emporium of trade for extensive inland countries, must manifestly be to cultivate amicable relations with all of them, and scrupulously to abstain from everything that could give rise to suspicions of hostile feelings or intentions as regards any of them.

We cannot defer the preparations for our paper until the day of its publication, and are therefore under the necessity of commenting on what is known to us at the time we write. We hope, and have reason to believe, that before our present number goes to press, we shall have received the long desired intelligence of the difficulties with Egbas, Jebus, and others being all removed; and of the long desolate markets of Lagos overflowing with produce. We have not any such news at present; but what we have, affords additional proof of the heavy responsibility that rests upon all concerned in the Government of a trading British settlement or colony, when they, through ignorance or malice, pursue a course which is calculated to bring on a commercial paralysis. By inexcusable ignorance on the part of a Secretary of State, and the very wantonness of official evil on the part of an Administrator, the trade and commerce of Lagos was arrested in its course on the 18th of March last. The authorities of the native interior countries from which Lagos draws its commercial supplies, had been goaded by repeated and incessant insults and wrongs, into a condition of mind which led them to refuse all further trading intercourse, until the official author of those insults and wrongs should be removed from the office which gave him power thus to outrage them and their people. At the first glance it would have seemed as if trade would be immediately resumed, from the moment such removal were made, and the obnoxious measures repealed and abolished; and we must confess that, although our knowledge of African thought and action is derived from the varied experience of many years, we fell into the error of believing that such would be the case in this instance. We thought the Egba authorities and the King of Jebu, knowing as they did that the grievances of which they had so much reason to complain were the unhealthy spawn of one diseased official mind alone—that the quarrel really was between them and the late Administrator of Lagos only, and not really between them and Great Britain, would have hastened to show their satisfaction at the removal of their official enemy from his post and power, and have at once set free the fettered hands of commerce. It has not been so. Captain Glover was sent away from Lagos by Mr. Pope Hennessey, on the 15th June—and all obnoxious decrees, irritating and injurious to the Egbas and others, were at the same time repealed; but yet, up to the 6th August at least, the Egbas and Jebus had not removed their interdict on trade. The venom was still rankling in the veins of those who had been stung, and a sense of offended dignity prevented the due consideration of the evils resulting to their own subjects and territories, as well as to Lagos and its traders, from the prohibition to export that produce on which the wealth and progress of both the one and the other depend. Lagos and its native traders and merchants especially have been thus doomed to a prolonged continuance of those evils to which we briefly alluded in our last; and in the paralysis of all available means for paying debts and obligations, the law—British law—has handed the unfortunate fish to the greedy cormorants who are ever ready to seek their unjust gains among the necessities of their fellow-men. British officials spear the fish—British magistrates net them—and British cormorants devour them. We feel it to be our duty, therefore, to repeat the protest we made in our last, against the uninterrupted action of commercial law, through British legal authorities and tribunals, at periods when the British governing power has chosen for its own ends, or in its own ignorance or wickedness, to cut off from the trading masses of the community, those means by which alone they could be enabled to meet their commercial engagements. During the perturbation caused by the late French and German war—during the siege of Paris, and the reign of the Commune, and for some time after, no creditor was allowed to put the machinery of law at work in France, for the enforcement of civil contracts, to despoil and ruin his fellow-citizen. And thus it ought to have been in Lagos during this suspension of trade, which resulted entirely from acts of Government, and not from any acts or errors of individual traders, or from any cause which any one individual of the trading community, or the whole body of them combined, could suspend or control. They did what they could by remonstrance, by petition, by communication to the Home authorities, and through the African Times; and having done this, they are none of them morally, however they may be made legally, responsible for the results against which they petitioned and remonstrated. We do not need any spirit to come from the other world to tell us that these remarks of ours will not produce the effects they ought to produce. The duty of a public writer is not limited by the extent of his power to procure the justice to which he may establish a claim. It is his duty to hold aloft the lamp of truth, and leave the results of his so doing to others. It is at least a consolation to victims, if the light thus diffused, shall enable every observer to see that the wheels which are crushing the poor victims of commercial misgovernment, are official ones; that they have not voluntarily thrown themselves under them with suicidal intent, but have been thrust under them by an erring Secretary of State, and the malicious wantonness of official power in his delegate, to whom the victim was bound to yield unresistingly. The light thus diffused may, and often does, serve also to prevent the recurrence of errors and wickedness of a similar kind, and thus gradually helps on changes which conduce to an enlarged general security against the errors and aberration of constituted authorities.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1872#article-12', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

Another month, with the year 1873 also close upon us, without any news of the actual re-opening of trade at Lagos. Month after month brings us a repetition of the same hopes and beliefs—a repetition of the same disappointments. Where is all this to end? When are the reasonable hopes of the merchant and trader, based on an estimate of human wants and desires, to be fulfilled? Alas! we know not. Had the British policy at Lagos been a reasonable one, the native people around would have been encouraged, long ere this, to appoint someone to represent them in England—to make known their complaints and desires, and to seek satisfaction for them—instead of resorting to the barbarous system of cutting off communications, and annihilating trade, to the loss and inconvenience of their own people, as well as those of the Government with which they disagree. But, unfortunately, the British Executive in Lagos has been accustomed to represent itself to the native countries around as so immediately deriving its power from the Queen of Great Britain, and so essentially reflecting the feelings and views of the Queen respecting them, that any attempt on their part to appeal against its decisions and acts would be altogether vain and fruitless. Hence it has come to pass that, instead of referring to the British Government in England against the injurious acts and hostile policy, and aggrandising encroachments, of the local British authority, they have, to the great injury of themselves as well as of the traders of Lagos, met the injurious acts of the Lagos Executive with reprisals, and closed their roads and markets against us. What is to be done under these circumstances? The British Government either desire territorial aggrandisement for the Colony of Lagos, or they do not. They either wish that Lagos should be a territorially expanding colony, with all the necessary commitments as regards Imperial expenditure, or they do not. If they do not, nothing can be more easy than to give such assurances, and make such changes, as shall convince the Egbas and Jebus that there is not only no desire on the part of the British Government that Lagos should usurp power and dominion over them, and wrest from them their territory, but that they are entirely opposed thereto, and look upon Lagos solely as a commercial colony, the only conquests of which are to be those of trade and commerce—a promotion of the material development of their countries, and the spread of civiliza...', 'last_edit_date': '1872-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.741, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'ABEOKUTA AND LAGOS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The letter we have now published (p. 36) on ""What Caused the Heathen Uprising in Abeokuta on Sunday, October 13, 1867,"" brings the whole question of the unsettled and most unsatisfactory state of relations between Lagos and Abeokuta again prominently before us. The sale and gift of lands at Ebute Meta by the Lagos Government, constituting as this does an absolute claim and assumption of British authority over that portion of the main land, is a measure of such extreme importance as bearing upon the present and future relations between the British colony of Lagos and the native government of Abeokuta, that nothing short of the most imperious necessity, and the most indisputable and indefeasible claim, can possibly justify such proceedings. There is no portion of the West Coast at which the development of productive resources and the increase of commerce, may be so rapid as in the Abeokuta Territories (with Yoruba generally) and Lagos, provided there be a constantly good and friendly understanding and amicable relations between Lagos and Abeokuta. But for this it is essential that nothing should be done on the part of the Island Government to wound the just susceptibilities, or aggravate the unfortunate distrust of the Abeokutans, as regards British encroachment. The progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Yoruba countries and primarily among the Aku people, and the increase of the trade of Lagos, are desired results necessarily bound up together and inseparably united. It is not for the permanent mercantile interests of Lagos that she should be mixed up with the wars and disputes of the interior, except as a great civilised pacificator—as the representative of British Christian civilisation acting for the amelioration of adjacent heathen lands. But if Lagos holds absolute possession on the main land, she can scarcely fail to be involved in such native wars and disputes; and it must be expected that questions will continually arise to disturb the friendly intercourse of Lagos with the interior. We regard this matter of the present and future relations of Lagos with the main-land people, and especially with Abeokuta, as one of such very great importance, that we feel it to be our duty to solicit for it the prompt and especial attention of the Governor-in-Chief. Among the gross neglects of duty of Governor Blackall we look upon his conduct as regards this important matter, as one of the most serious, and at the same time, most irritating to native susceptibilities and suspicions. We see with pleasure that the Governor of Lagos has been lately invited to Sierra Leone by the Governor-in-Chief; doubtless for those explanations as regards the Lagos Government which could scarcely be fully given without a personal interview; and as the facts, real or supposed, as viewed by the local Lagos Executive, and the views of that Executive, will now have been brought under the keen and impartial mental scrutiny of Sir Arthur Kennedy, we look forward with hope and confidence to some action of the Governor-in-Chief, that shall lead to a speedy placing of the relations of Lagos with Abeokuta, and *vice versa*, on a just and friendly footing, such as will tend to the permanent reciprocal advantage of the inhabitants of the British colony and of the adjacent native territories.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'LAGOS AND THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'There can be no prosperity and increase of legitimate trade without peace.

Since it became a possession of the British Crown, Lagos has undergone great commercial vicissitudes, and much trading disaster has occurred through the unsettled or hostile relations of the colony with the Egba countries. We had hoped that this was entirely of the past—that the Lagos Executive had so far gained its point with the mainland people, that it could devote itself entirely to the fostering of trade and commerce and the employment of the increasing revenues consequent on a state of peace, to local improvements such as it befits a civilized Government to make in Africa, and to the education of the people so as to fit them for those free institutions to which they are destined. It is therefore with very great anxiety that we hear of rumours at Lagos of a meddling policy that threatens to renew the commercial disasters of the colony. We try to hope that the rumours are unfounded, and that the Administrator will not in any way justify the fears entertained of him.

If the description came to us from one quarter only, we should have taken no public notice of it; but it comes to us from several and distinct ones; and what we gather is, that his tone is not at all a soothing one; his bearing is lofty, for Africa, and frightens even Europeans away from Government-house. We cannot help feeling that this is a bad beginning. His predecessor, Mr. Berkeley, the present Governor-in-Chief of the West Coast Settlements, gained golden opinions of all in Lagos; he was beloved there; and we never heard that the public service was thereby injured, or the Queen\'s government thereby lowered in the estimation of Europeans or natives. It would be, indeed, lamentable should Colonel Strachan undo what Mr. Berkeley effected; nor do we hesitate to say that such a result would put an end at once and for ever to the system of appointing naval and military men as Administrators of commercial settlements—a system which was, with so much reason, denounced by the deputation, to whose interview with Earl Kimberley we have before alluded.', 'last_edit_date': '1873-11-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_11_1873#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.743, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

It was governed by its native king, who was placed on the throne, after the expulsion of the usurper, by the efforts of the British squadron, and was maintained in that position by the same power, and lastly it had the assistance, as British Consuls, of men of ability and local experience, who exerted themselves in every way to promote its prosperity and advancement.

Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers.

To the disappointment of the British, the Cape government agreed to annex Lesotho but turned down the offer of Griqualand West. The offer was refused because the Cape had a large Boer population that sympathized with the republics, which never gave up their claims to the diamond fields.

Just like the first Anglo-Boer War, the Lesotho armed conflict was intimately related to the British efforts to achieve a South African confederation. Both the Cape colonial government and the British officials at the Cape wanted to disarm the African states as a first step to federation. And it was the Sotho rejection of unilateral disarmament that led to the Cape-Sotho War of 1880-1.\nSince 1872 Lesotho had come under the Cape colonial administration.

With a large force of infantry and cavalry, he met Moshoeshoe at Platberg on 15 December 1852 and delivered an ultimatum that was impossible to fulfil. Moshoeshoe was ordered to produce within three days 1000 horses and 10 000 cattle, which would be used as com› pensation for the Boer property lost during the Warden war and also to finance Cathcart's own current expensive expedition. When Moshoeshoe failed to meet the deadline and pleaded for more time, Cathcart ignored the King's excuses and ordered an invasion of what is today Lesotho.

The tensions reached such a pitch that Boshof was forced into a tactical resignation in February 1858 and, when he withdrew his resignation, several members of the volksraad left in protest. Coupled with the internal disputes were the increasing border quarrels with Lesotho. Boshof decided to check the border disputes by invading Lesotho in March 1858.

By it you will perceive how private feelings and vengeance were allowed to reign in the place of strict justice; how a respectable family was ruined to satisfy the personal animosity of Captain A. H. Hall and A. B. M'Intyre, in spite of all the legal measures that were taken to protect the property of an unoffending old lady who, at the time of the outrage of Captain A. H. Hall, and his friend, A. B. M'Intyre, was lying on a bed of sickness.

One of the soldiers was severely beaten, and very deservedly so. The troops had been for a long time in the habit of systematically ill-treating the people, beating them, plundering their goods in the market-place, and other irregularities.

A scuffle ensued, and stones began to fly about. It has never been ascertained which side threw the first stone. No great mischief was done. But shortly after the throwing of stones, the greater part of the garrison came out, under command of Major Irey, and began to kill and wound everyone they could find. Some soldiers broke open the little hut of a respectable young man named John Sanaiz, stabbed him in bed, dragged him out through the window, pulled him along the ground for thirty-six yards, then killed him with blows of the butt-ends of their guns and stabs of bayonets. One man was quietly eating his supper when some soldiers came up and stabbed him to death, and threw his body into the sea. I believe six people were killed, and I think fifty-eight wounded. I was the foreman of the jury on the inquest held on the body of John Sanaiz. Mr. M. Doorly, paymaster of the 4th West India Regiment, was coroner, and he made strong efforts to induce us not to bring in a verdict of murder.

The soldiers of the garrison have suddenly issued forth at night, with some of their officers, and have treated this town as if they had taken it by assault in time of war. Houses have been broken open, their inmates dragged forth and slain, or wounded, or beaten, or taken to prison; property has been seized; neither sex, nor age, nor rank, nor condition has been spared; for among the victims are found male and female, old and young, rich and poor, sick and healthy. Men, asleep in their beds by the side of their wives, have been dragged forth through the window and put to death, with cruelties that make humanity shudder. An inquest has been held on the body of an unhappy man who was treated thus, and the jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the party of soldiers who committed the deed.

Hamilton arrested the two men, and proceeded to the sea coast. At Apollonia he embarked in a boat with his prisoners, but no sooner was he off the beach than five canoes, with armed Apollonians, pursued him; but on account of their perceiving that he was armed, they gave up the chase, returned on shore, and made prisoners of Lieut. Hamilton\'s hammock-men and carriers, fourteen in number, whom they now hold as hostages.\n\nNow, just fancy such an act as this being perpetrated in the time even of Governor Andrews, Ross, Pine, or Jones.

It is kept as a sort of secret at Government House and the Fort, and well it might be!\n\nWhat I have all along said has come to pass. The British Government exercises no more influence over the kings and chiefs of the Gold Coast Protectorate than the writer of this letter; and, as far as my long acquaintance goes with these people, I cannot come to any other conclusion than that it would be to the credit and advantage of the Home Government either to send out gentlemen, and men of education and experience, to govern this so-called protectorate, or allow the natives to do it themselves. We are plunging deeper and deeper in difficulties every day. Colonel Conran by proclamation says British rule does not exceed fifteen miles in the interior. Mr. Usher sends up an expedition a few weeks after some eighty or ninety miles in the bush to settle some petty dispute between two chiefs, whilst human sacrifice is permitted to have full swing at Akropong, eighteen miles from the British fort at Accra.

In our last we showed that one of these asserted his being possessed of power and influence over the head of the Government there to the extent of being able to influence and control all appointments. We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice? ""Cæsar\'s wife should be not only pure, but above suspicion."" The abuses at the Gold Coast have reached a height that must, we think, induce some vigorous action on the part of the Colonial-office. But we despair of any effective measures until the anomalous position of the Gold Coast, as regards its connexion with the British Government, be totally changed. The British Government is in a false position there, and some decision as regards a change must soon be arrived at. Our views on this subject are well known. We are bound as a nation to the Gold Coast by ties that we cannot, dare not sever; and it becomes incumbent on us to assume such a position as may be made at the same time creditable to Great Britain and largely advantageous to Africa.

He was ordered by Mr. O'Callaghan, the magistrate before whom he was brought up, to be flogged, and the punishment was inflicted publicly outside the gates of the castle. In the evening the men assembled and marched out of the castle with their band, and went to a place called Napoleon, five miles distant from here, and situated in the bush. The Government here (so called out of courtesy), consisting of three or four gentlemen, were exceedingly alarmed. Some chiefs and native gentlemen of Cape Coast succeeded at last in bringing back the mutineers, 170 in number, and most of them have been sent up to Sierra Leone in a man-of-war. The castle is now garrisoned by some sailors and marines from vessels of war and the Cape Coast Volunteers, a native force, who, although greatly despised and ridiculed some time ago by some officers of the Gold Coast Corps, have rendered efficient service since the late mutiny.

As a native of this Gold Coast, I take much interest in whatever appears in the African Times having reference to my country. Few in England know or care much about these settlements, where reside, nevertheless, several hundred thousand human beings, black indeed in colour, and for the most part half clothed, but very many of whom are perfectly capable of appreciating the comforts of life, and the benefit of a strong and efficient Government.  \nA Committee of the House of Commons is investigating the state of affairs here.

It may be that from time to time I shall take the liberty of addressing you, if my communications should be of any interest to your readers, or of service to my country and the cause of truth.  \nMr. Richard Pine, the Governor of Her Majesty's Forts and Settlements on the Gold Coast, is about to return to England, and will, doubtless, be examined before the Committee of the House. His Excellency returns to his own country covered with troubles as with a garment. He is at feud with our powerful and warlike neighbour, the King of Ashantee; he is on bad terms with the chiefs and people of what are called the Eastern Districts of these settlements—districts containing a thriving and industrious population of two or three hundred thousand persons; and there is an open rupture between his Excellency and the King of Cape Coast. So much for the natives. As regards the Europeans, it is known that his Excellency and the military authorities have, for a long time, not been on such terms as that they could co-operate cordially for the benefit of the Queen's service. In short, Governor Pine's hand is against every man, and every man's hand is against him.  \nThe public care not to hear of trifles, significant though they be to us here, who know how to construe their meaning; suffice it to say that the removal of Mr. Pine from this scene of his labours is regarded by the people without regret. His government has been fruitful of misfortunes for us. An unhappy war, needlessly provoked on his Excellency's part, rashly begun, badly conducted, complicated with occasional communications to the enemy in Bombastes Furioso style, ending ingloriously, nay ridiculously, as far as concerns British prestige on this Coast, fertile of destruction to the doomed and unhappy brave, whom a mistaken policy sent forth to perish uselessly, not by the bullet of the foe, but by the pestilential breath of the deadly demon who sits enthroned amidst the foul swamps and marshes which effectually protect the Ashantee frontiers from invasion; a system of arbitrary exactions and unprecedented interference with the details of every department of the public service, the military, the judicial, the ecclesiastical, causing much sore feeling, and an amount of confusion exceeding belief; the adoption of a practice of personally hearing causes between man and man (contrary to law) in the Government House, and with the assistance of a native interpreter whose practices and proceedings have not increased the public respect for the Government—these are the chief features that mark the administration of his Excellency Governor Pine.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

Colonel Conran, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast, and in this capacity resident at Cape Coast Castle, has up to the present time justified the hopes we had formed, the expectations we entertained of him. Only a few days after his arrival he called together the native authorities of the town, which is situate under the guns of Cape Coast Castle, and laid before them his plans and suggestions for the removal of nuisances and abuses which preceding Governors had tolerated, but which, unremoved and unremedied, were effectual barriers to all progress in the material evidences of civilisation. And without the material evidences of civilisation, no real progress of civilisation is possible. We refer our readers to Governor Conran's address to the King and chiefs, and other native authorities. We like to get our justification from time to time by official documents. This of Governor Conran's is an important one for us. It gives such a catalogue of official British neglect that we can point to it with confidence and say, have we exaggerated the evil state of affairs at Cape Coast? have we unjustly charged British authorities and officials with attending only to their own private interests, and, but too often, most immoral pursuits, and neglecting all that could really promote the well-being of a people who require to be taught even the very first steps in the great onward march of progressive civilisation? The streets impassable, because so encumbered with putrifying animal filth and decomposed vegetable matter!—every house a graveyard!—no proper supply of water!—no observance of the Christian Sabbath! We refrain from giving the whole catalogue. It is a damning one to successive batches of past officials, and to some present ones; and we thank Colonel and Governor Conran from our hearts for his so speedy and vigorous effort for the real material good of the population at large, and for the health of Europeans and others whose duties entail upon them the necessity of residence in Cape Coast Town or Castle. And we thank him the more heartily because we feel deeply for him in the trying position in which he has been placed by events so unexpected when he was addressing the native authorities. The conflict which has taken place between the West India soldiers of the garrison and the natives was a most unhappy commentary on the very humane and proper caution given by the Governor to the native authorities with regard to those culpable excesses which too generally attend the noisy, riotous heathen festivals. The Governor threatened the extremest penalties of the law— the British law—should lives be lost in any party fight among the natives; and lo, instead of such party fights the soldiers of the garrison ran riot in the town, killed two or three people, and gravely wounded some sixty others. The good discipline of the troops under Colonel Conran had during the past twelve months been the constant theme of letters from Cape Coast. But it seems as if during the Colonel's absence in England to give evidence before the Parliamentary Committee discipline had been relaxed, and the result is of course that which always occurs in such cases—deplorable excesses, which must necessarily entail punishment on the offenders, and subject the whole corps to restrictions, painful for the commander to order, and for the men to endure. We do not think it necessary to make any further remarks at present on this painful subject, as we have the fullest confidence that Colonel Conran, Lieut.-Governor and Commander-in-Chief on the Gold Coast, will do all that is necessary for the enforcement of proper discipline, and that justice to the injured and to the relatives of the slain can properly demand.

By this means the intelligence was received at Madeira, and was telegraphed to England six days earlier than would have been the case had the Corisco been left to pursue her voyage under ordinary conditions.\n\nThe Corisco also brings news that, acting upon the information received from Cape Coast Castle, the Governor of Sierra Leone at once dispatched by the mail steamer Cameroon, also belonging to the British and African Company, a body of 250 men of the 2nd West India Regiment, which rendered excellent service during the late Ashanti war.\n\nThe forces at Cape Coast Castle consist mainly of Houssas, these being natives of superior education and discipline, who ordinarily fulfil the duties of military police, and whose valour in the field during the last war was repeatedly displayed. The Cameroon left on the 29th January, and proceeding direct, would reach Cape Coast in about four days' time, so that the threatened colony would be relieved on the 2nd inst., before which time it is hardly likely that any actual outbreak can have occurred."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-02-07', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-19', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

The volume of returnees increased round about the mid18308 after peace and stability had been established by such rulers as Moshoeshoe, founder of the Sotho nation.$^{21}$ The first five years of the Mfecane seem to have seen more refugees entering the Colony. George Thompson is reported to have said that there were 1000 Sotho and Tswana refugees in the Colony by 1826.$^{22}$ This was about three years after the influx into the Colony started.\nWhatever numbers were involved, several points are indisputable. First, as already pointed out, the scourge of the peoples of Natal, the Caledon and the Orange valleys and the Highveld areas was, ironically, the blessing of the Cape Colony, bringing as it did cheap labour into an agricultural community that was on the point of collapse for lack of labour. The timely arrival of this source of labour gave a fresh impulse to the agricultural industry of the Colony's Eastern Districts. Secondly, the influx of refugees was bound to generate socio-economic patterns that were to alter the character of the Colony. For instance, it is said that in Albany and GraaffReinet the 'all-white phase' of the settlements, during which white farmers, their wives and children had been compelled to do the most menial tasks, was ended by the arrival of African labourers. This change, we are told, had been completed by the late 1820s.$^{23}$ The change undermined one of the fundamental principles underlying the founding of 'Anglostan' or Albany, that of white settler self-reliance.

To start with, many of the new farmers were not qualified to do the work for which they had been brought to Africa. There was also a general complaint that the holdings were too small. Then came floods in 1822 that destroyed all the crops. Many farmers had abandoned their land by 1823 and those that still held on had lost their original enthusiasm and were broken in spirit. With the small amounts of capital they had brought from Britain rapidly dwindling, many were either heavily in debt to the government for rations or were facing destitution. Excessive drinking was on the increase as many a broken heart sought to drown its worries and sorrows. 10 With just about a third of the original number of the farmers still on their plots in 1823 and facing formidable odds, the whole future of the Albany settlement as an agricultural venture was highly doubtful.

Jobs disappeared, wages dropped and working conditions deteriorated, as mining interests sought to minimize costs.

Three days ago a young man received a wound from some of them who were attempting to carry away a box of tools from his premises; and three young women, shameful to relate, have been driven this morning by the said refugees, who were in ambush between the town of Bathurst and the Oyster Creek.

He says that the pagans of those districts were incorrigible. Work they would not; but, as they must still live somehow, they lived by robbery, plunder, and murder. The French, he says, never allow such practices to be carried on within the limits of their colonies. Some of the Babboos, and others of similar character, who fled to Goree for protection, have already been driven across the mainland by the French Governor; and others, who had sought refuge in the French fort of Cowlack, have been surrendered (their lives being guaranteed) to ""Mahaba,"" who is now compelling them to labour and live, or neglect labour and starve.""

On receipt of news last March that he had attacked these towns, I proceeded there with your son, Mr. Horace H. Hutton, to try to prevent our stores being robbed, but he (Beram) had left with his banditti, having previously looted Jarcotta. Our agent informed us that Beram had come over suddenly with a force of robbers numbering about 2,000, including 500 horsemen, and had taken the town. The people and farmers fled in a body, leaving their crops and all they possessed. I should mention that as the Government did nothing to stop the former raids of Beram, I went to remonstrate with him last January at Cowar; but, notwithstanding this, our agent only escaped with his life and by surrendering about £150 of goods; but we shall never receive a penny of the heavy credits he had, as customary, given out to the farmers, as all had been ruthlessly plundered and their crops destroyed. Beram also looted and utterly destroyed Barracounda, another flourishing town near Jarcotta. Afterwards he commenced another raid in union with Marmood Derry Bah and the King of Saloum, who are chiefs ruling tribes in the lower river. The former actually receives, under treaty, annual subsidies from Her Majesty’s Government to keep the peace and protect our traders. They attacked the Prince of Badiboo, burned his towns, and laid waste the whole of one of the best-cultivated and most flourishing districts; the people fled, and dare not return.\n\nThese cases only illustrate a few out of the many outrages which have taken place in the Gambia annually for several years. It must be borne in mind that, besides our paying duties to our own Government, these chiefs levy on our traders and planters heavy taxes, and yet British merchants have to submit to be thus plundered.\n\nThe town of Bathurst is now full of refugees pleading with the Government for help from these robbers. The Administrator, Captain Moloney, does all he can, but he has only a few native police at his disposal, and his powers have been completely withdrawn by the London Colonial Office; however willing to help us, he is under orders to use no force, and he dare not act without authority from England. Even our men-of-war have orders to give no assistance up the river. Although in a British river we are thus openly outraged almost under the eyes of the officials, our laws will not permit us to defend our property and rights; otherwise we could organize a force to put down these robbers. Their influence and power might have been easily suppressed a short time back, but now they are increasing throughout the river, and it will now require a strong force, and unless some steps are taken, they may endeavour to plunder Bathurst and drive the Government into the sea.'}]","[{'document_title': 'RIVER GAMBIA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'From month to month, during several months past, we have been receiving complaints from the Gambia, and especially from Bathurst, of abuses and mismanagement affecting the welfare and safety of the greater portion of the community there. We have refrained from publishing them until they should be confirmed, which they have now been; and still we shall confine ourselves to a mere general allusion to the principal subjects of complaint. A very serious one as regards the general population seems to be, the inefficiency of the police force, and the monopoly of the little service they are capable of rendering by a certain limited district of the town, to the entire abandonment of the other portions. The police being paid out of the colonial revenue, even were higher considerations set aside, it is a matter of mere pecuniary justice that the services they render should be general, not partial. All our correspondents agree that the force is not only inadequate and badly selected, but that what policemen there are, are scarcely ever to be found beyond the precincts of Wellington-street, where the principal European merchants are established. That the property of the merchants demands full protection, there can be no doubt; but it is most unjust that those portions of the town inhabited by the coloured population should therefore be left a prey to the lawless and violent, who are to be found in all communities. It is not only unjust, but it is a most short-sighted policy—if such practices can be dignified by the name of policy—because if violence and plunder be carried on with impunity throughout the greater portion of the town, the result will infallibly be the establishing of a criminal population that will in a short time be too strong for the police in the favoured street. From plundering the houses of the poorer classes, which it seems they now do with absolute impunity, they will in time descend in force upon the stores and dwellings of the wealthy. And if as a nation we have any one thing more than another to inculcate among the coloured inhabitants of our colonies, it is the advantages that are secured to a people by law and order among them—by that security for person and goods which ought to be found, as a rule, in towns and districts under civilised authority.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-07-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.609, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Policy of Non-Intervention in Western Africa: Its Mischievous Tendency on the Good Government of the Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The political horizon of British Gambia is by no means in a satisfactory state; clouds are gathering from a quarter which ordinary men regard as a menace to the peace of the river.

He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony. What was the *casus belli*?\n\nThe ostensible cause of this warlike and menacing attitude was, that a woman with a few children* availed themselves of Mahba's temporary absence from his capital, and made their escape to the British town of Bathurst. He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda.

This indifference and neglect, which we feel justified in designating criminal, not only interferes with the progress of civilization, but subjects the community, both European and native, to renewed outbreaks of those destroying pestilences which have from time to time decimated the town of Bathurst. Year after year the educated native inhabitants, as well as Europeans, have protested against the continued permission by the authorities to the natives from the river villages who flock to Bathurst for trade, to perambulate the town in a state of nudity, and perform all the operations of nature when and where they choose, without the slightest regard to decency, and in defiance of all sanitary regulations which ought to be enforced in any town under British rule and law. We are at a loss to understand why such things should be—why British officials should continue to tolerate them, as if a decree had gone forth that it was not desirable that the blessings of civilization should extend in Africa. Bathurst, and all other towns on the Coast under British government, ought to be brought fully under civilized regulations, and become spots from which civilization should radiate into the neighbouring territories. That they should not be this, is a gross neglect of duty on the part of the authorities, and reflects deep disgrace on Great Britain. It is absurd to suppose that there could be any real difficulty in insisting upon public decency within the town of Bathurst. While the unclothed natives from the river villages are allowed to come into the town in their unclothed condition, and treat the town in every way as if it were the bush or fields in which they reside, they will no doubt continue to do so, and look with ignorant and barbarous contempt upon the inhabitants who are not permitted, and would no longer permit themselves, the offensive freedom from all self-restraint which they, the ""untutored savages,"" enjoy. Is it too much to expect that British authority will now at last interfere on the side of decency and health? The ""untutored savage"" would not forego the substantial benefits he or she derives from his or her visits to Bathurst because compelled to wear a proper cloth and conform to certain sanitary regulations; and, accustomed to these self-restraints within the town of Bathurst, they will thus have entered, however superficially, into the arena of civilization, and become more accessible to the propaganda of civilization among themselves. Important, however, as this change for which we call would really prove to be, it is but secondary when viewed in connection with that continued neglect of the drains, and that continuous horrible condition of the place of sepulture, respecting which the Memorialists protest. Everyone who has watched and recorded the ravages of epidemics on the West Coast of Africa must remember but too well the awful visitations to which Bathurst has been subject. Only last year it was threatened with one of them, and not a few persons perished from its advancing breath, when, happily, a sudden meteorological change drove back the fearful enemy. In some of our letters we find fears expressed that the present season may be rather an unhealthy one on the West Coast, and the mere suspicion that it will be so ought to induce precaution on the part of individuals and authorities. The latter are to a certain extent answerable for the lives of the population over whom they rule; they are fully answerable to the extent of removable causes; and among removable causes, that of pestilential drains, of filthy thoroughfares, and of graveyards in which the decaying dead are exposed to public view, filling the atmosphere with poisonous gases, must certainly be included. By the time this number of our journal reaches Bathurst the fiend of pestilence may—though we fervently pray it will not—may, we say, be upon the town.

The troops have been withdrawn, and not only the troops, but also all the arms and ammunition and field-guns, so that, literally, if the people were attacked at that moment they have neither weapons nor ammunition to defend themselves with.\n\nThe small garrison was withdrawn as far back as May last; still no steps have been taken up to the present moment by the Governor-in-chief to organise a force for the protection of the town, except the addition of ten unarmed men to the police force.\n\nNo British gun-boat or vessel of any sort has been sent to the Gambia since the withdrawal of the garrison, and surrounded as the inhabitants are by savage tribes who look with longing eyes on the property of the British and foreign merchants stored there, I should not be surprised to receive news some day that the settlement of Bathurst was burned and destroyed, after having been pillaged."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1871#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.616, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Recent Riot in the Gambia Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Nov. 17, as the result of a conflict between the police and the inhabitants, the town of Bathurst was for the whole day in the hands of a mob, chiefly composed of Mohammedans, who drove the police into their quarters, and for some time besieged Government House. The cause of the rising is said to have been the shooting of a Mohammedan while the latter was at prayer. The police are recruited at Sierra Leone, and are not Mohammedans: for a long time bickerings have been very frequent between the Natives and the police, and the killing of the Mohammedan caused a rising of the whole Native population. These armed, some with firearms, others with sticks and stones, attacked the police. The latter fired on the mob, and on both sides many persons were injured. The police made for their barracks, which are in the centre of the town, and on reaching the building barricaded the doors. The mob tried to force these but without success, and towards evening the crowd turned their attentions to Government House, where Mr. Llewelyn, the Governor, was with about six white officials. The mob, in a threatening manner, demanded the expulsion of the police from the town. The Governor advised the Natives to be quiet, but a number of them made for the flag-staff in the garden where the British flag was flying and attempted to pull it down. The officials, however, with whips and canes, defended the post, and kept the flag flying. The officers purposely avoided shedding any blood, and were able eventually to get the crowd outside the gates without sacrificing a single life. Mr. Llewelyn read the Riot Act, and promised the mob that the police should be removed. The crowd then retired from Government House. A tornado, accompanied by a deluge of rain, happened very opportunely to break over the place, and expedited considerably the restoration of order. The authorities then went to the barracks, and the police were taken in batches of about a dozen each to the river, and were placed on board the Government steam yacht Mansie-Keelah. The police were under the command of Lieuts. Cowie and Hicks, and the former, in endeavouring to get his men into barracks, received a wound in the head from a stone.

The rains have been so plentiful that the crops promise to be heavy and good, and famine is already disappearing. The season up to the present has been unusually healthy; part of this may be attributed to the improved state of the drains and streets, under supervision of the acting Colonial Engineer. N.B.—This is generally the case when the office is in the hands of an acting man. When the permanent man is here, economy, dirt, and disease go hand in hand.\n\nThieves have been as plentiful as the rains. Some time ago they broke open the Customs' stores and took three baskets of colar nuts out, had shipped two baskets in a canoe, and were in the act of shipping the third one when they heard the night patrol passing, got frightened, and fled with their canoe, leaving the third basket on the beach. Now, there was one constable as sentry at this store, and another at the Customs' gate across the street, yet neither of these men heard or saw the thieves. Query: Are they and the police in collusion? The fact is, the Government ought to bring in a sort of vagrant law to check the congregation of loafers and bad characters in Bathurst. Such people, having committed crimes in other parts of the river, flock in here, and any day you will see scores, aye, even hundreds, of native men lounging about under trees, sleeping or conversing. These men never work, have no known business; most of them are known to the inhabitants here as bad characters; they remain here for weeks or months until they can make a haul, when they disappear, and are absent as long as the plunder lasts.\n\nThe French in Senegal have a good way of dealing with these fellows.

Half of such loss is caused by sheer embezzlement, the other half is divided between reckless trading and gross laziness, wherein a trader sits down at his port and wastes his time, neglects his trade, and merely cares to live an idle existence, eating up a large portion of the goods in his charge, spending on himself and friends. I had a Jollof man one time who in one month spent 100l., feasting and giving presents to, and enjoying himself with, the warriors at Bombally. I brought him down here, brought him before the police court, but he got off on a technical point. The only heavy loss I had from the natives was when a band of marauders from Binto attacked and set fire to some houses and stores I had, in 1879, at Ballingho, in Baddiboo. The place was in charge of three or four of my people; the marauders fired on them and drove them away, then looted and destroyed the place. Had I been there myself they would never have touched it. But a loss like this must be expected where civil war is raging. I have been trying to catch the leaders of this party; when I do the native law shall take its course.

I could not see Goomba as he had gone up country. However, I had the means of repaying him: up to the present that gun has cost him 15l. It is quite true that the increase of customs duties and ""presents"" at various ports is beyond all reason, and the trade suffers from it; but then all such expenses are credited to the account of the traders, so they do not suffer.

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Despite subsequent attempts at reform and punitive expeditions, Governor Pine was forced to abandon the tax in 1864.\nThis was the first resistance movement of a purely social and national, that is to say non-ethnic, character. It was very quickly followed, moreover, by an action$^{6}$ of much greater scope since it was political in nature. As early as 1864, the chiefs on the Gold Coast sent a register of grievances to Governor Pine to protest against encroachments on their rights and inter› ests, giving specific examples, such as imprisonment by mere civil servants, to show how their dignity had been flouted.$^{7}$ Shortly afterwards, Aggrey, the 'king' of Cape Coast, went even further.

It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes.

All these measures which gave the traditional rulers powers to collect revenue and to impose court fines as were unknown before, were, according to Stone, 'an attempt to make the chiefs a living part of the machinery of (colonial) government'. Economically, the era saw the alternation of periods of boom with those of recession and inflation - the latter in 1915-17, 1929-30 and the second half of the 1930s. It also saw the spread of the cocoa industry into the rural areas especially of Akuapem and Akyem Abuakwa which led to the emergence of an increasing number of rich young farmers and long-distance traders. Socially, the period also saw the spread of elementary education into the rural areas and while some of the products of these schools drifted into the urban centres, others stayed behind and took to either farming or petty trading. With all these changes in their socio› economic status, these rural people began to demand a corresponding change in their political status and especially representation on the state and provincial councils, a demand which the ordinances mentioned above made steadily impossible.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up.

In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The Asante system: its rise and decline', 'content': ""Maclean's career3 blossomed after the new retreat of the British govern¬ ment, which, caught up between its embarrassing allies on the coast and the fighting spirit of Asante, felt that the Gold Coast was too expensive in terms of money and human lives despite the British victory at Dodowa. Maclean, President of the Council of Merchants that provided the local administration of the forts, could therefore give free reign to his business acumen and knowledge of people, often disregarding official instructions from London, where a committee of merchants once again had charge of the forts. He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open. Maclean tried gradually to acquaint the Fante with English legal principles through a hierarchy of courts ranging from the chiefs' courts to those over which he himself presided. Local militias posted at the chiefs' courts helped to apply the new laws, whilst the introduction of cowries for minor transactions and the encouragement of the production of palm oil started to change the economic structure.\nHowever, the British government decided to resume direct control of the coastal settlements in 1843 and to govern them by a legal convention among the chiefs recognizing British law (the Bond of 1844).$^{4}$ In 1858 the administration of the Gold Coast, which, apart from the forts, was a protectorate rather than a colony, was separated from Sierra Leone.

It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

It is highly likely that this social policy was a factor in the great rebellion of the princes that broke out in his reign at the instigation of the most important of his ministers, the Widi Naaba.\nLastly, we may mention the coastal lands, where the driving forces of trade and education were producing a qualitatively new type of social stratification. Once the basis of commercial activity had shifted from the slave trade to the exchange of palm oil, rubber, ivory and gold for European products, a new merchant class emerged, operating with stocks of trade goods advanced by European companies, whose agents they actually were.

At the top of the hierarchy stood the descendants of the great merchant families, such as the Bannermans of the Gold Coast who, since the early years of the century, had been educated in Europe or at Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Sierra Leone.

These refusals to co-operate did not seem dangerous to the colonizers, who believed that peace had finally been established in Madagascar in 1905. But then, suddenly, in 1915, the revolt of the Sadiavahe the nickname given to the insurgents - broke out in the south-west, while in Antananarivo the police discovered the existence of a secret society known as Vy Vato Sakelika or VVS - 'strong and hard like stone and iron' (see Fig. 10.3)."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Madagascar, 1880S-1930S: African initiatives and reaction to colonial conquest and domination', 'section_title': 'A country offering uncoordinated resistance to colonial conquest', 'content': ""The breakdown of society within the 'Kingdom of Madagascar', the collapse of the old order, the domination of the oligarchy, the economic crisis and the imperialist threat were all factors that gave rise to a profound moral and spiritual malaise among the mass of the people, who began to hark back to an idealized vision of the past and to advocate a return to traditional ways.

A little beyond Prahsoo, about three and a-half miles, lying E.N.E. half E., is the town of Atawascoo, and about half-a-mile from that place there is a cataract right across the river, formed by a layer of rocks, through which, during the dry season, an enemy can easily walk. During the late Ashantee invasion the greater part of the division under Essa Ma Quantah crossed over at Atawascoo and at this cataract, as is evident from the number of dilapidated tents to be found under cover of the high trees. This cataract, of course, during the rainy weather is a very dangerous path, and no one would attempt to cross by it. Again, there are fordable paths lower down the river, at some distance from Prahsoo, which no force at that place could protect. If the King of Ashantee intends to attack the camp, it is not to be supposed that he will be so idiotic as to send a small force of one or two thousand men, but he will send from twenty to thirty thousand. If 6,000 cross over at Atawascoo, and before the force at Prahsoo knows what it is about push on to Assempah Naya, on the road to the seacoast, thus entirely cutting off our retreat; another 4,000 cross over the third bend of the river below the camp, thus presenting themselves on the flank of the Prahsoo; and a small body of men appear before the fortified stockaded front of Prahsoo to draw our attention—what on earth could a small force of 200 men at Prahsoo do, 100 of whom are sick in hospital and fifty just out of hospital, and as weak as could be imagined? A sharp commander would at once get his sick into the stockade, with the whole of the people in the camp, excepting those on guard; but one night surprise by the Ashantees would prove a finale, as there would be a general shooting in the stockade.

The new system of a Governor-General at Sierra Leone, and subordinate Administrators at the other settlements, was inaugurated with the mendacious announcement of an improved executive everywhere, increased regard for the civil rights of the natives, and augmenting efforts to prepare them for the work of self-government. These were good and specious generalities; pity it is that they were lying ones. We cannot afford to be choice in our use of terms in commenting upon the exploded delusion. The Parliamentary Committee of 1865 commenced under the auspices of the Colonial-office, a very pretty prismatic-hued bubble, which the Office continued for a time to inflate, but has now left to burst, leaving us with only a filthy residuum of dishonest trickery and open violence. We were fully aware that the appointed Governor-General distrusted the Africans, disliked them, and held them in unmitigated contempt. But reflecting on the wide field of action now opened to him, and having before us instances of men seemingly small in mind expanding into great opportunities, we looked at him through the solar microscope of our ardent hopes and desires. But however immense the bulk seemingly imparted, an insect does not become an elephant under this process. Remove the magnifying medium, and the insect is an insect still. Our disenchantment has long been complete. From the moment the Governor-General returned to the Coast with his new honours, he appeared in his natural size. We were soon made aware that to be a friend and supporter of the African Times was a disqualification for office, whether paid or honorary, even for a European. This did not look well. The Governor-General knew, none better, that the one only object of the African Times is to obtain pure, honest, enlightened, efficient government on the West Coast; such as may conduce to the rapid advance of Christian civilisation, and the development of material resources. We defy the Governor-General, and all the Governors or Administrators, and other officials on the West Coast, to point out any one instance in which we have unjustly condemned the acts or conduct of officials. Of course our denunciation of his effort to shut up the stream of justice from the poorer natives of Sierra Leone, by compelling them to give securities for costs before they could bring an action for damages, however grievous and infamous the wrong they might have sustained at the hands of some unscrupulous European, official or other, was a great crime on our part. But we waited; we made no allusion to, much less remark upon, the information which reached us by every mail of the systematic hostility with which we were regarded by the chief authority on the Coast; we waited, although we saw evident traces of the influence of that well-known hostility at the Gambia and at Cape Coast; we waited until evidence was piled on evidence in proof that if Downing-street really desires the preparation of the Africans for self-government, their Governor-General at Sierra Leone is about one of the worst men they could have chosen for the important charge committed to him. We do not deal with small matters, or we should have dwelt upon his arbitrary removal of the Murray Town bell, an act well calculated to stir an excitable people to violence that might have produced bloodshed and a long train of lamentable results. But his conspiracy with unworthy subordinates to filch away the cherished liberties of the citizens, by an ordinance for depriving them of the right of jury in civil cases, crowns his official misdeeds. It is such an insult to a whole people as certainly disqualifies him for further rule over them. If we turn our eyes to Cape Coast all we now see there causes us pain and sorrow. It grieves us to say that Colonel Conran has proved himself for some time past a worthy subordinate of his chief at Sierra Leone. For what he did well in purifying Cape Coast Town, &c., we gave him unqualified praise. But beyond such matters he has shown himself mischievously incapable. He has treated all the civil offices at Cape Coast as if they were included within the precincts of the barrack-room; he has dishonoured the Bench and brought the administration of justice into contempt by making judges and magistrates of ignorant and prejudiced officers; he has so persistently outraged the feelings of the natives, crowning all by the late violent arrest and deportation of their king, Thomas Aggery, the first Christian King of Cape Coast, that our only surprise is that hitherto, so far as our information extends, there has been no violent popular commotion, although he seems to have wantonly stirred up a universal antagonism with himself. A man who allows his private prejudices to influence his public acts is quite unfit to be entrusted with power. The present aspect of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast generally is afflicting in the extreme. Mr. Richard Pine did incalculable mischief there, and Colonel Conran has made matters infinitely worse. Experience, as in the case of King Aggery, and of the two disbarred advocates, has proved that an appeal to Sierra Leone, while Governor Blackall remains there, is a farce and a delusion. The two advocates alluded to certainly used language improper to be used by gentlemen in Court, but under circumstances the provocation of which Chief Justice Hackett was compelled to admit and to condemn; yet Captain Hall, the bosom friend of Dr. Oakes, of Bathurst notoriety, whose condemnable conduct as a magistrate provoked the offence, receives only a few words of censure, while the two advocates are persecuted to the full extent of official arbitrary power; and Governor Blackall himself, a patron of barrack-room magistrates and judges, grants no redress.

Through the opposition of your Government, those who stood security for the money given to the delegates to the Parliamentary Committee are not yet paid, and the men are suffering. Very likely they will lose their houses and all they have in the world for it, because whenever a meeting was convened for the purpose the Government called it seditious, and letters have been sent to all districts not to render Cape Coast any assistance to defray the expenses incurred by sending delegates to England. Oh pity! these chiefs King Aggery sent men to for the money were committed before the delegates were sent to Parliament, and it was to redeem their promise that King Aggery sent messengers to them. Colonel Conran changed the meaning, and called it ""King Aggery taxing the people."" We expect to give more information by our next, if the town of Cape Coast by that time is not bombarded. However, King Aggery is true blood of the late King Joe Aggery—his own son. Quashie Attah\'s parent was servant to this present King Aggery\'s grandfather—he is no Royal blood at whatever.

Mr. Hughes was much beloved by the whole community, and his loss is one of the greatest that has befallen the Gold Coast for many years past. His influence with the natives and their confidence in him was such that no matter of importance was ever adopted without his being first consulted. He was a patriot in the fullest acceptation of the word. Thousands, we are told, gathered round his grave on the 12th July, and their evidently real sorrow testified that he was a good man! Mr. Hughes was a great supporter of Her Majesty\'s Government at Cape Coast. During the Ashantee War he took active action in support of Mr. Richard Pine\'s government, and when the time came Mr. Hughes, although notoriously very much reduced in circumstances, politely refused to receive any remuneration for his great services. Subsequently Colonel Conran, with his coarse barrack-room notions, availed himself of every opportunity to insult and annoy Mr. Hughes, so that for some time he and others were forced to seek safety at Elmina. At a later period it was through his great influence that several Ashantee captives were given up by the Chief of Assin to be returned to the King of Ashantee, by which another war with Ashantee was prevented. Mr. Hughes\'s kindness of disposition was very remarkable. He had great knowledge of native medicines; and many lives were saved by him, particularly of those afflicted with dysentery, for which he discovered a specific, which was noticed in the African Times some time ago.\n\nWe are also grieved to record the sudden death of Nimbe Irving, Esq., at Accra, Gold Coast, at 8.30 p.m. on the 30th July, 1869. At 4.30, while complaining of a slight headache, he was seized with a fit, which was followed by five others, in rapid succession. An eye-witness, an attached friend, writes, ""It was really fearful to see such a fine, apparently healthy, strong man cut down in four hours."" He had suffered greatly from anxiety through the mercantile difficulties arising out of the state of the Eastern districts.

""Vide et Crede"" has, as if by a providential inadvertency, touched on one of the many wounds which have festered and suppurated and have at last settled down into an angry visible sore. I allude to the conflicting, contradictory, senseless action of the Government at Cape Coast at all seasons and under all circumstances. ""Vide et Crede"" states, for example, that Colonel Conran declared the fact, by means of a proclamation, that ""British rule did not exceed 15 miles in the interior."" Colonel Conran, having spoken in this authoritative language, takes his leave of the seat of Government under an inauspicious ovation. As soon as his back is turned, Mr. Usher, who sits in his place, sends a Lieut. Hamilton ""80 or 90 miles into the bush"" to settle some ""petty squabble."" Surely, both of these Administrators cannot be accused of uniformity in their ideas of government. So, again, I remember the day when Mr. Andrews strove, in the heated amiability of his heart and soul, to bring the long line of the Kings of Cape Coast to an end, in order that he might consolidate the functions of the British law within the circuit of the town at least; and I remember the day also when Mr. Pine, moving in an eccentric orbit, fired a salute of twenty-one guns in glorification of the crowning of the very Aggery whose kingship Colonel Conran has flouted with so much martial scorn and has bespattered with so much official mire. Either Mr. Andrews and Colonel Conran were right, or Mr. Pine was right. If Mr. Pine was correct in his royal views and exultation, Aggery is king, and irresponsible in his kingdom to the white man; and if Mr. Andrews and Colonel Conran are no less exact in their estimation of the utility of abolishing the monarchical forms of Cape Coast, Aggery is rightly an exile, because responsible to the local Government for the expression of an offensive, independent opinion, and for the pursuit of an offensive, independent act.\n\nThe chiefs themselves have often complained to me of the difficulty under which they laboured in mastering the wishes of the Government; for, as they have justly remarked, one Governor will say one thing to-day, and another Governor will say another thing precisely the reverse to-morrow.

The soldiers of the garrison have suddenly issued forth at night, with some of their officers, and have treated this town as if they had taken it by assault in time of war. Houses have been broken open, their inmates dragged forth and slain, or wounded, or beaten, or taken to prison; property has been seized; neither sex, nor age, nor rank, nor condition has been spared; for among the victims are found male and female, old and young, rich and poor, sick and healthy. Men, asleep in their beds by the side of their wives, have been dragged forth through the window and put to death, with cruelties that make humanity shudder. An inquest has been held on the body of an unhappy man who was treated thus, and the jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the party of soldiers who committed the deed. God knows that it is no exaggeration to state that on this fearful night the soldiers went about the town indiscriminately killing, and wounding, and beating unarmed and unresisting men and helpless women. The list of casualties on the side of the people of the town, as ascertained up to the present, includes 2 men killed, and 58 men and 5 women wounded, bringing up the ascertained number to 65 persons killed and wounded, besides very many who were more or less severely beaten. On the other hand, I am informed that two soldiers were much beaten. It is notorious, and is, I presume, not disputed in any quarter, that, as some of the townspeople were holding their annual native festival in the Anabfoo quarter, some soldiers rudely interrupted the festivities, and that a scuffle ensued. I appeal to the records of all the courts of the Gold Coast as to whether the natives are now, or ever have been, in the habit of either injuring, or insulting, or annoying the military. Unhappily, those records tell us too often and too plainly that the soldiers have long been to us a constant source of great anxiety, and uneasiness, and alarm, by their incessant and uncalled-for attacks upon unoffending persons in market-places, on the highways, in the public streets, in private houses, by day and by night.

Coker, Clerk of the Court (the British court of justice at Cape Coast), on the charges of extortion, embezzlement, forgery, receiving bribes, &c. It was our intention to have entered fully this month upon the question of King Aggery's arrest and deportation to Sierra Leone; but as we have taken measures for bringing the subject under the notice of the House of Commons, we think it right to defer those remarks which we should under other circumstances have made without fear or favour. The situation is altogether a very grave one. The charges brought against Colonel Conran by King Aggery in his petition and in his letter, which we now publish, are of a very serious nature, and such as we think can scarcely be shelved by the Colonial-office in its archives without some open and impartial inquiry into their truth or falsehood; and into all the attendant circumstances, provided their truth should be thus established. That there was an unprecedented state of relations between the British authority and the native King is beyond all question; and it remains to be seen how far the Colonial-office may be justly held responsible for evils that may have thus originated. When we saw, long, long ago, after the sharp parliamentary party contest relative to the disasters of the so-called Ashantee war, and the deliberations and report of the Committee of the House of Commons, that all the pre-existing bases of relations, real or implied, between the British Executive and the people of the protectorate were to be changed, we urged the necessity of an immediate official publication of the instructions given to the Governor-General and the Lieutenant-Governor or Administrator at Cape Coast. We said this was necessary, in order that all parties might know their relative positions. Secrecy, where the mutual relations between authority and the governed are abruptly changed, is always indefensible on the part of the former, and unjust and dangerous to the latter. Except where a stern, unreasoning tyranny is established (and we presume the British Colonial-office did not intend to institute such a system at Cape Coast), there are obligations on both sides, and the subjects have a clear and indisputable right to know what they may do and may not do, and what the governing power will do for them in return. This course has not been followed at Cape Coast: all that had been was unsettled—all that was to be was shrouded in mist and darkness—so shrouded that we have serious reasons for believing that the Queen's Administrator himself was ignorant of the attitude and position he was to assume and maintain toward the people who had been so rudely awakened from their dream of efficient protection in return for customs dues and submission to British orders and to British tribunals."", 'last_edit_date': '1867-02-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1867#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Copy of Petition of the King, Chiefs, Headmen, &c., on the Gold Coast, to the Governor-General', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Cape Coast, September, 1866.\n\n_To his Excellency Major Blackall, Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Colony of Sierra Leone and Forts and Settlements on the Gold Coast of Africa._\n\nThe humble Petition of the undersigned King, Chiefs, Headmen, and other Residents on the Gold Coast under the British Protection,  \nHumbly sheweth,\n\nThat your petitioners, having taken into consideration the present unsatisfactory state of affairs on the Gold Coast, and of Cape Coast in particular, arising from the present mal-administration on this Coast, have unanimously resolved to address your Excellency with the view of drawing your Excellency's attention to the same.\n\nThat your petitioners sincerely deplore the undignified ill-treatment to which his Excellency Colonel Conran has at various times subjected the King of Cape Coast.

I address you very seldom, and I know enough of the world, and of the manner in which men's minds are acted upon, to be aware that personalities and abuse in journals do not prove anything, nor convince those whose opinions are worth having. Therefore, whilst I feel it necessary to call upon you to tell Colonel Conran, through your columns, that this whole country is at present grievously discontented with the manner in which he permits justice to be administered from the bench, I abstain from mentioning the name of any individual in particular, whose conduct has been obnoxious to censure. I cannot, however, refrain from telling the Colonel, through you, that there is really a very serious amount of discontent (to use a mild term) in these settlements among all classes of the people, and this feeling is likely to be greatly increased by a step which his Excellency has lately taken. He has made prisoner Quakoo Ganin, the Ashantee refugee, who fled to Cape Coast Castle for protection in 1863, and he has decided on sending him to Sierra Leone. This has been done, as I positively know, by advice of the agent of a certain London firm, whose power on the Coast has hitherto been paramount. It cannot be said that this power and influence over the Colonial Government has, as a general rule, been exercised for evil. Nevertheless, the agents of this house do exercise notoriously a degree of authority in the councils of the Queen's representatives, which has given rise to much remark and many sarcasms."", 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-12', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abuses, Misgovernment, and Maladministration on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As regards Cape Coast, we must say that the whole system seems to be wrong and rotten in every part.

We do not believe this. We do not believe that Governor Pine is a man likely to allow himself to be made such a tool of. But we can imagine the case of a needy Governor and other public officials coming under pecuniary obligations to a leading member of a Legislative Council thus constituted, until all the power became virtually vested in him. And the possibility of such an abuse as this ought not to be allowed to exist. Then, again, we learn that the acting Civil Commandant for the important Eastern Districts—a young sub-agent of the same firm, and whose nomination to this office was obtained by one of the members of the Legislative Council—that this young man has taken for his chief counsellor and guide the Mr. James Bannerman who was last year sentenced to one year\'s imprisonment, &c., for gross abuses in the administration of justice, in complicity with Major de Ruvignes, the then Chief Civil Commandant, who surreptitiously left the Coast rather than meet the charges against him, and is now said to be shooting, for a wager, gorillas at the Gaboon. Is it any wonder that the Eastern Districts are disaffected? Is it any wonder that with a Legislative Council so constituted, there should be rumours that the Kroboe fine, the source of so many past evils, was to be the cause for fresh complications and disasters, fresh impolicy and injustice?

The Government House and the market are both situated outside the fort and within the precincts of the town.* From time to time a chief was elected, who, on being approved by the Governor, received the title of King, according to what may be a somewhat injudicious practice of white people in designating chiefs on the African Coast.

Before this could be effected, an immense quantity of bush and prickly pear had to be removed. It took some months of hard work to accomplish this. Once clean, the Colonel was determined to keep it so, and placed sentries at different points to prevent nuisances from being committed on the ground.\n\nAs Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Conran will, of course, have to be judged by his works.

The unsettled state of relations between the Fantee people and the Ashantees, aggravated by such acts on the part of some of the former as that recorded in our news from Cape Coast for the present month, is such as to justify very strong apprehensions of another invasion of the Fantee Countries by the King of Ashantee. With the uncertainty that at present attaches to the relations between the British authorities and the natives, as regards the nature and extent of protection which the former are to afford to the latter in the event of another of those cruel invasions which inflict so much injury on the country, it is most important that some pacific relations with the King of Ashantee should be again established, if practicable. We have never held the late Governor, Mr. Pine, responsible for the difficulties in which the last Ashantee troubles originated. These were known to exist before Mr. Pine left England to assume the government at Cape Coast. But without entering upon the question here as to the course pursued by Mr. Pine in dealing with those difficulties, it is sufficient to say that, in the opinion of everyone conversant with the people of the Gold Coast, and with the actual state of relations between Cape Coast and Ashantee, his continuance in charge of the administration at Cape Coast would have greatly increased the difficulties of the position. The appointment of Colonel Conran is therefore important, as removing what may be called the personal obstacles to a good understanding with Ashantee; while the concentration of the whole powers, civil and military, in the hands of one individual insures a unity of action that may exercise a decided influence on all parties on both sides of the river Prah, which separates Fantee from Ashantee. We have been assured that if there be a really good understanding between the native authorities at Cape Coast and the British Governor, such acts of violence on the Ashantee frontier as we have before alluded to may be easily and effectually repressed. We know of no reason why this good understanding should not now be arrived at. Colonel Conran is not a new man at Cape Coast. He and the natives have had two years' acquaintance, and he is said to have gained golden opinions among them. In congratulating both the Lieutenant-Governor and the natives on his appointment, we feel justified therefore in something like a confidence of hope that many scandals, and much that has been disgraceful to Great Britain there, will be put an end to at Cape Coast. A great amount of prudence and self-denial is requisite in the Governor if he would retain the trust and confidence of the natives, and uphold the character of this Christian country in all his public and private relations with them.

In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details supporting the claim, emphasizing the abrupt withdrawal's direct consequences, such as the rise of local powers like Ashantee and Dahomey, and the ensuing violence and instability. The articles highlight the British government's failure to establish a permanent pacific arrangement with Ashantee, leading to fears of invasion, and describe the chaotic state of the region, with roads being unsafe and local tribes engaging in hostilities. The lack of military presence left settlements defenseless, as noted in a letter to Earl Kimberley, and allowed Ashantee to reorganize and threaten the Fantee countries.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed.

With a large force of infantry and cavalry, he met Moshoeshoe at Platberg on 15 December 1852 and delivered an ultimatum that was impossible to fulfil.

The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast. Above all, the Asantehene was deposed partly as a result of the outcome of the 1874"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'Political structures', 'content': ""Of the major states that survived from the eighteenth century, few could have done so without major internal reform.

Certainly one of the exacerbating factors in the rising of the Egba in 1918 in Southern Nigeria was the very recent loss of their semi-independent status at the outbreak of the war. In Egypt, the Wafd riots which took place immediately after the war were largely inspired by a desire to shake off the recently imposed British protectorate, which, in its short wartime life of four years, had proved itself excessively ob› noxious to nationalists and fallähtn alike. In Madagascar 500 Malagasy, mainly intellectuals, were arrested at the end of 1915 and accused of 'forming a well-organised secret society with the aim of expelling the French and restoring a Malagasy government'. 33 A major concern of the Allied powers during the war was that Turkey's entry on the German side might encourage dissidence among their Muslim subjects. While Turkey's call to djihäd evoked less response among the subject Muslim populations of Africa than the Allied colonial authorities feared, they were constantly on the alert in case of disaffection among their Muslim subjects and were at great pains to reassure Muslim chiefs and leaders that the Allies were not hostile to Islam. The imposition of martial law and the imprisonment of nationalists in Egypt was partly inspired by fear of a sympathetic response to the Turkish call for djihäd among the Egyptians.

In 1848 he took away vast Xhosa territories by annexing to the Cape Colony the area between the Fish and Keiskamma rivers and then declaring a separate British Colony of Kaffraria between the Keiskamma and Kei rivers. Many Xhosa were prevented from settling in their former lands west of the Keiskamma, which were now parcelled out to the Mfengu 'loyalists' and white farmers. In Kaffraria itself, the Xhosa were split, up and allotted 'reserves', while their chiefs' powers were severely circumscribed by the supervision of imposed white magistrates. Such customs as labola (bridewealth) and accusations of witch› craft were outlawed as being contrary to British justice. Moreover, the white magistrates knew very little of the Cape Laws and nothing of the Xhosa legal system, with the result that they followed their personal instincts in reviewing Xhosa cases submitted to them.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'British withdrawal from the interior', 'content': ""Smith sparked off the war by his rough handling of the chief and, indeed, disregard of the people's attachment to their institutional authorities. He summoned the paramount chief, Sandile, to a meeting in King William's Town. Sandile refused to go because a few years previously the British had treacherously arrested him after he had responded to a similar summons. Smith deposed him and tried to impose in his place a white chief and Sandile's mother, both of whom were rejected by the Xhosa. Smith then outlawed Sandile and tried to apprehend him by force. By December 1850 the Xhosa had had enough of the British Governor's interference in their lives and began to attack British forces and military installations in the area. They wiped out a number of military villages.\nSandile's cause received wide support from neighbouring Africans. East of the Kei river he got the moral support of his brethren under Sarili's paramountcy. Many members of the African police and Cape Coloured Mounted Riflemen deserted and joined Sandile's forces. The Khoikhoi and some of the Thembu also fought on Sandile's side. The result was that many white farmers and Africans who sided with the British were killed, their livestock captured and immovable property destroyed. Meanwhile Smith relied on local African allies because the Cape Colony white farmers were not willing to fight his war. Even with more reinforcements he received from the British government in March 1852, Smith failed to crush the Xhosa rising. The war was only brought to an end by his successor, Sir George Cathcart, who enlisted the support of the Cape white farmers by promising to give them a part of the cattle looted during the campaign.\nIndeed when the Xhosa were defeated in October 1852, both the Xhosa of Sandile and those of Sarili - who lived east of the Kei and had mostly accorded moral support to their fighting western brethren - lost vast herds of cattle to the British. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': ""In addition, the captives which these kingdoms needed as a form of currency with which to buy rare goods and the instruments of war were being carried off at a rate which was becoming less and less compatible with the survival of the societies concerned, especially when they were seized from peoples already subject to tribute, since that depleted the reserves of the dominant powers. Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, those countries whose economies had been kept going by the 'ports of the desert' at the end of the caravan routes were now enclosed and isolated, being separated from the coast by other states, at a time when basic trading patterns were collapsing. In such circumstances they were bound, slowly but inexorably, to fall into decline.\nIn these circumstances, as often happens in periods of crisis, social divisions were exacerbated, transforming the relatively egalitarian struc› tures that had been characteristic of the societies of the Sahel during their period of ascendancy. Another factor was the evolution of the religious movements which, after the tolerance towards traditional cults shown during the preceding centuries, had adopted a more intransigent attitude as a result of the djihad, which had triumphed in Liptako and had swept through the Bambara states.

Although the clandestine nature of the exodus precludes any accurate assessment they appear to have been rather large in scale. Official British records indicate that more than 50000 Africans living in the Zambezi valley fled into Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland between 1895 and 1907 in the misguided hope that British colonialism would be more benign.$^{42}$ The existence of a common or related ethnic group on either side of the frontier facilitated the withdrawal of the Ovambo and Bakongo from Angola and the Shona and Chewa from Mozambique (see Fig. 8.1). In Nyasaland large numbers of lakeside Tonga and Tumbuka migrated from the Rukuru watershed to outside the sphere of British control to avoid paying taxes; 43 Creation of refugee communities in desolate areas constituted a variant of the withdrawal strategy. Rather than crossing international boundaries, the peasants, many of whom had refused to satisfy their 'legal' responsi- bilities, created autonomous enclaves.

Many thanks, too, for the several bits of information from the continent of Europe, by which you even anticipated the fulfilment of my petition. Would to God we could write you, after our comparatively small disturbances, such good news as we hear from Europe after so dreadful a disturbance! There is to be seen the difference of the very worst disturbance, even a fratricidal war among *Christian* nations, and comparatively small ones among *heathenish* nations: *there* the brightest features of Christianity, philanthropy, and real civilization immediately after the sword is sheathed; *here* the worst features of fiendish heathenism, cruelty, robbery, &c., months after a miserable war is fought, and nobody who can or *will* help. The state of our country is getting worse from day to day. The inimical tribes are still as bold-faced and faithless as possible, and the country on this side is swarming with vagabonds who make use of the weakness or carelessness of the Government, English and native, and disturb the country. The roads are unsafe or stopped, people and goods panyared, the worst characters say it openly that they may do as they like, there is no Government, and if anybody applies to the Government, he receives the answer, ""We cannot interfere."" Every fellow who has the boldfacedness, sits down anywhere, and settles palavers, and robs the industrious people of thousands of heads of cowries, hardly earned, and nobody interferes. The other day the Governor sent a letter to the King of Aquamoo to ask an account for his misbehaviour. The King flatly denied all the charges against him, slaughtered a man on the very same day, his subjects refused passage through their country to one of the missionaries going to Anum, while at the same time lots of them came down to the Accras, Kroboes, and Addahs to Kpong, &c., to buy salt, &c., and were not in the least hindered. A man of the King who was panyared by an Addah man, was released by Odonko Azu, and safely sent back to his master just at the very time when the missionary was stopped there. Since then the only road to Krepee—by Bato—has also been stopped, and all the missionaries, merchants, traders, with the well-inclined people beyond the Volta, been cut off from us. The cotton trade is of course again spoiled, and the lives and properties of all those who were formerly under English protection, and even settled there under promise and encouragement of English protection, are in danger. How the English nation can bear such things is more than a person of common sense can understand; for all this is brought about by a few thousand people, who are entirely dependent on the Volta road, which is in the hands of the English Government, and can be shut with the utmost ease, or are situated at the sea-shore. Not a drop of blood wants to be shed, not a British soldier to be moved, to put a stop to this, and at the same time have Ashantee, which partly depends on the Volta road, in check. If a single man-of-war steamer demands peace from the Awoonlahs, and the Addahs, Kroboes, and Accras stop the roads to and from Aquamoo, and the very numerous Pekijies, Agoitimes, &c., join the former from the other side, the Awoonlahs will give in at once, will be cut off from the Aquamoos, and the latter must either sue for peace or leave their stronghold in the Volta rapids and go to Ashantee, with which they fraternise. But neither for peace nor for war is anything done in unison, and the country goes to ruin. Even among the so-called protected tribes in the very neighbourhood of the Government the most shameful and cruel acts are perpetrated, and nobody takes notice. Notwithstanding all the greatness and glory of the British Empire all over the world, the former security of a British citizen— which to become many of us fairly rejoiced when England took this possession from the Danes—has become a byword here out, and the thought cannot be repressed that if this large empire begins to show symptoms of dissolution at the extremities, there must be something wrong in the very heart of it; for even heathenish Rome, at a time when it was rotten enough, many years after Christ, was still able and willing to protect her honour and interest at the extremities of her vast empire at a time when communication and intercourse were twenty times more difficult than now. In 1850, when the Danish Gold Coast possessions were given over into the hands of England, the English and German missionary interest consisted of four stations, twelve missionaries, some few native agents and schools, and about fifty Christians; now they consist of more than 1,500 Christians on about 20 stations and out-stations, sixty to seventy missionaries, thirty native agents, two seminaries for such; ten educational institutions, with altogether about 300 to 400 pupils, a thousand day-scholars, many Sunday and evening scholars, several thousand persons able to read and write either English or one or two of the native languages, several large agricultural, industrial, and mercantile establishments, and a vast amount of property. In 1850 there was scarcely a beginning made in the reduction of the principal languages of this Coast into a written form; they were not used in our schools; now the three principal languages, Oyi (Fantee, Ashantee), Ewe (Krepee, Dahomey), and Accra, are not only reduced to a written form, but we have grammar, dictionaries, primers, prayer and hymn-books, and the Bible, either entirely or in part, in &c.; some of the books have seen several editions, are eagerly demanded and read, and have spread from Ashantee to Dahomey. The Danes had no trade of their own to protect; the only Danish vessel which came regularly every year was a Government vessel; still, they not only protected us at the coast and in the interior, but gave us also several hundred pounds every year for educational purposes, especially with respect to the mulattoes, for whom they rightly conceived to have a duty; and cared for good roads; and now? Even for roads and schools the English Government have no money; those of us who are beyond fifteen miles round the forts are without protection, and this from the most powerful Government of the world, a Government which *has* plenty of real interest to protect, to whom we have paid thousands of pounds of duty, and for whose prosperity we have done our utmost, even with danger of life and property! I cannot blame his Excellency the Governor; I really do not know who is to be blamed; but this I know, such a state of things is a dreadful blame to any Christian Government, and most to the English, to whom God has given such power, opportunity, and responsibility for doing good. About fifty missionaries are buried on this coast; more lie now here with their wives and children, above 20, 18, 15 years. We have not laboured, suffered, died in vain. The climate of this country is, by far, not the worst feature of it, but may be overcome, and is partly overcome by Christian influence. But shall it be said, that after three—four hundred years of European intercourse, protection, and influence, not always of a blessed kind! now, when so much has been accomplished, the English Government left us to ourselves? Is it not their duty—I will not say their interest, though I might—to protect what has been gained under their protection till the people can do it by themselves? or if not, at least to give us over to another *Christian* Protestant Power, and not leave us to the mercy of Ashantee and Dahomey and their imitators *en miniature*, the petty heathenish kings. I speak from a human point of view. I know full well the Lord, whose work we do here, does not want England, nor Europe, nor America, for the regeneration of Africa; but what if He has given her, England or Europe, this task and they refuse; will He not ask for an account? But England *cannot* for any length of time withdraw herself from Africa! Africa is, as it were, the last undigested lump of the globe on which all the energies of the Christian nations are and will by-and-bye concentrate to permeate and assimilate it; they will not suffer it by us as by a dead incubus.

The man-of-war retired, and two days after appeared in the roads again, and the commander sent off five armed boats, and with a message that he desired my presence, the compliance of which a second time was refused by the Awoonahs. Directly the five boats began firing and killing Awoonah people. These withdrew, and returned to their towns, and bade me release and set free the two brothers I caught, which was accordingly done. This man being released and set at liberty, went into the interior, and, to take revenge, killed some Awoonah traders, and plundered them of their effects.\n\nUpon this the Awoonahs sent one chief, Baddagho by name, to a place called Maffee, to have with the Addahs all palavers settled and peace made, as also to have all the money due me by Addah people demanded. The people of Maffee readily consented to have this done, but the Addahs refused peace and desired waging war against the Awoonahs. Therefore they attempted to kill the messengers. This was an insult offered to the Awoonahs, and the threatening to kill their messengers was tantamount to a declaration of war. So Baddagho went up to the vicinity of Croboe with about 300 men, seized about ten men and all the canoes belonging to Addah people.\n\nAddah, in conjunction with the Accras and Aquapims, commenced hostilities against the Awoonahs, fought with Baddagho, defeated him, and so he was obliged to return home. The three nations did not discontinue the war, but gave a new life to it, and therefore the Awoonahs sent Jackoto, their general, to meet with them in their (Awoonah's) own territory, and fight them. The Accras retired after this battle. The Governor of Cape Coast, with his colleague, the Governor of Lagos, came up to settle the palaver, but, instead of settling it, he assisted the conjoined nations against the Awoonahs, gave them also British soldiers to fight against the Awoonahs. This made the palaver worse.\n\nNow that the war was over, the Governor-General of Sierra Leone comes down here and desired making peace between the four fighting nations.

It is the influence she can exert by her religion, her philanthropy, her literature, her commerce, and, above all, her example. The example which England offers to other countries, of institutions in which the problem of combining liberty and order has, in some degree at least, been solved; the example of growing prosperity, of peaceable progress, of great activity in works of charity and mercy, and, we will add, the example she has lately given of minding her own business, without meddling in other men\'s affairs, and reaping the reward of her abstinence by saving her blood and treasure—all this cannot fail to tell powerfully upon surrounding nations, if we leave that influence to its natural operation, without attempting to force ourselves obtrusively and offensively upon them. But this is by no means what too many even of our leading statesmen mean by ""influence."" What they want is something loud, aggressive, dictatorial, menacing—the influence that is to be sustained by an officious and swaggering diplomacy, and by having a large army and navy in the background to threaten and command. ""English influence abroad"" was one of the conjuring phrases with which Lord Palmerston so long deluded his countrymen; and the ideas it embodied, if it can be said to embody any idea, formed the corner-stone of that meddling and mischievous policy by which, without in any appreciable degree affecting the current of European affairs, he made the name of England hated all over the world. No better way could be taken to bring into discredit this vile phrase than by tracing its effects when reduced to action by Lord Palmerston. We have not the time or space to do it now very fully. But we refer to a few illustrative facts. In 1840 he used the influence of England to form the Quadruple Treaty, the only effect of which was to deliver Syria over to a much worse ruler than we had to depose, and to bring us to the very verge of a war with France, from which we were only saved probably by the timely succession of Lord Aberdeen to office. In 1849 he used the influence of England to pick another quarrel with France on the question of the Spanish marriages, on which the events that immediately followed formed so bitter an ironical comment. In 1848 he used the influence of England to encourage an insurrection in Sicily, and then withdrew his protection, leaving the unfortunate Sicilians to the tender mercies of the King of Naples. In 1850 the pretext of upholding English influence led him to that quarrel with and attack upon the little kingdom of Greece, which excited the execration of all nations, brought upon him and upon us a humiliating lecture from Count Nesselrode, and a great increase of Russian influence in the East of Europe, led to that breach of faith with the French Government which issued in the recall of the French Ambassador from London, and to such exasperation of feeling throughout France as probably would have led to war, if their hands had not been full with the business of re-organising their own Government after the Revolution. And so we might go on with a succession of events in which the ""influence of England"" was put forth as an excuse for a policy of intervention, the principal effect of which was to irritate the Governments of Europe against us, and to betray the people who had trusted us.'}, {'id': 3586, 'article_title': 'Letter of Merchants and Traders to Governor Rowe', 'full_section_title': 'Letter of Merchants and Traders to Governor Rowe', 'last_edit_date': '03-15-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1878#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_05_1878', 'content': 'Sir,—Your Excellency having already been informed by the chiefs and traders of the Boom River that war has recently broken out there, it is needless for us to again enter into particulars concerning the same.

If we had done our duty as a great protecting Power, such a menace as that which has now come to entail expense upon the Imperial Exchequer, and to alarm the important industries now actively engaged in the development of the vast resources of the Fantee countries, which, under the name of a protectorate, are indissolubly a portion, and a most promising portion, of the British Colonial possessions, could not have been made to ""frighten the land from its propriety."" The last Ashanti War, in which Sir Garnet Wolseley, with his army, took possession of Coomassie, ought to have settled the question once and for ever. According to all traditions of Africa, Ashanti, as a conquered country, should have thenceforward received its laws from the British authorities at Cape Coast Castle, and should never again have been allowed to raise its head against us. Our readers will not have forgotten how strongly we protested against that unparalleled hasty withdrawal, so much like a retreat, of the conquering army from the Ashanti, territory without the imposition of conditions constituting Ashanti a vassal of Great Britain. Her Majesty\'s present Ministers were in power when the expedition to Coomassie was so admirably projected and organized, and so successfully carried forward under Sir Garnet Wolseley, aided by the co-operative action of the forces under Sir John Glover. It has never been made clear whether the precipitate withdrawal of the conquering forces was by superior order of the British Government, or was the spontaneous action of the General. If the latter, Sir Garnet was very undeserving of the high encomiums to which his short and brilliant campaign would otherwise have entitled him. The end was so unworthy of the beginning, and so calculated to neutralize any good result, that we never could conceive it to have been possible that the General in command was wholly responsible for it. The legitimate end of such a war, which ought always to have been kept in view, was to render it impossible that the conquering Power should ever again be called upon for sacrifices of a similar nature. As we pointed out at the time, according to all African rules we had become by conquest sovereigns of the country and its people, and entitled to impose upon them such conditions of future existence as the safety and tranquillity of the Fantee countries might render necessary. Instead of this, we beat a precipitate retreat from Ashanti; and acting toward it as if it had been a civilized Power, we entered into a ""Treaty,"" none of the conditions of which have been complied with, and left it to reorganize itself against us. To us it has always appeared that no man worthy the name of a military commander would have done what Sir Garnet Wolseley did, except under positive orders from his Government. All the circumstances connected with the withdrawal of his army from the conquered territory strengthened us in this opinion, or rather this conviction. It seemed to us as if the order had been, that, if possible, the withdrawal of the troops should take place so that the intelligence of a concluded operation should reach this country on or before the opening of the next Session of Parliament; thus to afford the then Government the power of stating in the Speech from the Throne that a brilliant feat of arms had been performed, and that the war had terminated without any of those deplorable consequences of loss of life from sickness and other causes which its opponents had predicted. It will be in the memory of our readers that the intelligence of the conquest of Coomassie, the Treaty, and the withdrawal of our forces from beyond the River Prah did reach London within a day or two after the re-assembling of the Legislature, when, however, owing to domestic causes, there had been a change of Administration in England; the Earl of Beaconsfield had become Prime Minister instead of Mr. Gladstone. If we are right in this, we hope such a precedent will never be followed. If we choose to have a Colonial Empire—and what should we be without it?—we must accept the position with all its responsibilities, its disadvantages as well as its advantages. To make necessary military operations, undertaken for the defence and security of any portion of that empire, dependent upon the exigencies of home politics; and so dependent that because of those exigencies the results of a brilliant campaign are to be thrown away, and a position accepted very little better than would have happened had our forces been able barely to hold their own, would lead slowly, perhaps, but not less surely, to the ruin first of the Empire and then of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It was to the conditions of power in the city of Rome and at the heart of the Roman Empire that led to the downfall of that colossal Power. Conquests ceased to be consolidated, armies were hastily withdrawn from conquered countries, and from the extremities of the Colonial Empire, to meet exigencies of Imperial rule in Rome and the home provinces, until at length the whole fabric of power collapsed, and Rome became in its turn the prey of invading armies. If Sir John Glover, whose admirable combination of native levies, and march by which he took Coomassie in the rear, had only been allowed to occupy that place for a time, as he desired and petitioned to be allowed to do, the Ashanti countries would have been placed under conditions that would have effectually provided against any such war as that with which the Fantee countries, or rather Great Britain in those countries, has now been again insolently threatened. We say ""threatened,"" for we do not believe in the invasion which the authorities at Cape Coast and Accra, and in its turn the Government at home, have been compelled to provide against as a certainty. We may be wrong, but do not believe that the Ashanti Government has the power to invade, notwithstanding all that has been done and left undone, to enable it to reconstitute itself as the most formidable of all the native States beyond the River Prah. We have said that the authority at Cape Coast has been compelled to provide against the mere symbolical threat of invasion as if the invading armies had been known to be already on the march; but we must say we think the Acting Governor was too ready to take the ""scare,"" unless he acted on the supposition that the Home Government would not adopt the necessary measures for the defence of the protectorate and its people without evidence of a conviction on his part that there was an actual immediate danger, which, of course, would leave them no alternative. We last month expressed our thanks to the Earl of Kimberley for the rapid appointment of Sir Samuel Rowe, as a man eminently fitted to deal with the various problems of the Gold Coast Colony that urgently demand solution. Now, we can only express our regret that he was not already at Cape Coast or Accra when the threatening incident of the Golden Axe occurred. Had he been, we believe that an immense amount of unnecessary alarm and expense would have been spared. Next to this, the knowledge that he is now far on his way out is the best news we could possibly have upon which to comment. Neither a pipe-clay man, a red-tapeist, a timid neophyte, nor a worn-out voluptuary, but a man full of vigour and energy,—never, we think, was a more fitting appointment made than that of Sir Samuel Rowe to be Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony.

Soon afterwards a messenger from Kumassie arrived at Kyebi in due form (i.e., with a gilt sword, as a sign that he is sent by the King of Ashantee), who said that \'the Ashantees will not fight with Ata—they are not Ata\'s enemies.\' But the Akim do not believe him, and keep a strict watch at the frontiers, as it might be a ruse. The messenger further stated: \'Agyemang (the chief of Soedru, who was in former times under Ashantee rule, but withdrew to Akim, and is therefore not a good friend of Ashantee, but attached to the English Government) has killed an Ashantee man, and has stigmatised others by cutting marks in their faces, as the Donkos have them (which are slaves in our country), and has sent them back to Ashantee. He intended to hint to the King of Ashantee that he considers him not better than a despised Donko. This made Kwako Duah, King of Ashantee, angry, who has sent his warriors to catch Agyemang. But this wicked man has run away to Fantee. Therefore Kwako Duah has sent a messenger to Ata, to tell him that he has nothing to fear.\' This is the message.

It appeared to them to be a great pity that our Government should have retired as they did in 1872 without doing anything for the development of the trade there. It was most important for the development of trade and the civilisation of the Natives that we should remain in the country and administer it along with the Gold Coast Colony. We had the French on one side and Germany on the other. He did not want to remark on the administration of either of these countries, but he wished to point out in regard to the hinterland that two or three years ago an expedition, strongly supported by that Chamber, practically annexed the hinterland of Lagos, and since then trade had enormously increased. A new industry in rubber had been started, which promised to attain large dimensions, and the interior was now under an administration of such a character as secured the lives and property of the Natives. They wanted the same thing to be done in connexion with the hinterland of the Gold Coast Colony, and not merely a resident in Coomassie to see that justice was administered in Ashanti.\n\nMr. A. L. Jones seconded the resolution. He thought the present a very suitable time to urge upon the Government the desirability of taking over Ashanti. Nothing could be more ridiculous than the way in which we had dealt with Ashanti in the past. Twenty years ago we sent an expedition there, on which we spent nearly one million sterling, and then we went away and left the place. Now that Mr. Chamberlain was giving attention to British interests in various parts of the world, the present was a very opportune time to press forward the question of the annexation of Ashanti. He knew from a number of officials that such a step was most desirable. These officials held the opinion that the place must absolutely be annexed before they could do any good.

The first report to this effect reached Accra about the 18th of December last, and we believe that at the same time a similar report was officially made by the King of Akim to the Government through the Acting Civil Commandant of this district.\n\nSince that period, the invasion of the Protectorate, as forewarned by the Akims, has unfortunately become an accomplished fact, as we learn from the several proclamations issued by your Honour, and wherein the same is notified to the public; and it is no less true that up to the present moment no measures of preparation for the defence of our district against any incursion of the enemy, or for any offensive operations in co-operation with either of our allies, the Fantis or the Akims, have as yet been adopted by us or for us.\n\nWe, in Accra, more than any other town or tribe within the Protectorate, are dependent upon the protecting power, and we believe, with all due respect, that we are not by any means the least entitled of all the protected tribes to that protection which we have hitherto been led to expect at the hands of the British Government in such crises as the present.\n\nThe authority which was exercised fifty years ago by the Accra chiefs over their people, is now virtually in the hands of the British Government, and the chiefs and headmen do not now possess that power of calling out the inhabitants of the several towns for war purposes that they formerly did, and (which is by far more essential) the pressure already felt by the merchant, European and native, by the present heavy rate of import dues renders it impossible to expect any contribution from them, as in bygone days, for the purpose of obtaining those necessary supplies which would place our kings, our chiefs, and our principal native gentlemen in a position which would entitle them to command the services of the masses in the present emergency.\n\nMoreover, we in Accra labour under another serious disadvantage to which our friends and allies in Cape Coast are not subject, and that is, that all our wants, the most insignificant as well as the most pressing and urgent, have to be referred to Cape Coast before they can be complied with."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-02-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_06_1873#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REPORTED REVOLUTION IN ASHANTI.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The steamship Bonny, which arrived at Liverpool from the West Coast on November 6, brings serious news from the Gold Coast.

The day previous 300 Houssa troops left for the interior, and the day following the Bonny\'s departure Colonel Scott was himself to leave with 200 men more.

With the successful close of the military operations which have been found necessary in the Gambia, and the ready acceptance of the terms which were placed before the Jebus, we may hope that a more peaceful future lies before British intercourse, commercial and social, with the Natives, than has been the case during the past few years.

Ten years ago the German Colonial policy had no existence, and the great speed with which the resuscitated German Empire set about the task of founding and developing a Colonial Empire has not been without its visible drawbacks, in the lack of experience in government which has, both in the East and West of the Dark Continent, gone a long way towards damping their ardour in forming a vast Teutonic Empire in Africa. Even more difficult than the task before the Germans is that which confronts the French in West Africa. The existence of the uncivilised and independent kingdom of Dahomey has long been regarded as one of the great difficulties in the way of the peaceful development of the West Coast; and the conflict which has been forced upon the French Government is one which in some form or other was inevitable.

He justified the King of Ashanti in desiring free communication with the Coast, and was of opinion that the transfer of the Castle of Elmina, or rather the way in which it was done, without the privity of the King of Ashanti, was the real cause of the war, which a little straightforward explanation might have averted. He considered that the King of Ashanti was quite right in the view which he took of the matter, as he was practically barred from communication with the Coast. He characterized the course of the Government immediately after the transfer as a mistake which was likely to cost a couple of millions, besides many lives. He did not, however, think the English would be justified in abandoning the post, but thought the position gained by the English at the end of the present hostilities, if they are successful, would be beneficial, inasmuch as the whole Protectorate would be under one flag. Still, he preferred retiring from the Gold Coast to continuing the course of protecting a system of pillage and persecution. Had a proper policy been pursued, the English might have had a valuable ally in the King of Ashanti, instead of spending a couple of millions, besides lives, in fighting him. He believed that the proper course for England was to do what she had never yet done—namely, to use her increased prestige in putting down, with a high hand, all monopolies and obstructions to free commerce on the Coast.

At Lagos there were plenty of cotton and palm oil awaiting the chances of shipment.\n\nIn consequence of the markets being reopened at Benin, oil was coming in freely to the different establishments.\n\nFrom the Western Districts of the Gold Coast, it is stated that since the exchange of territories, notwithstanding the troubles connected with it, the palm-oil trade had increased, the increase in the exports being over 140,000l.

He also suggests that all property seized by either side should be exchanged. It was also stated that the famous Ashantee Chief, Quaguah (who negotiated the treaty with Governor Maclean for the surrender of all refugees) was about to be sent as ambassador. Governor Nagtglas was also sending back to Coomassie, through Assinnee, the Ashantees at Elmina.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

The way in which they have finally resisted the advance of the little handful of British troops and native allies upon their capital, fully justifies the reputation they had obtained for personal bravery and military skill; while the uselessness of their resistance shows how completely all those countries in West Africa, within a hundred or two hundred miles of the sea-coast, are at the command of the civilized powers of Europe, of whom Great Britain alone has taken any real interest in their affairs. After the evidence which the Ashanti expedition has supplied, there cannot be a doubt—and there ought not to be a doubt in the mind of any native African authority—that 5,000 British troops, supposing they could be made secure from the evil influences of climate, and that they could obtain proper food and means of conveying sufficient ammunition, could traverse native Africa from east to west and from north to south, everywhere triumphant. Is not this a great lesson for West African potentates and other native authorities? The King of Dahomey will do well to take it seriously to heart, when meditating another grand diabolical ""custom,"" with its unspeakably horrifying human sacrifices; or another inroad into the Egba territory, in pursuance of his insane ambition or revenge against Abeokuta. Abomey is not more than half the distance from Whydah that Kumasi is from Cape Coast, and the country is much more accessible, open, and practicable for a body of troops. Christian Europe—now that Ashanti horrors have been so fully exposed, and, we will venture to hope, put an end to—will not much longer tolerate similar and even worse practices in Dahomey. We, at least, will do our part, that they shall not. If Great Britain does not interfere to put an end to them, some other European power will take possession of Whydah, and do so. It would be a conquest rich in mercantile results, while invaluable in the cause of outraged humanity and not a little important as regards facilities for introducing to the knowledge of those great truths, which can alone successfully combat and destroy the debasing and destructive sway of Satan, so long supreme over the vast countries of West and Central Africa. While thus giving warning to Dahomey, we should be greatly wanting in our duty if we did not give a word of advice—and we would have it looked upon as a large one—to our friends, the Egbas and Jebus. Our friendship for Abeokuta is too well known and has been too well evidenced for any one to deny or dispute it; we have given many and great proofs of it, and, therefore, we ought not to be misunderstood, when, with all our heart, we counsel and advise the authorities there and in Jebu, not to raise or prolong causes of contention with the British authorities in Lagos; or put forward pretensions which the well-known and, even in West Africa, sufficiently well understood principles by which British action and government is guided, must prevent her listening to. Egba, Jebu, their kings, authorities, and peoples, have nothing to fear from Great Britain, while they cultivate friendly relations with her Government in Lagos, and do all they can to facilitate and extend their trade with that place. But—and let them lay this well to heart—they can never be safe if they choose to pick quarrels with the Lagos Government. If this does wrong to them at any time, they may be sure that such is not the wish or intention of the Queen’s Government in England; and their representations, if made directly to it in a proper manner, will be sure to receive attention, because they will be seconded by us and other friends of Africa. We see a great and proud future for Abeokuta, and the Egba and Jebu countries generally, if they will but comprehend their true interests, and show themselves ready to second the English desires for the extension and development of trade and resources in them and beyond them. We have a mental view—we can see that future in our mind, though native African prejudice may prevent it from becoming a reality for yet a short time—we have a mental view of a good road, and soon after, even a rail or tram road, from the Lagoon, through Abeokuta, to Ibadan, in one direction, and to the Niger at Rabba, in another. These would make Abeokuta the great interior emporium of trade with the whole of that vast African interior, from the sea-side to the Niger, and the further side of that river; and Lagos, the great shipping port for all the produce—a hundred, aye, and many a hundredfold more than passes through her at this present time. This is an eventuality that must and will be realized. No opposition that native Africa can show, will prevent the progress of that great march of trade and commerce, which caters for the wants, and fulfils the demands of the civilized world that the natural resources of the whole earth shall be developed, and the products be made to minister to its use and enjoyment; while, in return, it imports its civilization and its wealth. The people of Jebu and Abeokuta do not at present comprehend the great advantage they have in Lagos being a British settlement. They do not seem to be conscious of the importance of the fact that this secures them at all times, upon certain and easy conditions, a safe port for their trade—a full security that the trade which must in time make Egba and Jebu, with their industrious populations, fat with wealth and riches, can never be interfered with by any other power; whereas, if Great Britain were not there, there is more than one other that might and would seek to conquer and keep possession of those countries, the undeveloped wealth and future possible importance of which is at last beginning to be understood and appreciated in Europe. No man can be a friend to Egba and Jebu who does not advise and entreat them to be always close friends with Lagos and its British authorities. Whatever his pretensions may be, if he counsel them to any other policy, any other course than this, he must be their enemy. In close alliance and friendship with Great Britain at Lagos, they have, as before observed, not only a happy present, but a glorious future before them—a future in which Great Britain will largely assist, and to which, without her friendship and aid, they can never attain. Close friendship with England means no more attacks by Dahomey; but possibly a subjection of Dahomey to Abeokuta. With the close friendship and alliance of Great Britain, this, and much more than this, is possible to a strong and determined people such as are the Egbas; while without it, they can never be free from uncertainty and danger.', 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

Rajestera, an officer at the front, recalled the dissension and strife in the army when he wrote: 'There was a feeling of discouragement on all sides, as much among the ranks as among their chiefs, especially when it was learnt that, although the Prime Minister's relatives and friends, and especially his grandson, Ratsimanisa, had discreetly remained behind in Imerina, they were sharing in the honours which ought rightly to have been bestowed on those who had to suffer the fatigue and dangers of the war'. The announcement that Ratsimanisa, of whom the officers dis› paragingly spoke as being 'a mere boy who no sooner wakes up than he falls asleep again and is just about fit to grill sweet potatoes', had been elevated to the rank of the 'Fifteen Honours', one of the highest in the hierarchy, was the last straw that sapped morale and blunted the resistance. 1 7 In view of this situation, General Duchesne, commander-in-chief of the French expeditionary corps, detached a light column from the main body of the army, which was bogged down by its sick and its carts and equipment. This column drove the queen's regular troops before it and put them to flight before taking Antananarivo on 30 September 1895.

In Tripolitania, the Italians won over to their side the Ibädites of the Djabal Nafusa, who were opposed to the Sunnï majority in the country.

In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation.

The Sierra Leone coast is known to be rich, especially in indiarubber. It is there the work of the Expedition will commence, and new processes for the extraction and manufacture of this article will be put into operation. The Expedition will then proceed to Sherbro', the Kroo Coast, the Grain, Ivory, and Gold Coasts, thence through the Bight of Benin to Old Calabar and the oil rivers, and efforts will be made to open up new trade all along the route. Lagos will receive the special attention of the Expedition, and it is with regard to this portion of the Continent that Mr. James Bennett's Government appointment specially applies. The commercial portion of the enterprise will specially devote itself to the formation of centres for the rubber trade, and depôts will be opened for bartering purposes. Coal, iron, and other minerals will be searched for, and it is believed they will be found in abundance. The Expedition will direct its operations inland, but not to a great extent, the object being to open up trade with those portions of the country where transit to the sea is easy, and products can be brought within a few weeks' sail of English ports. The vessel in which the party travels will carry a powerful steam launch, a large life boat, and two small gigs.\n\nThe Colonial Office, understanding that the objects of Mr. Bennett's expedition are not of a merely scientific character, as had been supposed, has withdrawn the introductions to the Governors of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Gold Coast colonies; and Commander Lovett Cameron has informed...\n\nMr. Bennett that he must sever himself from the expedition.

Du Chaillu, who had devoted the whole of the little fortune realised by the sale of his book to fit out a little vessel suited for his purpose. When he arrived out he had to wait for instruments, but did not waste his time, since he sent gorillas and plenty of other curiosities to the British Museum. When he reached the interior the small-pox broke out among the natives, and as they considered that he and his party had brought the disease among them, dissensions followed. M. Du Chaillu had encountered great difficulties, but he (the speaker) was not yet well informed as to their nature. However, he had received a telegram from M.

He justified the King of Ashanti in desiring free communication with the Coast, and was of opinion that the transfer of the Castle of Elmina, or rather the way in which it was done, without the privity of the King of Ashanti, was the real cause of the war, which a little straightforward explanation might have averted. He considered that the King of Ashanti was quite right in the view which he took of the matter, as he was practically barred from communication with the Coast. He characterized the course of the Government immediately after the transfer as a mistake which was likely to cost a couple of millions, besides many lives. He did not, however, think the English would be justified in abandoning the post, but thought the position gained by the English at the end of the present hostilities, if they are successful, would be beneficial, inasmuch as the whole Protectorate would be under one flag. Still, he preferred retiring from the Gold Coast to continuing the course of protecting a system of pillage and persecution. Had a proper policy been pursued, the English might have had a valuable ally in the King of Ashanti, instead of spending a couple of millions, besides lives, in fighting him. He believed that the proper course for England was to do what she had never yet done—namely, to use her increased prestige in putting down, with a high hand, all monopolies and obstructions to free commerce on the Coast.

Now, Elmina alone remains; a very little portion in which the inhabitants reside is called by the natives ""Garden.""

The French nation has not shown much interest in this war: which has not even provoked enough criticism to be made a weapon of party controversy. They seem generally to have found no less difficulty in understanding its use or reason than the King of Dahomey himself whose request to President Carnot for enlightenment was published some weeks ago.

Their offer of peace was received by the dusky potentate as a ""submission."" He proceeded to burn villages in the district of Porto Novo, and has so far damaged the prospects of that colony, that one might have supposed, if only for the sake of French prestige, it would be necessary to take action.

There are doubtless other reasons also, which are deterrent. France had no very pleasant experiences in Madagascar and Tonquin to induce her to enter upon another petty war under even more adverse circumstances. There was further as recompense for trouble and expenditure in these two cases some hope of substantial success.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings.

They were paid such low sums that some refused to take them. This African response was not against growing cotton as such, which they had willingly started growing as a cash crop.

So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops.

In Uganda, shortly after the commencement of hostilities, Nyindo, Paramount Chief of Kigezi, was persuaded by his half-brother, the Mwami of Ruanda, to revolt against the British on behalf of the Germans. 43 In many cases, and notably Nigeria, wartime revolts were not directly attributable to specific wartime measures.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.662, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy', 'section_title': 'Capital and coercion, c. 1900-f. 1920', 'content': ""Colonial states discriminated with regard to the types of force which they sanctioned in their colonies. Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'Among the social effects of foreign rule on African society, the most immediately noticeable was the political one.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

Cutting across the lineage system of non-centralized societies, a variety of integrative institutions developed in the religious, judicial and economic fields which could function as an overall framework of order or replace a disintegrating state-system.$^{25}$ The poro and similar associations in Upper Guinea, or various so-called 'secret societies' in the Cross river and equatorial forest areas of the Cameroons and Gabon are examples.

Something, during the night, had disagreed with the judicial stomach, for next day, or the day after, in Court, the magistrates were in a bunch stigmatised as corrupt and unworthy; the commandant a——; the pleaders little removed from footpads; and Accra, generally and especially, going galloping to the bad. What was to be done to bring about a reform? One magistrate was lugged out of his bed at eleven o\'clock at night, and cast into prison in company with a couple of felons, on a charge of having assisted a quiet and inoffensive married lady to break into the prison. He was released, however, in the morning, being told ""it was entirely a mistake."" All the local magistrates in a body at once sent in their resignations. Some respectable residents were imprisoned on various charges—of holding domestic slaves, of having domestic slaves in their possession, or having disposed of them, or bought, or inherited, or kidnapping, or pawning, &c.

The chief object of the officers is to get rubber and ivory at any price rather than to civilise, and they make no scruples in setting one tribe against another, using the stronger as a catspaw to obtain the ivory from the weaker. Great loss of life is the result, and it is no wonder we hear at intervals of officers being massacred. In addition to the ivory in the Native villages, the river is closely watched. A canoe laden with ivory is seen coming down the river in the evening, and signals are made for the Natives to stop and bring in their goods on the usual terms—that is to say, at a much lower price than could be obtained from any independent trader. Of course, the Natives paddle away as fast as possible, whereupon they are at once fired on and either killed or compelled to bring in their ivory. Another serious matter—one which is attracting the attention of the British Government—is the wholesale recruiting by Belgian agents of British subjects in Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Barbadoes. Although, as the result of representations made to the Colonial Governments concerned this is being gradually suppressed, at one time almost every ship brought a number of men who had entered into contracts with the State to act as labourers. Once in the Congo the word ""travailleur"" was erased, and ""soldat"" substituted. Comparatively few of these people ever return to the coast. They die in the interior, usually of starvation. The result of all this is that hundreds of miles of the country are desolate, and that the Natives are leaving for the French sphere.\n\nIt is only fair to say that the high officials on the coast are not wholly responsible for this, and that some slight attempt is made at Boma, for instance, to educate the children, and so forth. The interior is in a constant state of siege, and legitimate trade is stagnated. There can be no doubt that had the Congo people the power of cohesion, the Belgians would have long since been swept out of the country, and that the British and other foreigners, who are all classed as whites, would have shared a similar fate. The suspicion entertained by one tribe of another is the Belgians\' only safety.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Critical Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Murphy next proceeded to give incidents of the barbarities alleged to have been perpetrated by the State for the purpose of obtaining rubber; and observes that some radical change in government must take place before there can be any hope of prosperity. It may well be supposed that the country is in a disturbed state. The people of the district of Lake Mantumba, of Irebu, and Lokolala and all the Mobangi towns have crossed over to the French side. Going over to the French side meant that they would become homeless and hungry wanderers. Even then the State could not leave them in peace; they heard that they came over at night to their old homes to get food, and they stationed canoes and lay in wait for them, with orders to shoot all they caught, and to my knowledge they shot seven people in one night. The State is strong enough to-day to do these things because the people lack unity. They have no leaders, no common cause, and no weapons to fight. Their condition is deplorable, and needs our sympathy, as well as all that European public opinion can do to secure for them the blessings of a righteous government under which they can live in peace.\n\nRegarding the State officers and their manner of administration, Mr. Murphy said: ""The white officers do not know the language of the people they govern, and trust too much to their Native soldiers, who are, as a rule, men belonging to a hostile tribe, whose chief aim in life is to plunder. These men are sent out to fight very often without any responsible officer being with them, with the result that many cruelties are perpetrated which might have been avoided. It is impossible for the Governor at Boma—four weeks\' journey from Stanley Pool, which ought to be the real seat of Government—to manage his vast and unwieldy territory, so that the commissaires and petty governors of the interior districts have almost unlimited power. The officers of the State are young and inexperienced; they do not come out as colonists to develop the country, but in order that they may receive quick promotion, the Congo decoration, and, above all, to get money.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-12-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_12_1895#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.644, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

""A young man, by name Moses (R. E. Moses), purchased a cask or two of rum from one of the wholesale merchants in this town. At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently). Armed with the receipt for the money tendered in payment of a licence, Mr. Moses proceeds to open his shop, and commences the sale of spirituous liquors. An hour or two afterwards, the very official (one Brown, a discharged soldier) who had received the money and given the receipt, happening to be passing that way, enters Mr. Moses\' new shop, and, to use his own words, ""\'ave\'s a drink."" He then returns to his office, and despatches two or three constables to seize Mr. Moses and take possession of his shop for selling spirits without a licence; the young man is brought before the sitting magistrate, also a soldier, \'but this time a gentleman.\' Moses produces witnesses to prove that his shop had never been opened until the day the receipt for the licence-money was dated; but ""orders are peremptory,"" and Mr. Moses is condemned to one month\'s imprisonment with hard labour, for attempting to defraud the revenue in selling rum without a licence.—Yours, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-07-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1866#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.655, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I met in St. Louis an English-born Freetown negress who told me that, having a dispute about property in Freetown, she had gone to law there. She won her case, a simple one, but the costs in it ruined her. The poor woman said to me that the English were very bad to the natives. ""Very bad man, sar, Englishman, drink too much whisky, take all poor negro money, get drunk, go back to England; bad man, Englishman. I come here, Frenchman very good man; he no kick poor black, rob, and call him dam nigger.""\n\nThere is no safety for personal property in Freetown, as the native police stand guard whilst their countrymen break into houses and stores. The native landlord of the ""hotel"" in which I put up once came to me in the dead of night and asked me if I had heard a noise below. They were breaking into his spirit stores, he said. I was about to rush down, but he persuaded me not to do so, unless I wanted a ""knife into me"" or my head broken by the robbers and by the police, who were sure to be with them, he said. The police court and station were just opposite, and her Majesty\'s gaol in close proximity. Listening, we heard the thieves looting the place; and, after they had decamped and were safely away, not before, we descended, to find the door cleverly broken open and every demijohn of liquor gone. On asking the proprietor whether he was not going to complain to the European police magistrate, he replied, ""What is the use? My complaining will do no good. I shall get no redress; but one thing I should be sure to get, namely, the ill-will of the police."" This is a specimen of British rule in Sierra Leone and West Africa generally. I could multiply similar cases and worse to an indefinite extent. Yet the number of officials in Freetown and the cost of civil administration is enormous. In the adjoining territory the French administer the country\'s affairs 700 per cent. cheaper than it costs the English. In the capital of Sierra Leone there are eighty-four salaried officials, whose aggregate pay amounts to £16,764 15s. 6d. per annum, or 6s. 8½d. per head of the population, plus 8s. 3½d. per head, the cost of six months\' leave of absence to England on full pay, with free passage out and back, for every year of service. This enormous expenditure is exclusive of the military, medical, and commissariat departments, which considerably more than double the 10s. per head. One European merchant in Freetown informed me that he paid over £5,000 a year in taxes alone to the civil administration; and as there are other merchants of the same standing, we find that, together with all the other taxes, licenses to drinking-dens and grog-shops, the Local Government\'s annual income is thousands in excess of expenditure, startling as that expenditure may be. And yet the Imperial Government say the Colony is in debt to them, and they heartily wish it at the bottom of the sea. What, then, becomes of the money? Where does it go?', 'last_edit_date': '1891-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1891#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Internal Condition of the Congo Free State', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'According to a statement made to a representative of Reuter\'s Agency by a missionary who has lately returned from the Congo, things must be in a very parlous state there. The substance of the statement is appended, but our readers need hardly be reminded that as the name of the missionary is not made public the account must be accepted with much caution. The whole truth, he says, regarding the situation on the Congo can never be made public by anyone who has to return there. The State officers are so far from any central control that if they heard that the missionaries, for instance, had said anything, they would retaliate by attacking the Natives round the stations, even if the white men were not themselves hurt. As to the Stokes affair. I know nothing personally of that incident. I do know Captain Lothaire, however, and therefore was not surprised. He, in common with a few other State officers who could be named, is held in special awe by the Natives. The people on the Lulanga River called him ""Lofembe,"" meaning mist, by reason of his mysterious movements. Lothaire is by no means the worst of the Congo officers, as there are many in the State service who have a still worse reputation among the Natives. The following is a specimen of Captain Lothaire\'s actions. Some four years ago he arrived with some black troops at a point opposite the mission station of Eulongo. Finding the Natives had fled on hearing of his approach, he pitched his camp on an island facing the station, and sent over to the missionary asking him to use his influence to get the Natives back, and promising a three days\' truce in order to hold a palaver. The missionary, supposing he was dealing with an officer and a gentleman, induced the Natives to come into the station. As soon as they did so, Lothaire and his men opened fire on them and killed a number. Naturally, the Natives attributed this treachery to the missionaries, and later, when Lothaire sent word to another mission station that he was about to visit it, the missionary warned the Natives around the station not to return if they were sent for. One important thing connected with the Stokes affair seems to have been overlooked. It is that Stokes had been robbed of a caravan worth £4,000, and it is quite likely that many of the arms found by the State officers on the Natives formed part of the booty. This being so, it is scarcely probable that the people would admit having stolen them, but would be much more likely to declare that they had got them from the British trader. This might happen in the case of any trading or mission station being looted by the Natives, as materials for purposes of shooting game, as well as for defence, are always kept in readiness, including perhaps a thousand cartridges. If these were found on the Natives the State officials might as readily declare that they had got them from the British. This does not affect the action of Captain Lothaire one way or the other, but it throws an important side light on the affair.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1895#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

Over large areas drink is almost the sole currency, and in many parts the year\'s wages of the negro factory worker are paid altogether in spirits.\n\nWe read with shame and alarm the wanton acts of misgovernment, which are of periodical, if not constant, occurrence on the West Coast of Africa, from the Gambia down to the mouth of the Niger and the Oil Rivers District. The thousands of lives sacrificed during the past few years in mischievous raids upon native tribes cannot be restored, nor can the scandal be atoned for of lawless floggings and tortures inflicted by English officials, who appear to have discarded all the qualities proper to Englishmen upon taking service in the Gold Coast or Sierra Leone Constabulary.\n\nIn the Gold Coast Colony a Government official gave twenty natives, who were suspected of complicity in a theft, seventy-two lashes apiece, from which flogging four of them died.

This traffic is actually increasing, owing to the apathy of her Majesty\'s Government.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The imposition of European bureaucratic structures disrupted traditional governance, leading to further fragmentation and insecurity. However, the text also notes the resilience of localized kinship and community networks, suggesting variations in the extent of lawlessness across regions. Complementing this, The African Times articles provide instances of violence and lack of authority, such as the thwarting of the Dutch Ladies' Expedition by slave traders on the White Nile and the government's inability to enforce law and order in the Accra District. Traders on the River Volta faced plunder and threats, and the inadequacy of police forces in places like Bathurst and the Gambia allowed unchecked criminal activities. Despite these challenges, the articles mention efforts by authorities to address issues, such as arresting unruly chiefs and deploying naval forces, indicating attempts at governance.

These took advantage of the internal decay of the existing structures to establish themselves, before being swept away in their turn by foreign powers that were even more formidable.\nThere can be no single explanation for this kind of decline, such as might be offered if it were seen solely in terms of external influences, or as part of a predisposition towards colonization. There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest. Although none of them achieved this on any lasting basis, in each case the high point of their power coincided with their maximum north-south extension, even though the nucleus of the Bambara empire of Segu kept more closely to its west-east axis of the- valley of the Niger. However, during the nineteenth century, political instability and popu- lation movements were widespread. Brutal massacres and secessionist movements were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority, such as the Tondyon of Segu and the ministers of the court of Wagadugu.

To a certain extent this power vacuum reflected the past inability of many Central African societies to organize or sustain a centralized political system. Many of the Lunda and Shona states had also undergone a process of political fractionalization. North of the Zambezi, the slave trade intensified internal rivalries in the kingdoms of the Lunda of Kazembe, Undi, Kalonga and Lundu that left them vulnerable to the seditious activities and attacks of the slave traders and their Nguni counterparts. To the south, cleavages within the Shona aristocracy, coupled with the devastating raids of the Zwangendaba and Gaza Nguni, substantially weakened the regional powers. The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states. While these new military states were undoubt› edly stronger than the polities they had vanquished, the subject peoples often perceived them as alien interlopers and resented their authoritarian rule.

Three major develop› ments flowed from this: first, the new trade led to an increase in the internal slave trade to supply the manpower requirements of the delta states; second, the growth of new Houses and Heads resulted in the disturbance of the internal political balance (Dike's slave revolts) and, third, competition for the hinterland markets led to several wars between the delta states."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > The western and southern Volta plateaux', 'content': 'In this region, lineage groups and clans that for the most part lacked centralized power stood up rather well to the upheavals of the time.

It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.595, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 455, 'article_title': 'THE WHITE NILE', 'full_section_title': 'THE WHITE NILE', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1864#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_09_1864', 'content': 'We learn also by a communication from Mr. J.

Two of the most influential traders—viz., Biselli and Ali Amouri, seem to have been the great culprits. After stating the straits to which they were reduced, owing to the perfidious conduct of these slavetraders, Mr. Tinne says that one of the ladies in their letter goes on to state how negroes were beaten, and in some cases shot, for attempting to relieve them; that Ali Abu Amouri, when applied to for help, refused to give it except upon terms equally outrageous with those of Biselli, and also forbade his negroes to sell to or assist them in any way. Selim also, Ali\'s steward, robbed them in every way possible, and encouraged his men to do so too. Their people attempted to build huts to spend the rainy season in, but Biselli refused the help of his negroes, without which help they could not get materials. M. von Henglin, a well-known scientific traveller who accompanied the expedition, confirms this, and gives particulars of other very atrocious acts. He states that a soldier of his party had bought four elephants\' tusks from a native sheik; on learning which fact the people of the merchant Ali Abu Amouri attacked the negroes, took the sheik and several others prisoners, and killed the sheik\'s wife. The captured negroes would be sold as slaves. M. Kleinzinik, another traveller, had sent them about fifteen porters from a neighbouring station, Roulanda, with corn bought from the merchant Biselli, but having arrived near Biselli\'s zeriba, they were arrested by one of his dragomen, who forced the negroes with threats to return with their loads. They next attempted to buy corn from the tribes of the Niam-Niams; and a sheik was bringing them a good supply, when they were met by men of Ali Abu Amouri, who put both the negroes and Henglin\'s soldiers in irons, and took them to the zeriba of Ali, where the soldiers were at last released, but the negroes detained as slaves, and three of their number, who had escaped, were retaken and shot.

We need scarcely remind your Excellency that in the year 1858 Her Majesty's Government ordered a detachment of West India troops, under a commanding officer, to station here, in order to quell the disturbances which were then raging, as the merchants, traders, &c., carrying on legitimate trade were maltreated; and since the withdrawal of the troops at that period, not a vestige of Great Britain's power remained to crush the wicked deeds which are daily perpetrated, except the Custom House officer, who is not vested with judicial authority.

Both sides repudiate the so-called peace, and are still at war; but the Awoonlahs act on the offensive and the other on the defensive; the ""Blackall Peace"" having no existence, except on the paper by which Mr. Ussher proclaims King Cudjoe an outlaw for daring to defend his country when invaded.\n\nIt would be instructive to know what report has been furnished to the Government at home relative to the present state of the country. It is difficult to believe that they can be in possession of the real facts without making some effort to mend matters. The Awoonlahs have at the time I write entire command of the navigation of the Volta, from Aquamboe to Addah, and entire possession of all the paths to Krepee, the great cotton country of the Gold Coast. Most of the native merchants have been ruined by not being able to convey their cotton from Krepee to a place of safety on this side of the Volta. Several have made attempts to get a quantity down, but where one succeeds in obtaining a bale or two nine fail—that is, their goods are plundered, and the carriers are either barbarously murdered or sold into slavery by the Awoonlahs. Not native merchants alone have been sufferers, but Europeans also. H. L. Rottmann and Co., of Christiansborg, have had unpleasant experience of the delusiveness of the Blackall peace.

A very serious one as regards the general population seems to be, the inefficiency of the police force, and the monopoly of the little service they are capable of rendering by a certain limited district of the town, to the entire abandonment of the other portions. The police being paid out of the colonial revenue, even were higher considerations set aside, it is a matter of mere pecuniary justice that the services they render should be general, not partial.

That the property of the merchants demands full protection, there can be no doubt; but it is most unjust that those portions of the town inhabited by the coloured population should therefore be left a prey to the lawless and violent, who are to be found in all communities. It is not only unjust, but it is a most short-sighted policy—if such practices can be dignified by the name of policy—because if violence and plunder be carried on with impunity throughout the greater portion of the town, the result will infallibly be the establishing of a criminal population that will in a short time be too strong for the police in the favoured street.

It is true that the export in this locality is almost, although not entirely, kept under by the vigilance of the squadron, but this is only effected by keeping a number of men-of-war (there were six in December last) anchored within two miles of the coast, at short distances from each other, with armed boats in the intervals; an arrangement entailing the severest and most trying duties on the officers and men employed, and attaining its partial success only at very great cost to the country.\n\nIf the present trade of the settlements be compared with that of any other British possessions, it is not certainly of any great moment; but, such as it is, it owes its continuance mainly to the encouragement and protection which their presence affords it.

He has within the last two months sent a force from this station to Mumford, a place fifty miles up the Coast, near Winnebah, to arrest the chiefs and captains of that place, who had turned out their people and fought together, killing some forty or fifty persons. This matter was accomplished without trouble by the Civil Commandant of Accra, Mr. Bolton, assisted by a military force under Captain Ness, of the 2nd West India Regiment. The Mumford chiefs are still in prison awaiting trial. More recently the Administrator sent these two officers to Pram Pram and Ningo, the two most unruly towns on the Coast, and they succeeded in bringing up the chiefs, and some other persons, from those places as prisoners to Accra. The Ningos have for the last sixteen years openly committed human sacrifices, and defied every Governor in succession. In 1855, an expedition was got up with the view of bringing them to their senses for roasting three men alive on no charge at all; but the expedition never started. Since that time two dozen such murders have taken place, but the Government contented itself with writing a letter to the chiefs not to kill any one else! Even last year a case occurred.

The result was that throughout the nineteenth century, and even during the early part of this century, the new and old elites built up a tradition of co-operation - the new elite being regarded as those who mediated between their indigenous societies and western culture. After all they had been enabled to learn the new techniques in order to help their people meet the problems posed by European presence. In the Gold Coast and in Egbaland (Nigeria) they had worked closely with the traditional elite in an effort to build a new society and ward off European rule. But these efforts had failed.\nHowever, as colonial rule took deeper root, strains and stresses appeared in the relationship of the two groups. The new elites had wrongly hoped that Europe was out to modernize Africa and would use members of their group as the instruments for achieving that goal. But under colonial rule it was European bureaucrats who assumed the role which the new elites had cut out for themselves. And instead of taking the new elites into partnership, the administration tended to prefer the traditional rulers whom they relegated to the area of local government. This was particularly so in British-ruled Africa where a determined effort was made to preserve the old ruling families and to some extent in Belgian-ruled Africa after 1906. Even in the French territories where most of the great paramountcies were destroyed, the old ruling families at times survived in attenuated forms to be used at the village and district levels.

The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

The fact was that, as Professor Wallerstein has aptly put it, migration from 'the traditional rural to the modern urban area' led to 'dislocation and disorientation for the indivi› dual'.$^{8}$ Since neither the traditional society nor the colonial administration had the means to step in and meet the new needs of such migrants, they had to evolve their own institutions, systems and norms for achieving meaningful existence in the strange and heady social world of the town.\nThe studies of Godfrey Wilson in East Africa have shown that there was a clear correlation between the pressure of colonial society and the formation of these organizations. Thus Kenyan Africans, whose traditional culture came under unusually severe pressure from colonial rule and settler aggressiveness, had stronger and much more numerous ethnic associations than Africans in neighbouring territories like Tanganyika and Uganda. There was thus an element of individual self-protection and selfstabilization in the formation of the associations. Furthermore, urban conditions of existence created opportunities that made it relatively easy to form such organizations since, as Thomas Hodgkin has put it, it provided 'physical centres ... where men and women, with particular interests in common, can collide with one another'. 9"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.721, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': 'Nor is the \'traditional-modern\' polar model, with all its attendant implications of conflict and incompatibility, applicable to the entire spectrum of African experience of change under colonialism. There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity. The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""The final beneficial social impact was the new social structure that colonialism introduced into some parts of Africa or whose development it accelerated in other parts. As A. E. Afigbo has pointed out (Chapter 19), though the traditional social structure allowed for social mobility, its class structure appeared to give undue weight to birth. The new colonial order on the other hand, emphasized individual merit and achievement rather than birth. This change together with the abolition of slavery, the intro› duction of western education, Christianity and Islam, the expansion of cash-crop agriculture which facilitated the acquisition of wealth in some areas and the many other avenues for advancement that the new colonial order introduced, radically altered the traditional social structure. Thus, by the 1930s, in place of the pre-colonial social classes of the traditional ruling aristocracy, the ordinary people, domestic slaves and a relatively small educated elite, had emerged a new society that had become more sharply divided than before into urban and rural dwellers, each of which was differently stratified. The urban dwellers had become divided into three main sub-groups: the elite or as others call them the administrativeclerical-professional bourgeoisie; the non-elite or, as Lloyd prefers to call them, the sub-elite, and the urban proletariat. The elite was subdivided into three groups: the bureaucratic elite of civil servants, the professional elite of doctors, lawyers, architects, surveyors, professors, etc., and the commercial elite of managers of the expatriate firms and companies and private traders and businessmen. The sub-elite consisted of brokers, middlemen, clerks, teachers, nurses and junior civil servants, while the urban proletariat consisted of the wage-earners, store assistants, drivers, mechanics, messengers, tailors, bricklayers, etc. In the rural areas, there emerged for the first time in many parts of Africa new classes, namely, a rural proletariat of landless Africans, and peasants. The former consisted of those Africans especially in East and Southern Africa, whose lands had been alienated by the Europeans but who were not allowed to reside permanently in the urban and industrial centres and were therefore com› pelled to spend their lives shunting between the urban and rural areas, mainly as migrant labourers.

The phenomenal growth of the population of the urban centres that we noted above was not the result of the natural increase of the urban population but rather of what has been described as 'push-pull forces',$^{32}$ the continuous pull of young men and women to the urban centres by the need for education and employ› ment and the push from the rural areas, as C. Coquery-Vidrovitch has shown above (Chapter 15), by famine, epidemic, poverty and taxation. Moreover, since the Europeans tended to live in the urban centres, all those facilities that improved the quality of life enumerated above were established only in those areas. The rural areas were therefore virtually neglected, which, in turn, accentuated the drift from one to the other. A huge gap exists even today between urban and rural areas in Africa and there is no doubt that it was the colonial system that originated and widened this gap.\nNor did the migrants find the urban centres the safe and rich haven that they had expected. In no town were the Africans accepted as equals and fully integrated. Moreover, nowhere did a majority of them find jobs or decent accommodation. Most of them found themselves crowded into the suburbs and the shanty towns in which unemployment, juvenile delin› quency, drunkenness, prostitution, crime and corruption became their lot.

Secondly, the new classes created by colonialism and 'founded on western criteria of schooling and civilization, instead of on the African criteria of wealth and prestige'$^{57}$ are bound to remain and in fact increase in complexity. Already, two new groups have been added since independence. One is the political elite made up of the leading members of the political parties that have been mushrooming in Africa and who have become the prime ministers, presidents, ministers, ambassadors, etc. The other is the military elite made up of present and ex-officers of the armed forces of each independent state. The members of these elite groups are definitely different from the people of the rural areas in terms of their dress, life style, tastes and status. Now, had these elite groups constituted a good percentage of the population of Africa, one would have accepted their formation as yet another crucial and fundamental change introduced by colonialism. But as indicated already, the urban or elitist groups constituted by the end of the colonial era only a small fraction of the population, at most about 20%. The remaining people were the rural dwellers who remained predominantly illiterate and maintained their traditional beliefs, values and standards.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization.

The deaths of his mother and his wife followed very closely the one on the other. First, on the 10th April last, a beloved mother, aged 82, was taken away—Mary Edith, relict of the late Rev. Anthony Elliott. In this loving family the death of its most aged member was deeply felt by all. It was but the prelude, however, to a still heavier affliction. Susan, the beloved wife, was soon summoned to join the beloved mother in the realms of eternal bliss. On the 14th of May, when engaged in some arrangements for her daughter\'s approaching wedding, which had been fixed to take place on the 19th of May, she felt the first indications of illness; and on that 19th of May—the very day appointed for the wedding—she fell asleep in Jesus. Daughter of the late Hon. Wm. Cole, merchant and Member of Council at Sierra Leone, she had been during thirty-two years the tenderly-beloved wife of Mr. J. B. Elliott, to whom she bore thirteen children, six of whom still survive. She was 50 years of age, and had been a member of Lady Huntingdon\'s church at Sierra Leone for above thirty years. Her bereaved husband, writing of her sudden death, says, ""She was the mainspring of the family, hard-working, and training up her children in the fear of God."" And there can be no doubt that, not only as a devoted wife, a fond mother, and a sincere friend, but also as a member of the Christian community of Sierra Leone, her loss will be deeply felt. But we hope it will not have been for one moment forgotten that their loss was her eternal gain, and that since ""it has been appointed to all"" of us ""once to die,"" and that death, to the adopted by God in Christ Jesus, is to exchange the vicissitudes of earth for the eternal and unclouded joys of heaven, it can be only for our own loss we weep when one so much loved is taken before us to the Home above. We sympathize most sincerely with the survivors in their loss; but we rejoice with the departed in that she has finished her course, and obtained the prize of her high calling in Christ Jesus.'}, {'id': 3706, 'article_title': 'DEATH', 'full_section_title': 'DEATH', 'last_edit_date': '10-17-1879', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-23', 'issue_date': '01_01_1879', 'content': '## DEATH.\n\n**Ribeiro.**—Died at Accra, on the 17th October, in his own residence, F.

Having had the honour of King Sackity\'s friendship, I wish to say that it is the invariable custom, _ab antiquo_, for all kings and chiefs in West Africa to be buried in their houses, and hasty or violent action on the part of the British Government will give great offence, and be resisted by the people in the Protectorates and ""spheres of influence."" I agree that in coast towns in the Colony the extra-mural interment law should be strictly enforced; but in the Protectorate, which extends beyond the Colony into the interior, and includes Croboe, fussy officialism is now doing harm, as the people strongly resent interference in their customs. That Commissioner Williams should have insulted the Croboes by demanding the exhumation of the King\'s body, is a most regrettable proceeding, for a riot would have certainly ensued had he insisted on his imprudent order being carried out. Full inquiry should be made into this matter, as the Croboes are allowed by the Queen to enjoy the privilege of Native courts. Strife and rebellions on the Gold Coast have generally been caused by want of tact and judgment on the part of district commissioners, who exercise wide powers as executive officers, besides sitting as magistrates with civil and criminal jurisdiction, and too frequently alienate the Natives by inconsiderate conduct and haughty bearing. There have, indeed, been some notable exceptions; but the best of the European officials seldom remain long in West African settlements. We still need the guiding hand of the Saxon, and it is the sincere desire of all the Natives that Lord Knutsford will send out wise men of temperate habits and cool judgment to carry on the administration of West Africa with firmness tempered with discretion. Under no circumstances should ""half-breeds"" be employed in responsible positions, for a negro cannot respect a man who insults his black mother and apes the position and habits of his white father, who often disowns him.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate.

Rua, a very large section of country north and west of Cazembe\'s, but still in the same inland region, is peopled by men very like those of Insama and Cazembe. An Arab, Syde Bin Habib, went to trade in Rua two years ago, and as the Arabs usually do where the natives have no guns, Syde Bin Habib\'s elder brother carried matters with a high hand. The Rua men observed that the elder brother slept in a white tent, and, pitching their spears into it by night, killed him. As Moslems never forgive bloodshed, the younger brother forthwith ran amuck on all indiscriminately in a large district. Let it not be supposed that any of these people are like the American Indians—insatiable, bloodthirsty savages, who will not be reclaimed or enter into terms of lasting friendship with fair-dealing strangers. Had the actual murderers been demanded, and a little time been granted, I feel morally certain, from many other instances among tribes who, like the Ba Rua, have not been spoiled by Arab traders, they would all have been given up. The chiefs of the country would, first of all, have specified the crime of which the elder brother was guilty, and who had been led to avenge it. It is very likely that they would stipulate that no other should be punished but the actual perpetrator. Domestic slaves acting under his orders would be considered free from blame. I know of nothing that distinguishes the uncontaminated Africans from other degraded peoples more than their entire reasonableness and good sense. It is different after they have had wives, children, and relatives kidnapped; but that is more than human nature, civilised or savage, can bear. In the case in question indiscriminate slaughter, capture, and plunder took place. A very large number of very fine young men were captured and secured in chains and wooden yokes. I came near the party of Syde Bin Habib, close to the point where a rent in the mountains of Rua allows the escape of the great river Lualaba out of Lake Moero. And here I had for the first time an opportunity of observing the difference between slaves and freemen made captives. When fairly across Lualaba Syde thought his captives safe, and got rid of the trouble of attending to and watching the chained gangs by taking off both chains and yokes. All declared their joy, and perfect willingness to follow Syde to the end of the world or elsewhere, but next morning twenty-two made clear off to the mountains. Many more, on seeing the broad Lualaba roll between them and the homes of their infancy, lost all heart, and in three days eight of them died. The had no complaint but pain in the heart, and they pointed out its seat correctly; though many believe that the heart is situated underneath the top of the sternum or breast-bone. This to me was the most startling death I ever saw. They evidently died of broken-heartedness, and the Arabs wondered, \'seeing they had plenty to eat.\' I saw the others perish, particularly a very fine boy of ten or twelve years of age. When asked if he felt ill he put his hand correctly and exactly over the heart. He was kindly carried, and as he breathed out his soul was laid gently on the side of the path. The captors were not unusually cruel. They were callous—slaving had hardened their hearts. When Syde, who was an old friend of mine, crossed the Lualaba, he heard that I was in a village where a company of slave traders had been furiously assaulted for three days by justly-incensed Babeemba. I would not fight nor allow my people to fire if I saw them, because the Babeemba had been especially kind to me. Syde sent a party of his own people to invite me to leave the village by night, and come to him. He showed himself the opposite of hard-hearted; but slaving \'hardens all within, and petrifies the feelings.\' It is hard for the victims, and for the victimisers.', 'last_edit_date': '1872-08-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_08_1872#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African Steam Navigation Company\'s steamship Gaboon brought news of a murder at Old Calabar. In spite of the efforts of the missionaries and the Consul to abolish the cruelties and barbarous practices of the natives there, there are still many of the old customs in vogue. While the Gaboon was in the river, a petty chief, named Bokko, punished one of his slaves by chaining him to a post and brutally cutting off both his ears. The unfortunate slave, after two or three days\' exposure to the sun, with nothing to eat or drink, expired, and was found dead by some of the natives, a pool of blood marking the place of his murder. Bokko was at once arrested by King Adam Archibong, and after several days\' confinement was fined sixty boxes of brass rods, a fine equal to 120£. of English money. It appeared that the man had misconducted himself with one of Bokko\'s wives. The trial created quite a sensation in Duke Town, all the Europeans being invited to attend by the King, who explained, through his interpreter, his determination to abolish the cruel practices so long the fashion there.

That the other West African Colonies, such as Lagos and the Gold Coast, are also suffering from the same cause is equally clear, and that the great and important colony of Sierra Leone feels her interests to be sadly compromised by the so-called consolidation of all the settlements into a general government, with local administrators at the Gambia, Cape Coast, and Lagos, is clearly shown by the able Editor of the West African Liberator (published at Sierra Leone) in several of his leaders, but more especially in one dated 5th September of last year, from which I extract the following paragraph. Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers."" After illustrating in his usual clear and forcibly style the manner in which Sierra Leone suffers from this great official mistake, he goes on to say: ""This interference with the other settlements is the cause of much mischief. By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

It would take a lengthened space were I to relate all the circumstances which resulted in the most brutal murder of this poor man. I shall only confine myself to what I myself saw. He was paraded round about the town, and then taken to the place of his execution, where he was placed in the middle of a large concourse of spectators, all, except the women, armed almost to the teeth, and then literally butchered.\n\nNot quite a week after this, an English vessel called the ""John Bardon,"" which was lying off here trading, was driven on shore by a violent hurricane; all efforts were made by her crew to save her, and she might have certainly been saved if assistance had been rendered to her. She made signal for a boat to come alongside to give help, but none of the savages, who were then about 300 on the beach, could be prevailed upon to do so; although many of them were good boatmen, and although large rewards were offered if they would do so. The whole crowd of the natives present, anticipating the plunder which the wreck would afford, appeared exceedingly anxious that the vessel might run ashore. They jumped for joy, invoking their Fetish to cause the vessel to wreck.

The result has been unspeakably disappointing. Leaving out of consideration the towns of Sierra Leone and Lagos, where the conditions have been abnormal, the tendency has been everywhere in the line of deterioration. There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

Though Benin had signed a treaty of protection with the British in 1892, she none the less guarded her sovereignty with determination. This, of course, would not be tolerated in that age, and using the killing of the British acting consul-general and five other Englishmen on their way to Benin as an excuse, the British launched a punitive expedition of 1500 men against Benin in 1897. Though the Oba himself would have liked to submit, a majority of his chiefs raised an army to beat back the invasion. They were, however, defeated and the capital was looted of its precious bronze treasures and then burnt. 48 In the Niger Delta, as in many other areas of Nigeria, the British had signed treaties of protection with most of the chiefs by 1884. However, while some, like Calabar and Bonny, had allowed missionaries to operate in their states, others had not. Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy.

But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

E. Betts' contribution (Chapter 13), a full-time or standing army. As has been amply demonstrated, most traditional African states south of the Sahara did not have standing armies. In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'. '$^{6}$ Indeed, as will be seen in the next volume, as a result of their repeated and often unnecessary and unjustifiable interventions in the politics of independent African states, those armies have become the heaviest of the millstones round the necks of African governments and peoples."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system. These various strategies and measures proved on the whole unsuccessful, and by the end of the period under review, colonialism had become firmly entrenched in the whole of West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Conquest and reaction in British West Africa, 1880-1900 > Asante (Gold Coast)', 'content': ""Nowhere in West Africa had there been a longer tradition of confrontation between Africans and Europeans than in the Gold Coast between the Asante and the British.

In 1850 and 1863 war was narrowly averted but between 1869 and 1872, the Asante launched a three-pronged attack which resulted in the occupation of virtually all the southern and coastal states of the Gold Coast. To beat back the Asante, the British government launched one of the best organized campaigns of the period under the command of one of the most famous British officers of the day, General Garnet Wolseley. Armed with the latest weapons, this army succeeded in pushing the Asante army across the Pra river and entered and sacked Kumasi in February 1874 after a very fierce last-ditch stand by the Asante army at Amoafo near Bekwai. 40 This decisive defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874 had very far-reaching consequences and was to influence, to a great extent, the reactions of the Asante during the period 1880-1900. The first obvious effect was the disintegration of the Asante empire. By the Treaty of Fomena, Asante recognized the independence of all the vassal states south of the Pra. Taking advantage of the weakening of the military power of Asante, the vassal states to the north of the Volta river also broke away. Even the core of the empire that remained began to break up. Anxious to see that the Asante empire was never revived, the British instigated some of the member states of the Asante Union to assert their independence, and Dwaben, Kokofu, Bekwai and Nsuta began to defy the Asantehene.$^{4}$ ' The conflict between Kumasi and Dwaben in fact led to a civil war which ended in the defeat of the former and the mass migration of the people into the recently proclaimed British Protectorate and Colony of the Gold Coast.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 474, 'article_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'full_section_title': 'NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER NIGER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-13', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': '\n\nThe above paragraph follows immediately the statement that ""promises have been made to those chiefs [in the Niger] that trading ports should be established in their territories."" To procure a continuous and dependable steam navigation on the Niger and its tributaries, with the formation of trading ports there, had therefore, to say nothing of the preceding eighteen years, been for the last six years the recognised Imperial policy. Dr. Baikie was maintained in the Niger, in furtherance of this policy, at an expense of not less than 2,000l. a-year. Several voyages of Her Majesty\'s gunboats up the river had also been made during those years. Dr. Baikie\'s reports had been published from time to time by Her Majesty\'s Government, in order to afford information and, as it was evidently hoped, inducements, to the mercantile community. But all had been in vain. Strenuous efforts were made among the African merchants in London and Liverpool to induce them to fulfil the Government desire on the basis of a subsidy. But they either scouted, or lent but an inefficient countenance to, the proposal. Individually and collectively, they would ""have none of it."" Things remained in this state till the powerful Company of African Merchants, with its fully-subscribed capital of 400,000l., came upon the scene. The opinions and views of persons hitherto not engaged in African trade, but who became shareholders of this company with the express condition that it should co-operate, if possible, with Her Majesty\'s Government for carrying forward the Imperial policy in the Niger, were now brought to bear on this question. And only thus could any body of merchants, whether as directors of a company or otherwise, have been brought to consent to take upon themselves the great labour, as well as risk, of such an enterprise. The field, as already stated, had been long open—no one stepped in to occupy it—all turned their backs on it, until the Company of African Merchants, acting under the impulse already described, agreed to enter on certain conditions, such as had been on a former occasion accepted by Her Majesty\'s Government for a very much smaller service. One department of Her Majesty\'s Government had been year after year calling out to its agents on their watch-tower, ""Sister Anne, Sister Anne, is there any one coming—any one to place steam navigation on the Niger, and to enable us to redeem those promises we have made, again and again, to the chiefs, the nonfulfilment of which dishonours and disgraces this country?"" At last the hoped-for one appears—appears, in efficient form—appears, fully capable in every way of giving the required aid. And then in step the African merchants to protest against the work being done in the only way in which it can be accomplished. They call upon the Government to stultify itself in all it has been doing for years past. They say, throw away the ten or twenty thousand pounds you have spent on Dr. Baikie and on gunboat expeditions up the river during the last six years. And why, forsooth? For this only reason, as appears by the memorials—this: we cannot and will not eat the hay ourselves, and we will not that others eat of it. This dog in the manger system is nothing new in the world. But that it should have succeeded with the department that holds the purse-strings of the Government and nation, seems to us inexplicable. But alas! such has been the fact. Instead of meeting the opponents with, ""Gentlemen, this navigation of the Niger—this trade in the Niger—has long been a cherished desire of Her Majesty\'s Government; will you undertake it as efficiently as has been proposed to us, and on better terms than have been proposed to us?"" the department says, ""We think you are right—so you will not and cannot eat hay, it would really be very hard that anybody else should be allowed to do so; it would be hard to see others feeding, and the nation rejoicing, where you cannot and will not eat.

This is our brief reply to the queries and suggestions of past and present Under-Secretaries for the Colonies in the House of Commons. It is not our business here to enter upon a consideration of the new policy of Downing-street with regard to British colonies generally, as shadowed forth in Colonial-office despatches and official and other authoritative declarations in Parliament. The policy of setting all the purely British colonies free from the mother country, and thus casting off her emigrated children in order to save the supposed burden of their protection may prevail, and Great Britain may stand out among the nations as an almost branchless trunk, hastening rapidly thereby the inevitable period of her utter prostration; but even then the West African Settlements occupy so exceptional a position in their relations with her, that they could not be included in this general policy without bringing upon her a degree of odium and judgment which no nation can afford to incur and provoke. These settlements were not founded, as Mr. Monsell asserted they were, for the purpose of suppressing the slave-trade. One—at least of them—that of Cape Coast and the Gold Coast—was founded for the express purpose of carrying on the slave-trade, in order to procure a supply of labour to the plantations in America and the sugar colonies of the Antilles; and the others for objects of Imperial policy, at periods when the new suicidal doctrine of the uselessness of colonial possessions had not become an article of political faith among any class of politics men. Up to a very late period the Government and people of Great Britain looked with a most jealous eye upon all extension of dominion by France on the West Coast of Africa, and this not because of French slave-trading proclivities, but because an increase of French establishments there was deemed to be menacing and prejudicial to British interests. The efforts to colonise Sierra Leone from Britain and Nova Scotia, and its subsequent history as the asylum for liberated slaves, are too well known to render any detail or comment necessary here. The Gambia settlement was a consequence of the restoration of Senegal to the French under the provisions of the treaty of Vienna. British merchants had established themselves in the captured French colony; under the severely exclusive French system this was no longer a place for them when it was restored; they consequently removed their establishments to the sandbank at the mouth of the Gambia, and thus Bathurst was founded. For a time they ruled themselves; but the Colonial-office stepped in and organised British colonial government in the rising settlement. The Cape and Gold Coast settlement consisted, as already stated, originally of slave factories, and only at a comparatively recent period was made accessory to the carrying out by Great Britain of her policy of repentance; while Lagos, of which we ought to know something, although ostensibly annexed for putting an end to the slave-trade in those parts, would, we believe, never have been so annexed had it not been pretty well understood, that if not made a British it would soon become a French possession. On these grounds the West Coast settlements occupy an exceptional position among the colonies of Great Britain. Again, we do not believe that any one of the colonies peopled by Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen could be subdued and subjugated by any force that it would suit the purpose and means of any foreign power to send against it; but this cannot be said of the West Coast settlements. If abandoned to themselves by Great Britain, and left without her protection, they would be immediately exposed to foreign aggression, and be compelled to admit some other sovereignty; and few things could be more disgraceful than this to Great Britain, after her having been the means of raising up an educated native class attached to English rule, if that rule be what it ought to be. Strong, however, as these reasons are against abandonment, and unanswerable as the arguments are against cession or exchange, without the full and free consent of the people interested, we should have very grave and painful doubts of their prevailing against the new doctrines now held in high places with regard to British colonial possessions, if we were not able to show that these West African settlements are at present in a position to pay all the expenses of their government and necessary protection, except so much of the latter as can be given by the British Navy without any outlay beyond what Great Britain must necessarily incur in keeping the police of the seas and protecting the commerce of London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow, &c., with the Coast of Western Africa, unless she intend to descend altogether from the position of a first-rate naval power, in which case, as Grattan most truly said, ""she will be nothing.""'}, {'id': 1964, 'article_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'full_section_title': 'GAMBIA—ITS ADMINISTRATION AND THREATENED CESSION.', 'last_edit_date': '12-12-1870', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1871#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_01_1871', 'content': ""To show what an outrageous job this providing a pension for Mr. Richard Pine is, I am bound to state that after the Colony of the Gambia was relieved of this gentleman, as was fondly imagined, by his translation to another colony and a higher office, the appointment of Queen's Advocate was filled up by bestowing it on a gentleman who was clerk in the Custom-house at the Gambia, who managed after he was appointed, by a judicious system of obtaining leave of absence as often as he could, to get called to the bar in England; and this individual has also managed after a few years' service to get a pension on the plea of ill-health of 133l. 6s. 8d. per annum, which he is now drawing from the unhappy Gambia Revenue, although he is present well enough to go to India, where he is adding to his pension by practising in that country, although his health was so ruined as to unfit him for the discharge of the duties of his sinecure on the West Coast of Africa.

The rough and ready way of dealing with temporary obstruction or ill-will on the part of the natives, by the employment of those fearful means of destruction now possessed by British ships of war, is not one that can as a general rule be commended; nor do we think it ought to be employed except under superior orders from home, except in cases where the lives and properties of British subjects are in immediate and imminent peril, from which they can only be relieved by the prompt employment of the guns of Her Majesty's ships.

For months past it has been pointed out that the French and other European nations were gradually bearing in upon the irregularly defined boundaries of our authority towards the interior; and now the constriction of the annexation band which the recent settlements of the French have completed around the eastern and northern limits of the British sphere in West Africa is beginning to be most painfully felt upon our trade and intercourse with the interior. From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia. The Governor has investigated the circumstances attending the hauling-down of the Union Jack at two stations in the interior. In one case it was found that the district was distinctly under British protection; the other was about ""forty yards outside the British limit."" Doubtless, this is a near thing; but the rule the French, with the rest of our rivals, are in the habit of applying is, that ground which cannot be proved to belong to us must belong to them.

The King of Apollonia is surprised and indignant at this proof of the value of British protection, as he naturally thought that protection has some other meaning besides the payment of Custom duties.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

On the whole, these small societies were accustomed to the diplomatic practice of switching allegiances and gravitating towards the stronger prevailing power, or of feigning non-alignment while manipulating the dominant powers to their own advantage. The Shona, Tonga, Tawara, Venda and Ndau had frequently employed these strategies throughout the eighteenth and nine› teenth centuries, during the rivalry between the Changamire and Mwenemutapa dynasties, while the Sotho, Mpondo, Mfengu, Thembu and Tonga had utilized similar strategies to exploit the rivalry between the Mtetwa and Ndwande confederacies. Thus many of these peoples readily aligned themselves with the British against the Zulu, Ndebele, Bemba, Nguni and Yao. Added to this, several of the small groups, such as the Mfengu, Thembu, Njanja, Cewa and Tawara, had for some time existed under strong military influence. As a result, they had among their people significant segments of Christianized, sometimes educated Africans, who not only rejected the traditional culture, but challenged the traditional leadership to the advantage of the colonizer.\nThus, by offering alliance, protection and/or liberation, the British were easily able to divide and conquer them. They then established permanent white settlement in these areas.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'States and peoples of the Niger Bend and the Volta', 'section_title': 'Political and institutional upheavals > Summary', 'content': 'Thus, in the centre and the north of the region covered in this chapter, existing political structures went into in a state of increasingly rapid decline in the nineteenth century and in some cases came to be dominated by new forces which had arisen mainly as a result of the Sokoto djihäd.

There is no doubt that, as a result of processes which had come into operation some time before, kingdoms and peoples that had not adopted centralized systems of govern› ment were about to reach a turning point in their history as regards both their internal affairs and the external influences to which they were subject.\nIn turn, the Mossi, Bambara and Joola kingdoms had attempted to gain control of an area including both the fringes of the desert and the edges of the forest.

To a certain extent this power vacuum reflected the past inability of many Central African societies to organize or sustain a centralized political system. Many of the Lunda and Shona states had also undergone a process of political fractionalization. North of the Zambezi, the slave trade intensified internal rivalries in the kingdoms of the Lunda of Kazembe, Undi, Kalonga and Lundu that left them vulnerable to the seditious activities and attacks of the slave traders and their Nguni counterparts. To the south, cleavages within the Shona aristocracy, coupled with the devastating raids of the Zwangendaba and Gaza Nguni, substantially weakened the regional powers. The incursions of Zwangendaba, for example, are generally credited with destroying the badly divided Rozwi kingdom of Changamire, while the division of the Barue state into two competing factions, coupled with the debilitating Gaza raids, enabled the Goan adventurer Gouveia to usurp temporarily the Barue throne around 1875. 97 Gouveia's success was part of a larger process by which Yao, ArabSwahili, Chikunda and Nguni invaders took advantage of the power vacuum to impose conquest states. While these new military states were undoubt› edly stronger than the polities they had vanquished, the subject peoples often perceived them as alien interlopers and resented their authoritarian rule. As a result, the leaders were compelled to intensify their coercive practices, which heightened the level of hostility and increased the fre› quency of insurrections. The revolts of the lakeside Tonga, Tumbuka and Henga against the Mbwela Nguni, and of the Tonga and Chopi against the Gaza, demonstrate the growing antipathy of the oppressed. A similar spirit of defiance motivated the Tawara and Tonga to periodically challenge the Afro-Portuguese and their Chikunda allies, who had carved out large territorial holdings along the southern margin of the Zambezi. The Swahili ruler, who governed the coastal sultanates of Angoche and Quitanghona, faced similar opposition. Such animosity did not lend itself to a unified struggle against the Europeans. On the contrary, many of the subject peoples subsequently refused to assist the alien rulers; others actually aided the Europeans whom they perceived as 'liberators'. 98 The dependence of the slave-trading"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'The chiefdoms and the fragmentation of power', 'content': 'Despite the far-reaching social changes in the Lunda-Chokwe region in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Lunda aristocracy did not die out completely.

The dominant cultural group on the plateau, broadly termed the Nyanyeka-Nkhumbi, consisted of several ethnic groups: Nyanyeka, Otyilenge, Nkhumbi, etc. In the nineteenth century, some of the chiefdoms in the region were, in fact, the remains of former kingdoms. One such was Mwila, a Nyanyeka kingdom, which dominated the entire Huila region in the eighteenth century and broke up towards the middle of the nineteenth century with the succession of Jau, which soon disintegrated in its turn. In the eighteenth century Mwila had entered into contact with Caconda and Portuguese Angola.

The Nyanyeka chief› doms, especially Mwila, and later Ngambwe, became trading centres for wax, ivory and livestock, supplying the whole of southern Angola in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although trade itself contributed to the political break-up of the region, raids and plundering expeditions often favoured the swift rise to power of adventurers or newcomers.

There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

Due to a by no means unusual time-lag, European decisions to abolish the slave trade did not prevent it from reaching a paroxysm in the course of the nineteenth century in a number of countries on the Niger Bend and in the upper basin of the various affluents of the Volta. Emancipation by the state and reintegration into lineage groups did little to reduce the destructive effects of this scourge, which was not to abate until the end of the nineteenth century.

Before these wars a large quantity of ivory and gold formed part of the trade in this island, but now they are not to be seen; and although there is a sort of peace made between the two tribes, yet still they are not on visiting terms, and marks of deadly hatred are sometimes manifested which will sooner or later break out into open war; in fact, both parties are now only afraid of our Government, as the Governor has made them to understand that the first party who takes up arms will have the British to contend with as well as his native enemies.*\n\nYou will hear from me again about these tribes.""}, {'id': 830, 'article_title': 'Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '04-10-1866', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1866#article-17', 'issue_date': '23_05_1866', 'content': ""Sir,—I cannot conceal from you my apprehensions that the new system of government policy for the Protected Territories will prove to be an impracticable one.

That dispute of the Addahs and Awoonahs on the Volta ought to have been promptly dealt with a year ago. It would then probably have caused but very little expense and trouble, and trade would now have been prospering again.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that as long as the outlying tribes are left to themselves, and not duly subjected to British jurisdiction, there can be no permanent peace and well-doing in the protectorate. The idea that the new policy of the Government will prove to be economical is altogether unsound. If they (the British Government) wish to shake off the protectorate, and bring about an early and entire abandonment thereof, the present plans may be suitable ones, overlooking, of course, the question of political and Christian morality; but if they really wish to train the tribes to become a successful self-government, they must adopt a policy widely different from that on which they are now acting.\n\nAs you will, no doubt, hear direct from the camp on the Volta, I shall not give you any of the rumours about military affairs there.\n\nPoor Colonel Conran has lost his wife, who died while on her voyage here from Liverpool.

But Master Baccary—oh! I beg his pardon—King Baccary Sardah has not as yet seen the ends of the outrage that he had committed, and although the British Government is not likely to undertake an expedition against a sovereign who had committed such depredation against British property beyond British territory, yet still there is a power near at hand who stands no humbug, and whose word carries terror amongst all the Mohammedan chieftains here, and commands respect. An appeal was made by the Governor of the Gambia to the Governor of Senegal, as our hero was an ally of the French. He immediately, with that promptitude which always characterises the French in their dealings with the warlike native tribes here, sent a letter, in good Arabic, to Baccary, telling him, in plain language, that he was a fool for going and fighting with his own family; that he heard with concern that Baccary had destroyed English property; that he was to remember that Englishmen and Frenchmen were brethren; and that if he did not make restitution for what he had destroyed, he must look out for a joint expedition against him. This is strong language, but it comes from a man who is capable of suiting his actions to his words. Governor La Prat, within four weeks, could have several thousand men in the field, ready to pursue Baccary. How far the administration of the Gambia can do that, past history does not warrant us to say. La Prat has commanded Baccary to return home and attend to his domestic improvements. I believe that this will meet with strict obedience from him; but whether we have to get the French to fight for us, or whether our Government will demand, even with the sword, the payment of our property destroyed by Baccary\'s army, is a question as yet to be solved.

He detained all the British traders within the kingdom of Badiboo, with their goods and chattels, not allowing one man to leave the place, and also prevented all ingress into Badiboo, thus putting a stop to the trade of an extensive country, whose yearly quota of ground-nuts and hides adds greatly to the revenue of the colony.

He at once sent to Colonel D'Arcy that, unless the woman and children were delivered up, all friendly diplomatic relation must stop, and trade cease, and the ports of Badiboo must, consequently, be considered closed to English merchants.\n\nBut the real cause, to all those who have studied the character of these Marabouts, inhabitants of the River Gambia, is to be found in that ambitious, overbearing, and covetous disposition of the Mussulmans, who view with discontent the rich prize they would obtain, could they have an opportunity of making one midnight raid on the rich Babboo Christian merchants at Bathurst. The toleration of this overbearing disposition of the Marabout chieftains in the River Gambia will always lead to serious complications; they must be made to understand that the British Government, although desirous of peace, yet still will never tolerate any nonsense from them.\n\nWe have not as yet forgotten the outrageous attack of Mahfal, the Commander-in-Chief of south-eastern Badiboo, on towns in British grounds, which led to the battle of Zoobabocolong; and at present, if reports from traders are correct, the greater part of Mahba's force is threatening Albreda.

Convinced of the hopelessness of expecting that peace could be maintained so long as the Fantees and other tribes remained subject to the exactions and oppressions of their former rulers, and yet foreseeing at the same time the dangers which must result if so large a body of natives, composed of different tribes, and having different interests and views, were left to carry on their affairs without the control or guidance of any superior power, believing moreover that the influence of such a superior and civilised power would help to work valuable reforms among the most turbulent and lawless of them, he conceived the idea of compelling from the King of Ashantee an acknowledgment of their independence, and by the influence over them which our interference on their behalf had obtained for us, of inducing them to band themselves together under our guidance and control for protection against the common enemy. These important objects were at length secured by the signing of a treaty, on the 27th April, 1831, between the Governor, the Ashantees, and the Fantee and other tribes then in alliance with us, and during the next twelve years the results of this arrangement under the administration of Governor Maclean are detailed in the report of the committee of 1842, ""there was exercised a very wholesome influence over a coast not much less than 150 miles in extent, and to a considerable distance inland, preventing within that range external slave trade, maintaining peace and security, and exercising a useful, though irregular, jurisdiction among the neighbouring tribes, and much mitigating, and in some cases extinguishing some of the most atrocious practices which had prevailed among them unchecked before.""\n\nIn consequence of the recommendation of this committee, the direct management of the Gold Coast Settlements was in 1844 resumed by the Imperial Government, and at first placed under the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone; but in 1850 it was by letters patent created into a separate Government with executive and legislative councils for the administration of its affairs, an arrangement which continues at the present time.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1865#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Political Troubles on the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The British and African steamer Opobo, with mails and passengers from the West Coast of Africa, arrived at Liverpool a short time since.

The trouble occurred at Opobo, near Bonny river, and, notwithstanding the presence in the river of H.M.S. Bramble since September last, the chiefs have thrown a boom across the river to oppose the passage of steamboats belonging to the traders. The cause of their defiant action is easily understood. They occupy a commanding position in the river, and being possessed of thousands of men and arms to man their canoes, they are a dangerous enemy. Originally the traders purchased the produce of the interior entirely from them, but of late years have sent their steamboats higher up the river to buy at first cost.

Being unable to get the rubber the Natives were punished, with the result that about sixty stations rose simultaneously and attacked the various posts, and took the guns and ammunition from the State soldiers. A large number of these were massacred, and a general advance was made upon Basoko, the principal station. Three separate attacks were made upon the place, which was strongly garrisoned under seven or eight State officers, and surrounded by a palisade.

This trade especially concerned Manchester and the district around, because the bulk of the goods that went to the West Coast were cotton goods.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there.

Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'. France, he continued, was guaranteeing 'the economic growth and human development' of its colonies. 2"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Only few of the colonial administrators seemed to have understood how to manage the uneasy relationship which existed between the 'traditional' and the new African elites on the one hand, and between these two sets of elites and the colonial regimes on the other.

Even for these, the general strategy consisted in dampening the aspirations of the new educated elite who were usually portrayed as ambitious upstarts. It was generally convenient to cultivate a conflict situation in relations between the two sets of African leadership elites, with the imperial master acting as the protector of 'traditional' leadership and systems of government. In such a situation neither set of elites was satisfied with the colonial regimes. In 1917, Governor-General Joost Van Vollenhoven highlighted the potentially explosive nature of the problem, especially in relation to the future of colonialism, in the following perceptive piece: The indigenous chiefs, those of yesterday whom we have preserved, or those of today whom we have created, complain of being humiliated. The 'interpreters', the various types of auxiliaries of the administration and of commerce, complain that they are 'instruments' and do not have the rank due to them as collaborators.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the political field', 'content': ""Another important but negative political impact of colonialism was the weakening of the indigenous systems of government. In the first place, as S. Abubakar has recently pointed out and as is evident from many of the chapters above, most of the African states were acquired as a result of the conquest and deposition or exile of the then rulers which 'certainly brought into disrepute the whole business of chieftaincy, especially during the period before the First World War'.$^{13}$ Some of the colonial powers, such as the French as we have seen already, also abolished some of the traditional monarchies and ruling families altogether, appointed people as chiefs who had no right to such posts and turned all of them into admini› strative officers. The British and the Belgians retained the traditional rulers and their institutions and even, as R. F. Betts has shown (Chapter 13), created some where they did not exist and tried to administer the colonies through them. However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment. Besides, the colonial system of administering justice in which subjects could appeal to the colonial courts further weakened not only the authority but also the financial resources of the traditional rulers. $^{1 s}$ Furthermore, the spread of the Christian religion undermined the spiritual basis of the authority of the kings. In all these ways, then, the colonial system, in accordance with its own interests, at times weakened or even destroyed the traditional rulers and at times allied with them and used them.

The first of these is the fact that some of these boundaries cut across pre-existing ethnic groups, states and kingdoms and this has caused widespread social disruption and displace› ment. The Bakongo are, for instance, found divided by the boundaries of Angola, Belgian Congo (now Zaire), French Congo (now Congo) and Gabon. Today, some of the Ewe live in Ghana, some in Togo and some in Benin; the Somali are shared among Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti; the Senufo are found in Mali, Ivory Coast and Upper Volta.

One important consequence of this situation has been the chronic border disputes that have plagued the relations between some independent African states - such as those between Sudan and Uganda; between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Kenya and Somalia; between Ghana and Togo; and between Nigeria and Cameroon.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Although the treaty of 1833 between Nicolls and King William was rejected, British agents concluded treaties between 1840 and 1844 that provided them with the legal basis for intervention in local politics. Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey. But the more frequent excuse for British intervention arose from the disputes between European and local traders over the repayment of credit or 'trust'. In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Purposes and impositions of colonialism', 'content': ""Within this general pattern there were many regional distinctions, the most prominent being that connected with Lugard's idea of 'native authority'. As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

And is it such a reply as British subjects are entitled to expect, when they have been told on the authority of persons who are said to be in the confidence of the Colonial-office, that they are about to be transferred nolens volens to a foreign power; so that they must henceforth carry on their trade in a foreign settlement, instead of in a British possession and under British laws; or wind up their affairs there at perhaps a ruinous sacrifice? We do not think that any man out of the Colonial-office would say that it is. Mr. Quin and the other Gambia merchants know, no doubt, as well as Earl Granville does, that African settlements are so little cared for in the British Parliament, that when once matters have gone so far as regards one of them as that a convention for its cession to France shall have been signed by a Government possessed of an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons, there would be but little chance of Parliament disallowing the Royal action in the matter. They, therefore, naturally, and very properly, desired to know whether such a convention had been agreed upon, in order that they might have time to express their views respecting it before, by its signature, it became virtually'}, {'id': 1848, 'article_title': 'The Manchester Chamber of Commerce', 'full_section_title': 'The Manchester Chamber of Commerce', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1870#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_07_1870', 'content': 'station at the mouth of the Gambia was only 200 miles from the French station at the Senegal, while it was 500 miles away from our next nearest station, Sierra Leone, and it was proposed that the French should give us an undisputed right to several stations nearer to Sierra Leone about which there was some dispute at present, and that we in exchange should give them the Gambia station.

The question of Ebute Meta, Palma, and Leckie (places not at all belonging to the British Government), are in the way. Lagos, as I believe you are aware, is an island; and before its cession to the British Crown, Ebute Meta, &c., never paid tribute to Akitoye, the then King of Lagos; and after its cession, these places never entered into any treaty with the British Government. How is it, then, that the British Government has claimed them? Ebute Meta, Ogb, Agege, &c., formerly belonged to Ottas. The Egbas subsequently waged war with the Ottas, and conquered them. Does it not necessarily follow that those places which were subject to Otta, legally became so to the Egbas by right of conquest? The Lagos Government feels it hard to give up Ebute Meta and the other places. Why? Simply because lots of fine houses have been built there by Governor Glover, and nothing more. Governor Hennessy has withdrawn the constables stationed at Ogb, Agege, &c., and I believe, if the deputation had informed him fairly of Ebute Meta not belonging to the British Government, he would also have withdrawn the constables from that place, and the roads would have been opened long ago. It is to be deplored he did not give more time to these important matters. I am writing you the true sentiments in the minds of the Egbas. I know their grievances. The merchants of Lagos derive no commercial benefit from Ebute Meta.

They further say that they ""still view the proposed cession with great alarm, and naturally feel a great aversion to being summarily transferred to a foreign Power whose language, habits, and institutions are diametrically opposed to their own, and whose policy, as evidenced at Senegal and Goree, they feel sure will materially interfere with their social and religious rights;"" that they are ""opposed to the transfer because they are averse to French rule—because, as loyal subjects of the Queen, they are attached to British institutions—because they love political and religious liberty—because by their efforts they have acquired property in the settlements which the projected transfer would materially affect,"" and because it would be ""fraught with such evil consequences to themselves and to their children."" These are strong and just grounds of opposition to the proposed cession. The British merchants at the Gambia, whose case we considered in our last, have only pecuniary interests at stake, and such as Her Majesty\'s Government may easily place beyond jeopardy, as we then pointed out; but here is something far more precious and sacred than mere pecuniary interests, and not so easy to deal with feelingly, justly, and satisfactorily. Hearts and consciences, social and religious liberty, cannot be dealt with so easily as mere pecuniary interests. These have claims that it is far more difficult to satisfy, and which a powerful and Christian Government should be the last to ignore. The petition from which we have quoted opens a view of the transfer in question differing distinctly from those we have hitherto considered, and by its very nature makes it incumbent on Her Majesty\'s Government to establish preliminarily, beyond the possibility of dispute, that the proposed cession or transfer is absolutely indispensable and necessary for Imperial as well as for general West African interests. Nothing short of this will meet the exigencies of the case. It is quite true that the British law now allows a subject to withdraw from his allegiance and place himself within another nationality if circumstances or his personal interests determine him to do so; but we do not see it at all follows that it should therefore justify the State in cancelling the birthright of any of its subjects, against the will and regardless of the protests of such subjects. We would advise the petitioners distinctly to open this question by petition to both Houses of the Imperial Legislature—to the House of Lords and to the House of Commons. It is one of the most grave importance; and, as there will not now be any transfer until the matter has been brought before Parliament by Her Majesty\'s Government, the native British subjects at the Gambia have ample time in which to prepare and forward such petitions to England. But not a moment should be lost. The Parliament will meet for dispatch of business early in the month of February next; and if, as is most probable, mention be made in Her Majesty\'s Speech of the negotiations with the French Government, and the possibility of such a treaty for transfer of settlements and possessions being entered into, the subject may come under discussion at the end of February or early in March. One object at least, if no other, will, we feel certain, be gained by our friends at the Gambia pursuing this course. If Her Majesty\'s Government cannot establish to the satisfaction of both Houses of Parliament that the proposed transfer is absolutely indispensable for the public interests, the negotiations will be put an end to; while, if they should establish in the conviction of both Houses the indispensable necessity of the transfer, there cannot fail to be an insistence by them that in any treaty with that object some means should be found for effectually guaranteeing to the native British subjects at the Gambia the full continuance and enjoyment of their rights as British subjects, and ample security of their pecuniary interests, as well as of those of the European British subjects engaged in commerce there. It is greatly to the credit of Her Majesty\'s Government that they have placed the matter in abeyance until both Houses of Parliament shall have deliberately given their opinion thereon; and we shall endeavour in future numbers of this Journal so to place the pros and cons before our readers that it may be thoroughly ventilated. It must not be a hole-and-corner affair. If there is to be a sacrifice of the feelings of African British subjects to Imperial considerations, the reasons why must appear on the public record. A constitutional Government offers this security at least to its subjects in every part of the world: one of its fundamental principles is light for the governed.

This is very encouraging to the friends of Peace, after their efforts in this direction, and after their recent Address to Lord Salisbury, in reference to the Portuguese dispute in particular. Another instructive incident was the speech of Sir Wm. Vernon Harcourt, M.P., at Derby lately, in which he pointed out that the ""spirited foreign policy,"" which, both under the Liberal Administration of Lord Palmerston and the Tory régime of Lord Beaconsfield, proved so disastrous for Great Britain, has been perseveringly guarded against by the present Government. On this point, Sir Wm. Harcourt remarked: ""If we have been able to approve the foreign policy of Lord Salisbury, it is because it is the exact opposite of the policy of Lord Beaconsfield in 1878; it is because the present policy of Lord Salisbury has dealt a fatal blow to what used to be called a \'spirited foreign policy.\' To my mind, the surrender of Heligoland was a far more sensible proceeding than the acquisition of Cyprus. Cyprus was going to be a jewel of the English Crown. What is it? A squalid possession, where, with difficulty, we wring from the people a tribute to the Turk, and cannot make it up without a supplementary grant from the English Exchequer. We have heard a great deal of nonsense on the part of the Press about a foreign Empire which was to extend from the Cape, I think, to Cairo. That is not the ideal of Lord Salisbury on that subject at all. In speaking of the arrangement that he has recently made with Germany, the Anglo-German Agreement, he said: \'If you think that we have given up ourselves somewhat too zealously to the partition and distribution of territories which did not exactly belong to us, and which it will be sometime before any of our authorities have the slightest chance of visiting, you must read between the lines, that we have by this means been evading a cause of quarrel between the nations of Europe and contributing our quota to the glorious cause of peace.\'"" This fair acknowledgment on the part of Sir Wm. Harcourt was a timely one. For only a few days previously, a London Liberal newspaper, the Echo, had stated, in an able editorial: ""We do not know of a single Radical member of the House of Commons who professes to be an intense lover of peace, who is prepared to give Lord Salisbury a word of praise for the memorable part he has played in the maintenance of peace.

The entire trade of the Colony depended on the route through Jebu territory, Lagos having natural advantages for trade development owing to its situation at the mouth of the waterway communication with the sea, which tapped some 20,000 square miles. Action on the part of any of the tribes to block the way affected the whole of the different authorities, as they were dependent on one another for the maintenance of private treaties affecting their slaves. Internal feuds might exist on matters affecting the people themselves, but within seventy or eighty miles of the coast any disturbance was apt to block the transit of goods, and trade became paralysed. Great Britain having defined, along with France, a boundary between Dahomey and Yorubaland, and having assumed the latter country as a sphere of influence, had responsibilities which she could not disregard, and the promotion of commerce, of missionary enterprise, and the well-being of the people demanded her attention. It was essential that there should be free communication with the interior, and that the Yorubas should not be prevented from bringing their produce to the coast. The authorities of Jebu had taken an antagonistic attitude to the Government of Lagos on account of its remonstrance for blocking the routes. A visit of the acting governor was treated with disdain. Subsequently an apology was demanded, failing which steps to compel obedience would be taken. On Jan. 21, Jebu messengers visited Lagos and made apologies for insults given to the acting governor, and afterwards a treaty was entered into. Following this the Egba authorities at Abeokuta closed their roads, and the letter containing the remonstrance was returned unopened. The Jebu authorities had intimated that the agreement was made without authority, and the result was that the whole trade was blocked on every side. They were of opinion that Clause 2 of the Jebu agreement was the cause of this combined action of the authorities of Abeokuta and Jebu. The Jebus in the past had put Abeokuta under obligations to them for returning the slaves passing from Yorubaland to the free soil of the British Colony, and the Jebus had had large payments for these services, which, together with the taxes on merchandise passing through, brought a larger revenue than the £500 provided for in the agreement now repudiated. And the authorities of Abeokuta professed to be aggrieved at the British having taken over the protection of the kingdom of Ilaro, bordering on Dahomeyland. Ilaro was conquered by the Egbas fifty years ago, and paid tribute to them until some few years ago. Abeokuta, being unable to give protection to Ilaro against Dahomeyan raids, Ilaro made a claim to independence, and sought to place itself under British protection. This was done by proclamation on Aug. 13, 1891, and following the decision of the Brussels Conference Ilaro would be included in the Protectorate. The authorities of Abeokuta subsequently recognised the right of Ilaro to protection from the Lagos Government. The time has come when the Government must take steps as would ensure freedom of passage to everyone, and having made arrangements to see that they were carried out. They asked this not only on commercial but humanitarian grounds. They believed that a display of force would bring about all that was wanted, and while so much activity was being displayed elsewhere in Africa it was not inappropriate that the present position should be taken advantage of to put an end to those interior difficulties which caused stoppage of trade and widespread misery to the population of Yorubaland.'}, {'id': 6602, 'article_title': 'Liverpool and the African Trade', 'full_section_title': 'Liverpool and the African Trade', 'last_edit_date': '07-04-1895', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1895#article-7', 'issue_date': '01_08_1895', 'content': 'A meeting of the Committee of the African Trade Section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce was held on July 4, Mr. Ellis Edwards in the chair.\n\nAFFAIRS OF THE NIGER.\n\nThe attention of the Foreign Office had been drawn to the movements of the Germans in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast, and of the French in the regions of the Upper Niger, and within the British sphere of influence.

With regard to Accra, it has been decided to try sinking an artesian well.

The wishes and preferences of people anxious to become loyal subjects of the Crown appear to us to deserve favourable consideration.\n\nPerhaps, however, the weightiest argument against assigning the custody of this district to a chartered company is in the fact that, besides the English trade with its inhabitants, important commercial relations exist and are likely to be extended between them and the subjects of several other Powers.

The difficulties that have in this case arisen will, it is to be hoped, be easily overcome. But we would point out to your Lordship that, while it is only by an unlooked-for accident that the Royal Niger Company has been brought into collision with Germany, and nearly all its dealings are with natives of the African interior, the occupants and owners of the Oil Rivers District are already in contact with several European nationalities. It is to the interest of all parties that this contact should be preserved and increased in legitimate ways. But, especially if the district is in the hands of a chartered company practically endowed with a monopoly, the contact must inevitably cause frequent complications which imperial authority is alone competent to adjust.

The “colonial group” alone held a meeting. The deputies belonging to that group represent every shade of political opinion, and the meeting made an energetic protest against the agreement. The Radical and Socialist papers are indifferent to all colonial questions, and did not take the trouble to explain to their readers the Anglo-Belgian agreement. But they saw in it an opportunity of renewing the charge of incapacity they are continually putting forward against a moderate Cabinet. “This Anglo-Belgian agreement,” says the République Française, “is the most audacious defiance ever offered to international law.” The Autorité declares that the agreement “gravely compromises our situation in Africa.” The Moniteur saw in it “a ray of light revealing the downfall of French prestige,” and used this pretext for an onset on all Republican Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The Matin concluded by a bitter criticism of the administration of the colonies. It is in the Débats and the Temps that we look for a serious discussion of the questions raised by the agreement. The first of these papers acknowledges the right every Power possesses of seeking to satisfy its own interests by every allowable means. According to that organ the French ought to blame themselves before throwing a stone at any other Power. The Temps holds that France could not outbid England by stipulations detrimental to Turkish and Egyptian interests, that such a course would be contrary to the traditions of French politics and would greatly embarrass the action of French diplomatists. Both papers resented the “grant or lease” of certain territories to King Leopold for his lifetime, or to the Congo Free State as long as it remains a dependency of Belgium. They observed that “England grants that which in no wise belongs to her and which in part, at least, belongs to Turkey and Egypt.” They accused her of pursuing, in an underhand way, the conquest of the Egyptian Soudan, which she would not undertake openly, as the jealousies of European Powers are more likely to be alarmed by what takes place at Cairo than by the advance of British forces in the depths of Africa. Another delicate point in the agreement was pointed out by both the Temps and Débats. It is the grant made to England by the Congo State of a strip of territory to bind together her southern and northern possessions. This arrangement is incompatible with the right of pre-emption which France has. The Débats article concluded in the following terms: “This activity, energy, perseverance, is directed against the rights of Turkey and Egypt as well as our prime interests. French interests also are threatened on the Niger, in Siam, in Southern Algeria, and nearly everywhere by English colonial policy. If the Foreign Office wants to prevent so general an opposition from becoming acute it will aim at such an arrangement as may put an end to so dangerous an antagonism, and afford a gratification to the reasonable ambitions of both great nations, whose enormous colonial territories are indeed sufficient.”', 'last_edit_date': '1894-07-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_07_1894#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE EFFECT', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'THE EFFECT of the lately popular laissez-faire policy of the Government with regard to the British colonies and settlements in West Africa is beginning to make itself most unpleasantly realised.

From Sierra Leone we have complaints that by the appropriation of the hinterlands British authority is confined to a narrow strip of coast; that French authority compels tribes outside our control to boycott our markets and to favour those of France. One effect is that natives are moving inside the British lines. The aggression assumes a most active form on the borders of our old colony on the Gambia.

By the acquisition which was forced upon us in 1853 of the native territory south of the Island of St. Mary, known as British Combo, and which has since been settled by military pensioners and captured Africans, we have interposed a barrier between the colony and a warlike and troublesome race, and have thus not only diminished the chances of future collisions, but have done much to ensure the peaceful cultivation of a large and valuable tract of country. On the northern side of the river, although we have long been the nominal possessors of a considerable portion of the Barra country, we have never ventured to exercise over it the slightest jurisdiction, and it has now been largely built on by the Marabouts, fanatics with whom it would be impossible to interfere; all thought of obtaining any influence over a country which they inhabit must therefore be abandoned. There is, however, one Sonninkee town, Essow, situated within the ceded mile of Barra, and just opposite St. Mary's Island, which, at the intercession of Governor d'Arcy, was spared by Maba when he burnt all the Pagan towns in the neighbourhood. Conscious of their weakness, the chiefs and people have expressed to the Governor a desire to live under British rule, the simplest mode of effecting which would be by the cession of their country, but this is impracticable, from the fact that they are shareholders. There are also strong objections to their country being made a protectorate, in the sense in which this word is understood in England. It would, however, be a subject of much regret if this small, harmless, and useful community should thus be abandoned to destruction through the fear of our becoming involved in unnecessary responsibilities, and it is to be hoped that the local Government may, without risk to itself, find some means of extending to them the protection they seek.

The countries on the sea-coast are divided into districts, to each of which a Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. The interior countries, however, are not thus provided for, but are left to be ruled by their chiefs and kings, as formerly. The authority of these kings and chiefs was not formally acknowledged, and any offence which, according to custom, is visited with severe punishment, is immediately reported to the Government authorities on the sea-coast; and the chieftain or king who ordered the punishment is brought before the Court and treated as the commonest fellow.\n\nThis action on the part of the Government terrifies and paralyzes a good many of these chiefs and kings, so that in a great many instances the wicked go unpunished. On the other hand, others use the name of the Government to acquire territories which they have not the least right to. Amongst these I may mention the name of one ""Sakiaty,"" who is of great notoriety in Eastern Croboe, interior of Accra. This man was a chief of Odumase, a country of Eastern Croboe, before the Ashanti Campaign, but immediately after the war, he assumed the authority and title of king, which he said was vested in him by Sir John Glover for the valuable services he rendered in the war.

This will undoubtedly end in strife, when people will have the mortification again to see that their royalties are treated contemptuously by those who are their protectors. If the present system of government in the interior countries is to continue, I would, Sir, respectfully recommend that the following plans be carried out: (1) that every chieftain or king in the interior should prove his claim; (2) that the right of government by native chiefs and kings in the interior, so far as it is compatible with common sense and humanity, be proclaimed as supported by the British authorities on the sea-coast; and (3), that any unnecessary interference and aggression of one chief or king with another, be met with the highest displeasure of the Governor.', 'last_edit_date': '1880-06-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_08_1880#article-4', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Probably it will be said that this picture is grossly exaggerated—a mere caricature.* But the fact remains that it is an Englishman who speaks, and thereby condemns his own country for the century of misrule under which Sierra Leone groans.

Speaking of the consolidation he says: ""But this having been put into practice has turned out a complete and disastrous failure, and, instead of proving a benefit to, has only brought suffering on them all (i.e., in all the settlements on the West Coast), in consequence of the evils which spring from having two masters to rule in each, minus Sierra Leone, and she, sad to say, has turned out, as usual, to be the greatest of the sufferers.""

By it the various administrators have lost their patronage, and with it their influence. It is out of their power to reward men of merit in their own governments, but they must submit to any appointments made by Sierra Leone, which has aroused great dissatisfaction, as complaints from the Gambia show. The governor-in-chief has as much as he can attend to at his own station if he were ever so industrious, and to divide his time is to make him perform his work imperfectly and unsatisfactorily. The evil can only be got rid of by placing the settlements as they were before, by confining each governor to his immediate governments, thereby preventing the one from meddling with the business of the other. Under such an arrangement individual responsibility would be felt, but under the present system no one holds himself responsible, so that should any difficulty arise we may rest assured that each will try to throw the burden on the shoulders of the others. Then, again, a fearful expense is entailed, for, among other things, a steamer must be supported to keep up a ruinous system. So much for having two rulers. It is true there are governors-in-chiefs in the West Indies as well as in the West Coast, but it must be borne in mind that these West India Islands have their own representative institutions to protect their internal affairs. They have self-government, and all the governor-in-chief has to do is to supervise.

On the east we are similarly threatened by the Germans. They started with the possession of a small station at Beh, the people of which had long been desirous of entering the protectorate, but their offers were refused by the Government. This year a Commissioner was appointed to define the frontier. A line was decided on extending due north from the coast for a distance of over three miles into the interior. On this decision the Germans immediately annexed the Krepe country as far as the banks of the Volta. The Krepes were formerly in the Danish protectorate when we acquired Quittah and all the Danish possessions. Krepe went with the rest, yet we have allowed the Germans to annex the place. The sympathies of the natives are solely with the British. These German annexations are made by the advice and on the surveys of the Basle missionaries, who have for years been subsidised and protected by the British Government. For the rescue of some of their mission the Ashantee war was undertaken. The importance of these annexations will be seen when one has a knowledge of the trade routes to the interior, as it is upon the trade with the interior that the colony depends. There are three routes. The western is up the Tando River. A very large trade is carried on here, Ashanti being mainly supplied by this route. The command of the River Tando is lost if we permit the French to dispossess us of part of Apollonia and Aowin. The central route is via Cape Coast to Prahsu and Coomassie. A small trade is done here, owing to all the carriage being by land. This route is in British hands so far. The eastern, which will be the more important route, as by it most of the Mussulman trade is carried on, passes by the Volta through Krepe. Unless the Germans are dispossessed of this country, no British trade will be done this way. I hope you will call the attention of your Society to the neglect of British interests by the Government, and to the need for instant action, or else the whole of the British trade in these parts will fall into the hands of other European Powers.

Moreover, all of them were insisting on their sovereign rights to regulate trade and to levy duties on British traders. This, the new British consuls, such as Hewett and Johnston, would not tolerate. A typical example of the rulers who stood up to the British consuls and missionaries was Jaja of Opobo (see Plate 6.3). He insisted on payment of duties by British traders and ordered a complete stoppage of trade in the river until one British firm agreed to pay duties. The consul, Johnston, ordered him to stop levying duties on English traders. But instead of doing so, Jaja dispatched a mission to the Foreign Office to protest against the order. When Jaja still refused to comply in spite of Johnston's threats to bombard his town with British gunboats, Johnston enticed Jaja on board a ship in 1887 under a promise of safeconduct but arrested him and sent him to Accra$^{49}$ where he was tried and deported to the West Indies.

For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims. As a result, closely related and sometimes previously politically united peoples at times found themselves on opposite sides of the agreed boundary lines.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.642, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': 'In the light of these considerations, no colonial power immediately sought to dispose completely of the socio-political structures already in place.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces.

This involvement of both Britain and France in the trade and politics of Lagos and Porto Novo respectively sparked off a spell of dramatic rivalry between the two powers in a bid to control Yorubaland, especially the western parts, and the adjacent Aja-speaking communities.

The issue of paper currency and shortage of silver did not improve matters either, and the European merchants were accused of hoarding the currency notes and charging high prices. According to one Gold Coast newspaper, 'The kings, chiefs, and all classes will soon be paupers' unless West Africans got together to protect themselves against the wily manoeuvres of combine magnates. In general, then, all these economic hardships led the West African press to advocate the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), and the abolition of the Crown Colony system of administration to enable Africans to have more say in the running of the economy and more representation in the administrative and legislative bodies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': ""If the more abiding claims of ethnic integrity were not always respected, neither were the more ephemeral claims of conquest states and empires to territorial integrity.

The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Marketing', 'content': ""Occasionally African producers defended their interests collectively through hold-ups (refusals to deliver produce to market).

This deputation was well received, and returned safely to Lagos, with the intention of proceeding to Ibadan, to endeavour to effect peace. Our executive would not cooperate with us, and not satisfied with discouraging us, but we were told for the first time, that the deputation had been presented with two slaves, which were not reported, inferring thereby that we were engaged in the slave-trade.

But in the interests of African civilization, of the African people, of legitimate commerce, and therefore of Lagos itself, this sort of indulgence cannot be indefinitely extended. We have given the local government carte blanche for a long period—perhaps for too long a one. The late ordinance issued there makes us feel very strongly that this is the case. It is about the first time in the history and career of our colonies that we have heard, or read, or known of the fact of being a British subject constituting a disqualification for carrying on trade beyond the limits of the colony.

The importance of Abeokuta as regards the spread of civilization, if in constant friendly alliance with Lagos and in peaceful relations with its African neighbours, is indisputable; and we cannot approve (leaving the past, reopened by the letters we have inserted, for the present unjudged) of any measures that tend to prolong the epoch of alienation after the Abeokuta authorities have made—as it seems to us that they have made—every reasonable concession to Lagos demands.'}, {'id': 763, 'article_title': 'LAGOS, ABEOKUTA, AND IBADAN.', 'full_section_title': 'LAGOS, ABEOKUTA, AND IBADAN.', 'last_edit_date': '12-23-1865', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-20', 'issue_date': '23_12_1865', 'content': 'Our hopes have not been realized, and a policy has been pursued at Lagos from which we feel bound to dissent.

Public wells are better arranged; they have roofs over them, and are furnished with implements to facilitate the drawing of water. All this is to his praise.

When are the reasonable hopes of the merchant and trader, based on an estimate of human wants and desires, to be fulfilled? Alas! we know not. Had the British policy at Lagos been a reasonable one, the native people around would have been encouraged, long ere this, to appoint someone to represent them in England—to make known their complaints and desires, and to seek satisfaction for them—instead of resorting to the barbarous system of cutting off communications, and annihilating trade, to the loss and inconvenience of their own people, as well as those of the Government with which they disagree. But, unfortunately, the British Executive in Lagos has been accustomed to represent itself to the native countries around as so immediately deriving its power from the Queen of Great Britain, and so essentially reflecting the feelings and views of the Queen respecting them, that any attempt on their part to appeal against its decisions and acts would be altogether vain and fruitless. Hence it has come to pass that, instead of referring to the British Government in England against the injurious acts and hostile policy, and aggrandising encroachments, of the local British authority, they have, to the great injury of themselves as well as of the traders of Lagos, met the injurious acts of the Lagos Executive with reprisals, and closed their roads and markets against us.

Acting under cover of authority, respectable natives have been arrested on pain of being locked up in the guard-room of the Houssas, or seized and deported to St. Helena, without any real cause, while the accused is kept ignorant of his offence. Such, Sir, are the acts of certain officials (European and native) in Lagos, who design to gain popularity, honour, and promotion by misrepresentations. The administrations of Sir Samuel Rowe, Lieut.-Governor Griffith, Captain Moloney, and Captain Rumsey are disparaged by these men. We ask, can a servant be greater than his master? These men say they know Lagos and Africa more than any other person. But what knowledge can be looked for from men whose previous lives have been all unfitted for such duties as they now have to perform? It is honourable to rise from humble positions; yet the mind should be humble; and when uncultivated, to give such persons positions is dangerous. Is it customary for the Premier of England, or the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send a policeman from their official residence in Downing-street to arrest any of the members of the Opposition simply on the report that they speak against the Government, and on their arrival in Downing-street to abuse and insult them, and ultimately send them to prison forthwith, or exile to Canada, saying that the official powers are extraordinary and unlimited?

If to be cursed by a community can make a man happy, ex-Governor Glover must be in the enjoyment of a high degree of felicity. Curses loud and deep are sent after him by the labourer and the trader, from the foodless hovel and the deserted store. We do not know what may be the intention of the authorities at the Colonial-office; but we know that at Lagos it will be felt as if insult were added to injury, should he be gazetted to another Colonial Governorship. All his previous good deeds are obliterated from men's despairing minds, as they see month after month go by, and the flow of produce for commerce arrested through his most wicked and unjustifiable official proceedings, still unresumed, still ruinously stopped. A large number of vessels, which had been sent out for produce, were reported as still on demurrage, and charterers who had their vessels to load, and their engagements in England to meet, were competing at ruinous prices for the small supplies of produce coming in from Porto Novo; prices that must leave them a loss eventually of 30 to 40 per cent.; the only advantage derived by them through such ruinous transactions, instead of at once sending away the vessels in ballast, being that they get something home to meet the pressing demands in England. When the last steamers left, the trade had been stopped five months and two or three days. The losses of the commercial and trading classes generally, in and connected with Lagos, must have been very large; and all through Earl Kimberley's error, and the wicked advantage taken of it by Administrator Glover, for carrying out his peculiar views and predilections in favour of Mahometanism; and gratifying that rooted dislike of the Egbas and other neighbouring native peoples, which had been distinguishing marks of his rule from the very outset of his administration.

We cannot defer the preparations for our paper until the day of its publication, and are therefore under the necessity of commenting on what is known to us at the time we write. We hope, and have reason to believe, that before our present number goes to press, we shall have received the long desired intelligence of the difficulties with Egbas, Jebus, and others being all removed; and of the long desolate markets of Lagos overflowing with produce. We have not any such news at present; but what we have, affords additional proof of the heavy responsibility that rests upon all concerned in the Government of a trading British settlement or colony, when they, through ignorance or malice, pursue a course which is calculated to bring on a commercial paralysis. By inexcusable ignorance on the part of a Secretary of State, and the very wantonness of official evil on the part of an Administrator, the trade and commerce of Lagos was arrested in its course on the 18th of March last. The authorities of the native interior countries from which Lagos draws its commercial supplies, had been goaded by repeated and incessant insults and wrongs, into a condition of mind which led them to refuse all further trading intercourse, until the official author of those insults and wrongs should be removed from the office which gave him power thus to outrage them and their people. At the first glance it would have seemed as if trade would be immediately resumed, from the moment such removal were made, and the obnoxious measures repealed and abolished; and we must confess that, although our knowledge of African thought and action is derived from the varied experience of many years, we fell into the error of believing that such would be the case in this instance. We thought the Egba authorities and the King of Jebu, knowing as they did that the grievances of which they had so much reason to complain were the unhealthy spawn of one diseased official mind alone—that the quarrel really was between them and the late Administrator of Lagos only, and not really between them and Great Britain, would have hastened to show their satisfaction at the removal of their official enemy from his post and power, and have at once set free the fettered hands of commerce. It has not been so. Captain Glover was sent away from Lagos by Mr. Pope Hennessey, on the 15th June—and all obnoxious decrees, irritating and injurious to the Egbas and others, were at the same time repealed; but yet, up to the 6th August at least, the Egbas and Jebus had not removed their interdict on trade. The venom was still rankling in the veins of those who had been stung, and a sense of offended dignity prevented the due consideration of the evils resulting to their own subjects and territories, as well as to Lagos and its traders, from the prohibition to export that produce on which the wealth and progress of both the one and the other depend. Lagos and its native traders and merchants especially have been thus doomed to a prolonged continuance of those evils to which we briefly alluded in our last; and in the paralysis of all available means for paying debts and obligations, the law—British law—has handed the unfortunate fish to the greedy cormorants who are ever ready to seek their unjust gains among the necessities of their fellow-men. British officials spear the fish—British magistrates net them—and British cormorants devour them. We feel it to be our duty, therefore, to repeat the protest we made in our last, against the uninterrupted action of commercial law, through British legal authorities and tribunals, at periods when the British governing power has chosen for its own ends, or in its own ignorance or wickedness, to cut off from the trading masses of the community, those means by which alone they could be enabled to meet their commercial engagements. During the perturbation caused by the late French and German war—during the siege of Paris, and the reign of the Commune, and for some time after, no creditor was allowed to put the machinery of law at work in France, for the enforcement of civil contracts, to despoil and ruin his fellow-citizen. And thus it ought to have been in Lagos during this suspension of trade, which resulted entirely from acts of Government, and not from any acts or errors of individual traders, or from any cause which any one individual of the trading community, or the whole body of them combined, could suspend or control. They did what they could by remonstrance, by petition, by communication to the Home authorities, and through the African Times; and having done this, they are none of them morally, however they may be made legally, responsible for the results against which they petitioned and remonstrated. We do not need any spirit to come from the other world to tell us that these remarks of ours will not produce the effects they ought to produce. The duty of a public writer is not limited by the extent of his power to procure the justice to which he may establish a claim.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

The general reactions of the colonial regimes in seeking to tighten control by the use of physical force and the imposition of legal disabilities were understandable in view of the fact that the period witnessed the expansion of autocracies and illiberal tendencies in Europe itself. But it was not just the opposition of the Africans which was making the colonial regimes insecure. The spread of European ideas and institutions proved a sore point for the colonizers. The general attempt to limit the quality and scope of education was predicated upon the fear that European education and political and social ideas were destructive of colonialism as a system of relations. It was the desire to avert the danger that was looming that explained the general denunciation of education in the humanities at all levels, and the preference for rural schools, vocational schools, and technically-orientated postsecondary institutions which were concerned with intermediate manpower, but not universities. The idea was to avoid the example of India where the spread of liberal education had been a major lever for the expansion of anti-colonial and nationalistic politics. This is the explanation for the orientation and scope of such colleges as the Ecole William Ponty in French West Africa, and the Yaba Higher College (Nigeria), Achimota College (Gold Coast), Gordon's College, Khartoum, and Makerere College in British East Africa. 18 But the attempt to regulate the measure and type of social change that could take place in the colonies was itself another source of anti-colonial grievances that fuelled the nationalist movements. The world economic crisis worsened the situation in two ways. It limited the resources available to the colonial regimes to be viable without any subvention from the metropolis. The general tendency was to keep the colonial regimes going by cutting down on expenditures on amenities and infrastructures that could benefit the colonized by the freezing of job opportunities regardless of the disruptive impact of unemployment on the societies.

To see African nationalism in the inter-war period only as an elitist and urban phenomenon alone as has hitherto been done is wrong. Recent research is showing more and more that a great deal of discontent and anti-colonial feelings were aroused in the rural areas mainly as a result of the new economic and financial measures, the new system of administering justice and, above all, the economic depression of the 1930s. The protest migrations from, say, the Upper Vol ta and Ivory Coast into the Gold Coast in the 1920s, the waves of deposition by their subjects of chiefs, the symbol of colonialism in many parts of Africa, and of course the well-known and well-documented cocoa hold-ups in West Africa,$^{6}$ all this shows that resistance to colonialism in the inter-war period was not confined to the urban centres and the elites only but also found echoes in the rural areas and among the illiterate farmers and workers. Admittedly, research in this area of the extent of rural anti-colonial sentiments and activities, and above all, of the linkage, if any, between the elitist/urban and illiterate/ rural activities in the inter-war period is very much in the embryonic stage, and any synthesis therefore cannot be attempted in this chapter.

The National Congress of British West Africa also declared: That the policy of the Congress shall be to maintain strictly and in› violate the connection of the British West African Dependencies with the British Empire, and to maintain unreservedly all and every right of free citizenship of the Empire and the fundamental principle that taxation goes with effective representation ... to aid in the develop› ment of the political institutions of British West Africa under the Union Jack ... and, in time, to ensure within her borders the Govern› ment of the people by the people for the people; to ensure equal opportunity for all, to preserve the lands of the people for the people.

Consequently, the local population was not protected from the devouring jaws of gigantic firms. If anything, they were exposed for easy destruction. By the first decade of the twentieth century, following the construction of railways, European firms were squeezing African traders in two related ways. Through concentration of capital they undersold small, usually one-man, African firms. In this way the big indigenous West African merchants who emerged during the nineteenth century were pushed out of business. Then the big European firms extended their business from wholesale to retail sale. What T. J. Alldridge said of Sierra Leone in 1908 is applicable to many parts of the British empire: Formerly the large European firms were merchants pure and simple, in the old-fashioned sense of the term ... their business then was strictly wholesale; they imported their goods; they bought native produce and shipped it, but they never broke bulk.

In Nyasaland large numbers of lakeside Tonga and Tumbuka migrated from the Rukuru watershed to outside the sphere of British control to avoid paying taxes; 43 Creation of refugee communities in desolate areas constituted a variant of the withdrawal strategy.

Such interventions often involved the use of British gunboats to bully chiefs who violated the terms of these treaties, or to collect trade debts owed to Europeans. In 1852 John Beecroft even presided at the election of a new chief of Akwa Town. Sometimes British intervention and arbitration was invited by local rulers: for example, by King William to establish his authority over Bimbia and Rio del Rey.

In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence.

When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence.

Is England using her power and influence to press us down when she bids us publicly stand up? Which of the qualifications of Captain Glover merits this appointment? Is it his extravagance and partiality, or is it his irreligious and hostile disposition? Surely if the occupation of Lagos by the British Government is mainly to suppress the slave-trade and to encourage legitimate commerce and to make it a nucleus for the Christianization and civilization of Africa, Captain Glover\'s appointment is an error; he is not ""the right man in the right place.""'}, {'id': 1534, 'article_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

If to be cursed by a community can make a man happy, ex-Governor Glover must be in the enjoyment of a high degree of felicity. Curses loud and deep are sent after him by the labourer and the trader, from the foodless hovel and the deserted store. We do not know what may be the intention of the authorities at the Colonial-office; but we know that at Lagos it will be felt as if insult were added to injury, should he be gazetted to another Colonial Governorship. All his previous good deeds are obliterated from men's despairing minds, as they see month after month go by, and the flow of produce for commerce arrested through his most wicked and unjustifiable official proceedings, still unresumed, still ruinously stopped. A large number of vessels, which had been sent out for produce, were reported as still on demurrage, and charterers who had their vessels to load, and their engagements in England to meet, were competing at ruinous prices for the small supplies of produce coming in from Porto Novo; prices that must leave them a loss eventually of 30 to 40 per cent.; the only advantage derived by them through such ruinous transactions, instead of at once sending away the vessels in ballast, being that they get something home to meet the pressing demands in England. When the last steamers left, the trade had been stopped five months and two or three days. The losses of the commercial and trading classes generally, in and connected with Lagos, must have been very large; and all through Earl Kimberley's error, and the wicked advantage taken of it by Administrator Glover, for carrying out his peculiar views and predilections in favour of Mahometanism; and gratifying that rooted dislike of the Egbas and other neighbouring native peoples, which had been distinguishing marks of his rule from the very outset of his administration. We are informed by our correspondents that there could not be a doubt of the regular course of trade being resumed about the 30th August. We hope this may prove to have been correct; but we had almost equally positive assurances for the 30th June, the 15th and 31st July, and the 12th August. Meanwhile we ask, once more, who is to compensate the victims of official ignorance, error, and perversity, for the heavy losses which they, without fault on their part, have unavoidably sustained? Crushed victims under the heavy wheels of the misguided official car—alas! for them there is, we fear, no possible redress.

Acting under cover of authority, respectable natives have been arrested on pain of being locked up in the guard-room of the Houssas, or seized and deported to St. Helena, without any real cause, while the accused is kept ignorant of his offence. Such, Sir, are the acts of certain officials (European and native) in Lagos, who design to gain popularity, honour, and promotion by misrepresentations. The administrations of Sir Samuel Rowe, Lieut.-Governor Griffith, Captain Moloney, and Captain Rumsey are disparaged by these men. We ask, can a servant be greater than his master? These men say they know Lagos and Africa more than any other person. But what knowledge can be looked for from men whose previous lives have been all unfitted for such duties as they now have to perform? It is honourable to rise from humble positions; yet the mind should be humble; and when uncultivated, to give such persons positions is dangerous. Is it customary for the Premier of England, or the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send a policeman from their official residence in Downing-street to arrest any of the members of the Opposition simply on the report that they speak against the Government, and on their arrival in Downing-street to abuse and insult them, and ultimately send them to prison forthwith, or exile to Canada, saying that the official powers are extraordinary and unlimited? We ask, is this possible? and would such action show a cultivated mind and civility? It is an open secret in Lagos that such treatment is by no means uncommon here.\n\nIt is a blessing that we are under a Governor-in-Chief who is well able to check the ambitious views of his subordinates.\n\nIs it usual for the Premier of England or Governor of a colony to send a superintendent of police with one or two constables to proclaim, without law or ordinance, that no provisions are to be sold to a neighbouring friendly country; and if such country retaliate by stopping its own supply, then for the sovereign of the friendly country to be accused as a barbarous and atrocious king?—Your obedient servants,\n\n**LAGOSIANS.**'}]","[{'document_title': 'How to Conciliate Natives, Etc., in a New Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': '## HOW TO CONCILIATE NATIVES, ETC., IN A NEW COLONY.\n\nThe following is an abridged account of _an affair_ that came off lately at Lagos. Two Europeans on horseback saw a young woman belonging to the household of the Rev. Mr. Crowther drawing water at a public well. They accosted her, and the girl, alarmed, ran to the house of a coloured gentleman, Mr. Cole, which was close by. The horsemen, in full pursuit, chased her into Mr. Cole\'s yard. The screams and uproar brought him out. He asked, ""What was the matter—any harm, Sir? What you come for?"" The answer was a heavy lash across his shoulders from a riding-whip. ""Hallo, Sir,"" said Mr. Cole, ""you come into my house to flog me for nothing. What I do you?"" Mr. Cole tried to eject his assailant, and received a thorough good horse-whipping from both the Europeans before they rode off. Then came a visit to the police magistrate, and a summons demanded. The acting police magistrate, learning who the parties were, advised Cole to settle the matter in a private way. On his persistent refusal, summons was at last issued.

And then makes the following serious charge, in which, we fear, there is but too much truth: ""Europeans, and particularly Englishmen out here, think it a very fine lark to treat a black female, married or single, just as they think fit;"" and concludes by asking, ""If that is the mode by which the white people think to improve their morals?""\n\nOur correspondent expresses his belief that the _chief authority there_ would not sanction such conduct, _if the case could have been brought really under his knowledge_.

Another month, with the year 1873 also close upon us, without any news of the actual re-opening of trade at Lagos.

When are the reasonable hopes of the merchant and trader, based on an estimate of human wants and desires, to be fulfilled? Alas! we know not. Had the British policy at Lagos been a reasonable one, the native people around would have been encouraged, long ere this, to appoint someone to represent them in England—to make known their complaints and desires, and to seek satisfaction for them—instead of resorting to the barbarous system of cutting off communications, and annihilating trade, to the loss and inconvenience of their own people, as well as those of the Government with which they disagree. But, unfortunately, the British Executive in Lagos has been accustomed to represent itself to the native countries around as so immediately deriving its power from the Queen of Great Britain, and so essentially reflecting the feelings and views of the Queen respecting them, that any attempt on their part to appeal against its decisions and acts would be altogether vain and fruitless. Hence it has come to pass that, instead of referring to the British Government in England against the injurious acts and hostile policy, and aggrandising encroachments, of the local British authority, they have, to the great injury of themselves as well as of the traders of Lagos, met the injurious acts of the Lagos Executive with reprisals, and closed their roads and markets against us. What is to be done under these circumstances? The British Government either desire territorial aggrandisement for the Colony of Lagos, or they do not. They either wish that Lagos should be a territorially expanding colony, with all the necessary commitments as regards Imperial expenditure, or they do not. If they do not, nothing can be more easy than to give such assurances, and make such changes, as shall convince the Egbas and Jebus that there is not only no desire on the part of the British Government that Lagos should usurp power and dominion over them, and wrest from them their territory, but that they are entirely opposed thereto, and look upon Lagos solely as a commercial colony, the only conquests of which are to be those of trade and commerce—a promotion of the material development of their countries, and the spread of civiliza...', 'last_edit_date': '1872-12-30', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_12_1872#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Official Correspondence on the Affairs of Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'My Lord,—I had the honour to address your lordship a second time on the state of affairs at Lagos, under date December 30, 1871, and regret to find that my duty again compels me to bring that state of affairs under your lordship\'s notice.\n\nBy the steam-ship Congo, which arrived in Liverpool on the 29th ultimo, I have received, among other letters from Lagos, one from a merchant very largely engaged in the commerce of that place, who writes as follows:—\n\n""There have been great and wonderful changes in the policy of our Government during the last few months.

We have never embarrassed the actual local colonial government by a severe examination of, or strictures upon its acts and ordinances. We have never done more than gently hint, during the reign of the present Governor, that there were some of them we found it difficult to reconcile, to understand, or to approve, without explanations for which we sought in vain. But in the interests of African civilization, of the African people, of legitimate commerce, and therefore of Lagos itself, this sort of indulgence cannot be indefinitely extended. We have given the local government carte blanche for a long period—perhaps for too long a one. The late ordinance issued there makes us feel very strongly that this is the case. It is about the first time in the history and career of our colonies that we have heard, or read, or known of the fact of being a British subject constituting a disqualification for carrying on trade beyond the limits of the colony. This seems to us a monstrous doctrine, or principle, or whatever it may seem fit to his Excellency to designate it.

The importance of Abeokuta as regards the spread of civilization, if in constant friendly alliance with Lagos and in peaceful relations with its African neighbours, is indisputable; and we cannot approve (leaving the past, reopened by the letters we have inserted, for the present unjudged) of any measures that tend to prolong the epoch of alienation after the Abeokuta authorities have made—as it seems to us that they have made—every reasonable concession to Lagos demands.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-11-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1865#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit.

The sale and gift of lands at Ebute Meta by the Lagos Government, constituting as this does an absolute claim and assumption of British authority over that portion of the main land, is a measure of such extreme importance as bearing upon the present and future relations between the British colony of Lagos and the native government of Abeokuta, that nothing short of the most imperious necessity, and the most indisputable and indefeasible claim, can possibly justify such proceedings. There is no portion of the West Coast at which the development of productive resources and the increase of commerce, may be so rapid as in the Abeokuta Territories (with Yoruba generally) and Lagos, provided there be a constantly good and friendly understanding and amicable relations between Lagos and Abeokuta. But for this it is essential that nothing should be done on the part of the Island Government to wound the just susceptibilities, or aggravate the unfortunate distrust of the Abeokutans, as regards British encroachment. The progress of Christian civilisation and material development in the Yoruba countries and primarily among the Aku people, and the increase of the trade of Lagos, are desired results necessarily bound up together and inseparably united. It is not for the permanent mercantile interests of Lagos that she should be mixed up with the wars and disputes of the interior, except as a great civilised pacificator—as the representative of British Christian civilisation acting for the amelioration of adjacent heathen lands. But if Lagos holds absolute possession on the main land, she can scarcely fail to be involved in such native wars and disputes; and it must be expected that questions will continually arise to disturb the friendly intercourse of Lagos with the interior. We regard this matter of the present and future relations of Lagos with the main-land people, and especially with Abeokuta, as one of such very great importance, that we feel it to be our duty to solicit for it the prompt and especial attention of the Governor-in-Chief. Among the gross neglects of duty of Governor Blackall we look upon his conduct as regards this important matter, as one of the most serious, and at the same time, most irritating to native susceptibilities and suspicions. We see with pleasure that the Governor of Lagos has been lately invited to Sierra Leone by the Governor-in-Chief; doubtless for those explanations as regards the Lagos Government which could scarcely be fully given without a personal interview; and as the facts, real or supposed, as viewed by the local Lagos Executive, and the views of that Executive, will now have been brought under the keen and impartial mental scrutiny of Sir Arthur Kennedy, we look forward with hope and confidence to some action of the Governor-in-Chief, that shall lead to a speedy placing of the relations of Lagos with Abeokuta, and *vice versa*, on a just and friendly footing, such as will tend to the permanent reciprocal advantage of the inhabitants of the British colony and of the adjacent native territories.', 'last_edit_date': '1868-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1868#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'TRUE STATEMENTS OF THE CAUSE OF LAGOS DISASTERS.—No. II.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—After perusing the several articles in the English papers (especially the _Manchester Courier_) on the affairs of Lagos, I feel that it is only fair and just to Governor Pope Hennessy that I should relate in your valuable columns a brief history of the cause of differences between the Lagos Government and the Egbas and Ijebus which have caused them to close their trade against Lagos up to this time; and being an African and knowing my countrymen, I think you will agree with me that my statements claim more credence than any which Mr. Charles Leigh Clare (who only wrote from hearsay, and has never been in Lagos) has or can make.

They forget the fact that a wound which can be inflicted in a moment cannot be healed for a long time. I state it as an indisputable fact which can bear any test of investigation, that Captain Glover, during the period of his administration of the government of this settlement (from 1863 to 1872), managed to inflict such serious political wounds on the minds of the Egbas and Ijebus, that it is surprising he and his friends should expect those wounds to be healed in the very short time in which Governor Hennessy tried to heal them. Happily for Lagos Lord Kimberley sent out Governor Hennessy at the time he did; otherwise I cannot say how serious the state of things in Lagos would have become.

I shall only briefly say here that these riotous acts are attributed to a suspicion in the minds of this ignorant people of hostile proceedings on the part of the Administrator of Lagos, which they say the missionaries in Abeokuta have sanctioned, although they must be detrimental to the progress of their great work and the interests of the country at large, as otherwise they would have represented the injustice of such proceedings to their Queen, who is so much disposed to peace; and add, that while they have enemies without their walls, they will not keep one within.\n\nYou will, however, be glad to hear that the Basorun and principal chiefs are doing their utmost to find and restore the property that has been robbed from the missionaries, and that there is every prospect the rioters will be severely punished—the most guilty may even be put to death.\n\nIt is very unfortunate for the merchants and traders of Lagos that these things should have happened, when they were all looking forward to the coming season for a quiet and prosperous trade.—Yours truly,', 'last_edit_date': '1867-10-21', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1867#article-23', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL. ORD, THE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE CONDITION OF THE BRITISH SETTLEMENTS ON THE WEST COAST OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Unfortunately, however, on the whole length of coast on which our eastern settlements are situated, there is no river capable of admitting a ship of any kind (indeed there is but one stream between Sierra Leone and Benin, a distance of 1,100 miles), and in the northern colonies of Sierra Leone and Gambia, both of which possess rivers, there is not the material for such a trade as is found at the oil rivers; their case must, therefore, be admitted to be an exceptional one, and, as such, to afford no ground for the objections which have been raised upon it to the retention of the settlements in their present form.\n\nThe idea of reducing the settlements to the condition of trading ports, with a consular authority to protect British interests, no doubt recommends itself to notice by the impression it creates that the expense, trouble, and inconvenience the settlements now entail would be thus altogether removed; but we are, fortunately, not without experience of the consequences to which such an arrangement would lead.\n\nFor ten years, from 1852 to 1861, the island of Lagos was the residence of European merchants, who carried on an extensive and remunerative trade, for the prosecution of which its position afforded considerable facilities, and which at the same time preserved it to a great extent from the aggression of neighbouring tribes. It was governed by its native king, who was placed on the throne, after the expulsion of the usurper, by the efforts of the British squadron, and was maintained in that position by the same power, and lastly it had the assistance, as British Consuls, of men of ability and local experience, who exerted themselves in every way to promote its prosperity and advancement. The result has been already detailed; after ten years of misrule, Her Majesty's Government, notwithstanding its reluctance to extend the British dependencies on the African coast, was compelled, in the interests of humanity, to take possession of Lagos, and make it a British settlement.\n\nIf such were the consequences of this experiment in a place like Lagos, possessing so many conditions favourable to its success, it can hardly be doubted what would follow an attempt to apply it to places like the Gambia and the Gold Coast, surrounded by powerful and warlike natives, who are now only kept in restraint by the knowledge that we possess the power to enforce submission to our authority."", 'last_edit_date': '1865-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1865#article-20', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFFAIRS IN LAGOS.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'One would naturally have expected that some British official from Lagos would have visited Abeokuta and seen its rulers, or that a resident would have been appointed; but, although it is only seventy miles from Lagos, and can be reached by road or river in three or four days, no British official of any standing, and, I believe, no British official at all, has visited the place for at least twenty years.\n\nIt seems incredible that a walled town with a population estimated at from 60,000 to 100,000, and contributing over £20,000 a year to the revenue of Lagos should be utterly unknown, so far as personal inspection goes, to any British official.\n\nFear of danger or of offending the Egba authorities cannot be the cause of this neglect; if a French officer can go and make a treaty, a British officer might at least venture to do the same.\n\nI think the neglect must be attributed to ""the system,"" that intangible scapegoat of British officialdom, and the sooner it is mended the better.\n\nA travelling commissioner should be appointed, who could visit not only Abeokuta, but Ibadan, Oyo, and Ilorin, and, generally speaking, the countries between the sea and the Niger as far north and west as Boosa.\n\nIndifference as to the interior, followed by French encroachments from behind, has destroyed all possibility of expansion, and has greatly curtailed the revenues of our colonies of Gambia and Sierra Leone.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the same fate will not overtake Lagos. Insignificant and little known as this colony is, the manufactures it imports, and the vessels employed in its commerce, are the means of supplying a living to at least 20,000 of our fellow-countrymen.\n\nSurely this is a sufficient reason for looking after our interests, especially as our doing so can only be productive of good to the interior tribes.\n\nComparisons are often useful, and if the neighbouring German colonies of Togoland and Cameroons can send well-equipped expeditions into the interior and France can spend £4,000 a-year in Porto Novo, from which she has never drawn a penny, surely Lagos can send a commissioner to cultivate friendly relations with the people who, by consuming our manufactures, supply its revenue.\n\nWithout the interior, Lagos is worthless; with it there is the prospect of permanent peace in the interior, and, consequently, a great increase in trade and in the well-being of the inhabitants.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant,', 'last_edit_date': '1889-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1889#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Abeokuta and Lagos', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We, the undersigned, humbly and respectfully beg to bring before your notice the following facts:—\n\nThat for many years past, and previous to the cession of Lagos, we have in common with many others been resident in this place in pursuit of our lawful trade.\n\nThat up to this time we have seen no reasonable cause whatsoever for leaving this place and the commerce we are engaged in, arising from the conduct of the native chiefs or Governments of the country, but; to our great consternation, the Government of Lagos has passed a law which in effect prohibits our residing out of Lagos for the purposes of trade.
