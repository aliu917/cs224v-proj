Observations from the General History of Africa textbook highlight the British efforts to combat sleeping sickness by implementing ecological interventions, such as preventing game from using waterholes, clearing bush, and relocating populations. These actions indicate that the tsetse fly influenced colonial strategies and settlement patterns, posing challenges for local populations. However, the textbook primarily focuses on health implications and colonial responses, lacking detailed information on the fly's impact on agriculture and livestock. In contrast, The African Times news articles provide specific details about the tsetse fly's detrimental effects on cattle and other domestic animals in regions like Zululand, Rovuma, and Umswezwi, aligning with the claim of its significant impact on livestock practices. The articles also discuss the challenges the fly posed to colonial settlement and economic strategies, such as influencing the choice of locations for model farms and complicating livestock transportation. While the articles highlight the fly's association with large game and unoccupied areas, influencing land use and settlement decisions, they do not explicitly connect the tsetse fly to broader agricultural practices or economic development strategies. Together, these sources suggest that while the tsetse fly was a significant concern, its influence on broader agricultural and economic strategies may not have been as extensively documented, with each source providing complementary insights into its impact.","The paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook provide some support for the claim regarding the impact of the tsetse fly on various aspects of African life.

This indicates that the presence of the tsetse fly influenced colonial strategies and settlement patterns, as well as posed challenges for local populations. However, the text does not explicitly discuss the impact of the tsetse fly on livestock and agricultural practices, nor does it delve into the broader economic strategies related to these sectors. The focus is primarily on the health implications and the colonial response to the disease vector.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

On the whole, coastal areas had had a longer contact with Europeans and Arabs than the interior areas. Of the interior peoples, three or four groups had had longer contact with the Arabs than the rest. The Akamba in Kenya and the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika were involved in the caravan trade from the interior to the coast - a phenomenon often referred to as long-distance trade.$^{5}$ The Baganda as well as the Wanga in Kenya had also had contact with Arabs trading in ivory and slaves prior to the 1890s. Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Congo* Basin and Angola', 'section_title': 'Demography, society and politics in high-density areas', 'content': ""The development of more-complex agricultural communities had import› ant consequences for the demography of Central Africa. It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast. By and large the changes were too limited to defeat the major endemic diseases or epidemic outbreaks. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""Was the colonial impact on Africa in the economic field, then, such a very enviable one? Far from it, and most of the present-day developmental problems facing African countries can be traced to this.\nIn the first place, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), the infrastructure that was provided by colonialism was not as adequate nor as useful as it could have been. Most of the roads and railways were constructed not to open up the country but merely to connect the areas having mineral deposits and potentialities for the production of cash crops with the sea or, to quote Fieldhouse, 'to link internal areas of production to the world commodity market',$^{20}$ and there were hardly any feeder or branch roads. Nor were they meant to facilitate inter-African travel and communication. Such infrastructure as was provided was meant, then, to facilitate the exploitation of the resources of the colonies and to link them with the metropolitan countries but not to promote the over all economic development of Africa nor to promote inter-African contacts. In the second place, such economic growth as occurred in the colonies was based on the natural resources of the area and this meant therefore that areas not naturally endowed were totally neglected. This led to sharp economic differences in the same colony. These differences, in turn, accentuated and exacerbated regional differences and sentiments which have been a great impediment in the way of nation-building in independent Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""and that 'the main function of the new rulers was to give impetus to a process of economic development which was already under way'. 53 To this author, there is really no simple yes or no answer to this question since the impact of colonialism varied from area to area and from theme to theme. There is no doubt that in the economic field, the colonial impact was by and large decisive and fundamental and affected both the rural and urban areas. In virtually all parts of Africa, the money economy had become the rule rather than the exception by the end of the colonial period and status even in the rural areas was being assessed not only in terms of birth and number of wives and children but also in terms of cash and the quantity of cash crops that one was producing each season. Further› more, with the introduction of cash crops, land assumed a value that it had not had in pre-colonial days while individual effort and achievement came to be regarded far more than the communalism of the traditional order. The African economy also became integrated deeper into the world economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular than before and this had effects that can probably never be undone. Unfortunately, this integration was effected in a very disadvantageous and exploitative manner for Africa and not even twenty years of independence have funda› mentally altered the situation which has now become known as neo› colonialism."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': 'Fifthly, even though agricultural crops came to constitute the main source of income for most African states, no attempts were made to diversify the agricultural economy of the colonies. On the contrary, as has been shown in some of the earlier chapters, by 1935, the production of only single or at best two cash crops had become the rule - cocoa in the Gold Coast, groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia, cotton in Sudan, coffee and cotton in Uganda, coffee and sisal in Tanganyika, etc. The period after the Second World War did not see any improvement in this area hence most African states, on the attainment of independence, found them› selves saddled with monocrop economies and were therefore highly sensitive to the prevailing international trade conditions.

These did not exist in pre-colonial Africa where, as J. C. Caldwell has shown, until the colonial era, 'nearly all land transport was by human porterage' (Chapter 18). This basic infrastructure had been completed in Africa by the 1930s and not many new miles of, say, railways have been built since then.

Where they are vastly unequal, tribal difference is called in to add protection to economic interest.\' 21 Thirdly, a typical feature of the colonial economy was the total and deliberate negligence or discouragement of industrialization and the pro› cessing of locally produced raw materials and agricultural products in most of the colonies. As Fieldhouse has pointed out, \'Probably no colonial government had a department of industry before 1945\'.$^{22}$ Simple and basic items such as matches, candles, cigarettes, edible oil, even lime and orange juice all of which could easily have been produced in Africa were imported. All African states were, therefore, in accordance with the workings of the colonial capitalist economy, turned into markets for the consumption of manufactured goods from the metropolitan countries and producers of raw materials for export. It is this total neglect of industrialization by the colonial powers and their mercantile and mining companies which should be chalked up as one of the most unpardonable indictments against colonial› ism. It also provides the strongest justification for the view that the colonial period was the era of the economic exploitation rather than the development of Africa. One of the important effects of this neglect of industrialization was that, to a greater extent even than in the political field, few Africans were trained to take over from the Europeans.\nFourthly, not only was industrialization neglected but such industries and crafts as had existed in Africa in pre-colonial times were almost destroyed. It should be emphasized that Africa\'s pre-colonial industries produced all that Africans needed including building materials, soap, beads, iron tools, pottery and above all cloth. Had these manufacturers been encouraged and promoted through the modernization of productive techniques, as was done in India between 1920 and 1945,"" Africa could not only have increased her output but could have steadily improved her technology. But these crafts and industries were all virtually killed as a result of the importation of cheap commodities produced on a mass basis into Africa. African technological development was thereby halted and was never resumed until after independence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns.

In the longer run, those areas most advanced in commercialization first developed a commercial, admini› strative and civil infrastructure: port facilities, roads, trading premises, cash cropping and eventually schools and health facilities and possibly declining mortality levels. In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Finally, what is the record of colonialism in the social field? The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'A second serious social legacy has been the European and Asiatic settler problem. Though there were European settlers in the North African states and in South Africa before the colonial era, there is no doubt that not only did the number of these people increase but European and Asiatic settlers were also introduced into East and Central Africa and parts of West Africa during the colonial days. As M. H. Y. Kaniki has shown above (Chapter 16), the number of Europeans in Kenya rose from only 596 in 1903 to 954 in 1905, to 5438 in 1914 and to 16663$^{ m x}$9$^{2}$9;$^{tnat m}$ Southern Rhodesia increased from 11000 in 1901 to over 35000 by 1926,$^{33}$ and that in Algeria from 344000 in 1876 to 946000 in 1936. But in many areas in East, Central and North Africa, what made their presence so inimical to Africans was that the Europeans came to occupy most of the fertile lands, while the Asiatics monopolized the retail and wholesale trade. In West Africa, too, the Asiatics - Syrian, Lebanese and Indians - whose population increased from only 28 in 1897 to 276 in 1900, 1910 in 1909, 3000 in 1929 and to 6000 by 1935 also drove out their African competitors.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Such armies were, nevertheless, held together by 'a certain esprit de corps and by an iron discipline that was closely modelled on the Nguni warbands'. 24 Supported by such armies, a number of traditional leaders in western Tanzania carved out new dominions for themselves. Some of them even went outside their own localities to establish empires. In the 1850s, for example, Ngalengwa (later called Msiri), son of a Musumbwa headman, followed the copper traders' route to Katanga where he built up a con› siderable empire.$^{25}$ In Unyanyembe itself, there were rivalries among members of the ruling family, intensified by Arab support for one contender for the throne against another. In the 1860s the Arabs managed to have Mnwa Sele deposed and replaced by Mkasiwa, and Mnwa Sele's brother Simba left Unyanyembe to set up his kingdom among the Konongo to the south-west of Tabora. Another member of the chiefly family in Unyan› yembe called Nyungu ya Ma we left his country in 1874 to establish a well-organized kingdom among the Wakimbu to the south-west of the Wanyamwezi. Besides such rulers who went away from their traditional states to subdue a number of small states to form larger ones, there were also examples of states that expanded because of the increased power of their rulers. Mirambo's state is the most striking example, but there were many others. Mtinginya of Usongo in north-eastern Unyamwezi was a hereditary ruler who took advantage of the trade route to Karagwe and Buganda to strengthen and expand his state. Even Isike, the successor of Mkasiwa in Unyanyembe, became powerful enough to offer the Arabs and later the Germans a great deal of resistance."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'The neglect of technical and industrial education and the emphasis on liberal and clerical training and the consequent love for white-collar jobs also created among the educated folk disdain for manual labour and agricul› tural work which is still with us.

Those that are left do less work, are more insolent, and constantly demanding higher wages, and I believe we (the cultivators) will shortly have to bid against each other who will give the highest wages, in order to weed and reap our crops. As the working Kafirs have already more money than they well know what to do with, they are sure to become worse and worse as they get higher and higher wages, and no enterprise dependent on them can ultimately pay; look forward, and a terrible result can easily be seen—ignorance, independence, and bloodshed! Before too late, let me advise all to procure sufficient coolies to reap and bring their produce to market. Employ Kafirs as many as you like, to do extra work and take in fresh land, but have coolies enough to do without Kafirs, if necessary.

The natives have accounted for this fact by assuming the grass to be in fault; but the real source of mischief is now ascertained to be the scourge of Central Africa—this fatal fly. As such an infliction was not observed until recently, it would almost appear as if this enemy of cattle flesh was extending its destructive operations to more southerly latitudes, but we are assured that it is only found along with large game, and in the more unoccupied situations. If this be really the case, Natal cattle farmers need entertain no apprehension.""

A correspondent of the *Indépendance Belge* contributes additional details which show that the achievement is likely to rival in the display of courage and endurance, and also in importance, the journeys of Cameron, Stanley, and Serpa Pinto. The communication is accompanied by a map on which the route taken by the latest trans-African expedition is shown. This map generally confirms the surmises as to the course pursued by the explorers and the discoveries made. It does not show that any connexion between the waters of the Cobango, the river which flows southward from the neighbourhood of Bihé, and the Zambesi has been established. According to the map, Captains Capello and Ivens appear to have crossed the Cobango and proceeded across country until they struck the affluents of the Zambesi flowing through the Barotse-Mambunda country. They then crossed the watershed and entered the Congo basin. The hydrography of this portion of the country differs from the maps published by Stanley and other authorities. The southern portion of the Congo is represented as consisting of two great branches. One of these, the Lualaba, is shown flowing in a north-easterly direction from the Zambesi watershed through Lakes Lohemba and Kassali. The other great branch rises as the Chambesi in the high lands between the north end of Lake Nyassa and the southern extremity of Lake Tanganyika, and flowing down to Lake Bangweolo, is continued through Lake Moero and thence northward along the course of Stanley’s Livingstone. These two great arms may be spoken of, for distinction, as the Luapula and the Lualaba. In the main the hydrography thus described agrees with Stanley’s map, the difference being that the two systems are shown to continue separate up to the vicinity of Stanley Falls, instead of uniting far south of that point and immediately to the west of Tanganyika. It does not appear on what information this modification is based, as Capello and Ivens are not shown to have gone further north than Lake Moero. The total distance traversed by the explorers is stated to have been about 4,500 miles, and of this distance 3,000 miles were absolutely unknown territory. An interesting discovery made was that of the tsetse fly, or African mosquito. The disappearance of this pest from the south-east of Africa has been the subject of comment for a number of years past. The tsetse has generally been found in the vicinity of the elephant, and it has been assumed that it had migrated northward from south-east Africa with that animal. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that Captains Capello and Ivens met with large quantities of enormous elephants, and at the same time abundance of African mosquitoes, in the newly explored country through which they passed.'}, {'id': 6210, 'article_title': 'France and Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'France and Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_05_1892#article-5', 'issue_date': '02_05_1892', 'content': '\n\nWe now pushed on south-west for the Umswezwi, from which good reports were coming in, and soon got into the country infested by the Tsetse fly.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa. They must not expect much from the people themselves.

There were large and mighty rivers, whose alluvial tracts made the cultivation of all kinds of tropical vegetation possible. There were not wanting direct inducements for immigration such as were offered to the white man\'s imagination by the existence of precious metals and precious stones, and a later generation of colonists would be able to use throughout the entire continent, from north to south, iron for their immediate wants, and in many districts coal required by modern industry.

The Native population, which was estimated at about 200 millions, only required to be organised by the whites in order to raise the natural wealth of the continent. A sound connexion of justice with proper severity towards the blacks was the correct principle of conduct to act upon.

The existence of cholera in the latter half of the year, in France, Italy and Spain, necessitated, in consequence of the shipping connexion, the enforcement against those countries of quarantine restrictions. The work of vaccination was resumed during the year with some success. Considerable sanitary improvement was effected in Bathurst by the supply of public latrines, erected over sites under the regular influence of the tide; there were also supplied public dustbins, which are daily emptied by sanitary carts, the contents being buried at the low swampy part of Half Die. An appreciated local exhibition in June of the Gambia contribution of woods and products for the International Edinburgh Wood Fair, 1884, for which a silver medal was awarded, was held in the Council Chamber of Government House, which I allowed to be used for the purpose. In an agricultural sense, comparatively little local encouragement in the past has been given by those who should be specially interested in the subject. Marketable articles, on presentation, are, perhaps, bought; but little or no interest on the part of those to whom it is of most immediate moment is directed towards the development of the resources of the country, by the practical enlightenment of the natives, from whom, in the circumstances, too much is expected, as to what may or may not be in their country of commercial value. The ground nut has stood pre-eminently now for many years as the commercial idol of the Gambia. Native marauding raids for the purposes of cattle lifting or slave catching, or uncertainty of tenure as regards alien states, townships, or villages, have affected and militated against the extent of its growth, while impoverished soil and disease have of late years affected its quality. Manuring is little or not at all resorted to, being cheaply and chiefly represented by occasional bush burning on sites to be cultivated. Natives are conservative, and are indisposed to change sites, which means trouble and increased labour. Everything is taken out of the ground, comparatively nothing is put into it. For instance, as regards ground nuts, both fruit, plant, and root are removed; the first for the oil or confectionery markets of America, the two last as horse or cattle food; and as to corn, the fruit is required for food, home consumption, or sale, and the stalk for fences, thatching, or mats. Of available dyes, and they are many, the indigenous indigo plants (there are two I know of here) offer a field for extensive growth that should prove, not only in the Gambia but on this coast, of much commercial success and monetary return.

One of the speakers suggested that as trade appears to be suffering from the fact that production exceeds consumption, it would be a good thing if capital was more systematically devoted to the work of distribution. We must conclude that some impulse to the distribution of wealth is needed; and a wider distribution of mercantile profits would doubtless be a consequence of the application of the joint-stock principle to mercantile enterprise.\n\nThere is a well-founded belief that the economic development of Africa will be a work of time, and that it is not at all likely to advance by ""leaps and bounds."" The fact is, that so far as the West Coast is concerned, experienced authorities have pointed out that the black man must be interested in cultivation if trade is to be permanent and African communities are to become large consumers of European manufactures. At the present rate of indiscriminate collection, the supplies of ivory must eventually be exhausted, the India-rubber and other plants be destroyed, and the whole country be converted into a waste. It is upon the interior that the interest of the trading and investing public is concentrated, because it is the region of untried possibilities. But the prudent ask whether, assuming the existence of vast stores of produce and favourable conditions of development and progress, markets can be found at paying prices for the produce which Central Africa may yield. It is a question of cost as well as of productiveness. African rivers are interrupted by cataracts from which the great rivers of other continents still only partially developed are free. It is true that the construction of railways is hinted at, but questions arise as to what will be the cost of such railways, who will provide the capital, how long before they become remunerative, and how many transhipments will be required; for it is conceivable that the mere cost of transporting produce to the consuming markets might prove greater than the price obtainable for them.', 'last_edit_date': '1885-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1885#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICA AND ITS TRADE POSSIBILITIES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'On Feb. 13, an interesting lecture, entitled ""A Naturalist on the Mountains of the Moon,"" was delivered at the Royal Institution, Liverpool, under the auspices of the Liverpool Geographical Society, by Mr. G. F. Scott Elliot. The lecture was followed with much interest as an exposition from an authority on the subject. Mr. Scott Elliot, by his recent visit to Ruwenzori, has afforded additional information about this magnificent range of mountains in Central Africa, and his treatment of the subject was graphic and most informing. The address was made the more interesting by a series of limelight views. After touching on the character of Africa generally, the lecturer proceeded to give an account of the mountain Ruwenzori, the various difficulties in climbing the primeval forest, its inhabitants, the bamboo zone, the peat mosses, and the various tribes round the mountain. The occurrence of recent volcanic craters, and the manner in which the cloud hangs over the mountain all day long, only disappearing about sunset, was fully illustrated by slides from photographs taken by the lecturer. The lecturer described his experiences. Leopards attacked his camp, and very nearly killed two of his porters. A woman was carried off by a lioness, and he vainly attempted to rescue her. Elephants were extremely abundant round the mountain. The Natives were usually friendly, though the difficulty of obtaining supplies was often considerable, and on one occasion three of his men were attacked by them, and one very severely wounded. His march to the South was one of extraordinary difficulty, as his caravan consisted only of fourteen men, and the people were in places extremely unfriendly, and on one occasion attacked his porters. The future value of these little-known regions was shown by him to depend mainly on three factors—First, the natural wild resources, as rubber, palm oil, minerals, and ivory; secondly, the prospects of plantation by Europeans; and thirdly, the health of Europeans. The country between 3,000 and 5,000 feet had been proved to be valuable for plantations of coffee and tobacco. It is only in Africa above 5,000 feet that there is any possibility of a real colony being formed. The lecturer expressed his opinion that with the knowledge we have now of these parts, the Masai Highlands certainly appear to be quite healthy enough for Europeans to live and bring up children; but that so far there is no sufficient inducement for colonisation at present. Then, turning to the needs of Great Britain at the present time, he suggested that the three main requisites at present were—first, that our imports of food and raw material should come from our own Colonies; secondly, new markets; and thirdly, an outlet for our capital and population, both of which were unnaturally locked up in Great Britain. These new countries were, according to him, exactly adapted to answer those three urgent necessities.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1896#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Development of the Congo State', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Some interesting particulars of affairs on the Congo have been lately published, showing that, with the development of commerce on the great river, slavery is fast dying out. Boma and Matadi up the Congo, to which ports vessels from Liverpool are now plying direct, are becoming the chief ports from which produce is being shipped, and the facilities at these places are gradually drawing the ivory trade away from Zanzibar. On the upper reaches of the Congo, Tipoo Tib, who up till quite recently has been held up to execration as a slave-hunter, is now diverting the ivory which hitherto carried by slaves, was taken to Zanzibar and other ports on the East Coast. The Congo State has now its officials at the very spot where the Arabs collect the ivory. Instead of making raids on villages and killing hundreds of natives to obtain slaves to carry the ivory to the East Coast, the Arabs can now sell it to the Congo Free State at Stanley Falls, where a regular ivory market at present exists. The Arabs not requiring carriers have no need of slaves except for domestic purposes, and the terrible traffic is said to be gradually dying out. The road from the Upper Congo at Niangwe and from the Tanganika to the East Coast is a difficult one, and often ivory carried by slaves took one or two years to reach the coast by that route. In the neighbourhood of Stanley Falls the former slave-dealers are forcing themselves into a peaceful colony under Tipoo Tib, who has himself discarded his old slave raids and is employing his energies in ruling the people. It is the belief that the Tanganika-Zanzibar route will ere long be entirely superseded by the Congo route. This is the tendency at present, and when the Congo railway is completed the Congo route will be more availed of. Matadi can be reached by ocean steamers, and from Matadi, which is at the foot of the cataracts, the railway will start. Belgian, French, and Dutch houses are now established at Stanley Pool and are buying the ivory, which formerly found its way by caravans to the Angola Coast.\n\nA magnificent river, running parallel with and to the west of the Congo, has lately been discovered. The river, the Lomami by name, was found easily navigable and with a good depth. The Lomami will allow of the navigable Congo system being brought into direct communication with Niangwe, the chief Arab settlement on the High Congo, the Uangolle Lomami being only at a distance of three days' march from that town.

Wissmann, found extensive districts depopulated and burned by the Arabs in the Kassai and Sankaru regions. Then there has been the attack on the Stanley Falls Station. The wave of reviving Arab power which has been spreading westward from the Zanzibar coast is now, it appears, spreading southward also. The first impulse to this extension is said to date from the end of 1883, when for a time our policy of armed intervention on the coast was changed. Every Arab on the coast appears to have regarded this change as an indication that our opposition to the trade had been abandoned. The recent agreement between Germany and Portugal for the division of the country as far as Nyassa, and the limitation of the Sultan of Zanzibar's influence to a coast-zone ten miles wide, have probably also stimulated the Sultan to endeavour to extend his influence to the west beyond the regions claimed by Germany. Arab camps are being placed at commanding points on the slave-routes, and Arabs visit and settle in the villages of the more powerful of the native chiefs. In short, there appears to be evidence that the disturbances on the Tanganyika and Nyassa, and it may be at Stanley Falls, are not due merely to the turbulence of isolated Arab ivory and slave hunters, but are parts of something like a concerted movement.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river. (See Fig. i.i.)

By 1935 European administations controlled almost the entire continent (see Fig. 12.2).

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""vanished populations along the tracks and river banks from which the people had fled.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular.

But the fall in prices and loss of employment were everywhere cruelly felt. 'It was in the price paid to the producer that the decline made itself most heavily felt. The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Finally, what is the record of colonialism in the social field? The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

In those parts of Africa where Africans were not allowed to grow cash crops such as Kenya and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), as Colin Leys has shown, 'within the space of a generation they had effectively been converted from independent peasants, producing cash crops for the new markets, into peasants dependent on agricultural wage-labour'. 27 Sixthly, the commercialization of land already referred to led to the illegal sale of communal lands by unscrupulous family-heads and to increasing litigation over land which caused widespread poverty especially among the ruling houses. In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans. In South Africa 89% of land was reserved for whites who constitute 21% of the population, 37% of land in Southern Rhodesia for only 5.2%, 7% of Kenya for less than 10% of the population, 3% in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for only z\\°/$_{0}$ of the population, and all these lands were the most fertile in each country.$^{28}$ Such appropriation could not but cause much bitterness, anger and frustration and constituted the fundamental cause of the serious explosion that occurred in Kenya known as Mau Mau."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production', 'content': ""It was neither a deliberate policy on the part of British colonial rulers which saved the land in British West Africa for the Africans during the inter-war period, nor was it because of the notorious reputation that West Africa had acquired as 'the White Man's Grave' by the late nineteenth century.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

Any one not accustomed to the contemplation of West Coast enormities would imagine that, putting humanity altogether out of the question, the common instincts of self-preservation would stir up the European officials who are sent out to teach civilisation to the natives to insist upon the adoption and enforcement of those ordinary sanitary regulations which simple decency demands, and which are essential to the preservation of the public health even in temperate, and much more in tropical climates. Yet after forty years and more of British Government authority at Cape Coast, the state of the little town and neighbourhood is such as described. In the presence of so offensive, disgusting, and dangerous a state of affairs, are we not justified in becoming disturbers of official tranquillity? It is no doubt the summum bonum of official life to get as much pay, as many perquisites and indulgences, as much consideration and homage, and do as little work as possible; and it is perhaps an excess of impertinence to criticise the conduct of the favoured mortals sent of course expressly into the world to work out so delicious a destiny. But as a common every-day labourer in the vast field of humanity and progress, we have no sympathy with men who are content to enjoy their mistresses and drink their brandy and champagne upon a dungheap, provided they may occupy the highest position of the stinking mass. For after all, if this description be correct, as we know that it is, what are Government House or any other official abodes in the town of Cape Coast but the most elevated sites on a dangerous and offensive dungheap? The only man in office, so far as we remember, who ever made the slightest move toward doing anything for the purification of the streets and roads of Cape Coast Town was that blundering and arbitrary soldier Governor, Colonel Conran, whose one idea of governing was to bring every individual in the community under the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Our columns teemed years ago, before Colonel Conran\'s time, with denunciations of the public filth and indecency of Cape Coast Town, and of the British officials in power who made no effort to apply a remedy. And now of course, with the increase of population, things have gone from bad to worse. Shame and disgrace and infamy be upon successive governors and administrators, colonial surgeons and principal medical officers, who have attended only to their own selfish aims and enjoyments in the presence of the ever-augmenting abomination. We write with warmth; we have lately lost there a dear and cherished friend, who fell a victim to the pestilential atmosphere, and who, it may be, if governors and administrators had done their duty and made Cape Coast Town what it ought to be as a seat of British authority, might have been spared for yet many years of usefulness in the noble work to which she had dedicated the remainder of her existence. She had, it is true, mental anxieties, and a not over vigorous frame, but it was the pestilential fetor atmosphere of a tropical town full of all stinking abominations that killed her. And there is no excuse. There have now for a long time been abundant funds in the colonial chest—the British Administrator lives in the town—a governor-general goes, or ought to go, there occasionally—there is always one principal medical officer (army surgeon) as well as a colonial surgeon—there is (it is now some nine months or more since he was sent out) a Government civil engineer—and yet it seems that nothing effective has been attempted, and Cape Coast Town and its adjacent roads are one vast public privy and dunghill, upon which, as the Editor of the West African Herald justly observes, a general annihilating pestilence may, and most likely will, suddenly swoop down to carry off its thousands of victims. People who do not know what may be done by officials on the West Coast of Africa will perhaps say, ""Oh, things cannot be so bad as that; the Administrator, &c., would certainly take care of himself, and he must incur the same danger there now as others."" This is a great mistake. Let pestilence swoop down, as is but too reasonably anticipated, and the occupant of Government House, as well as other principal officials, would find no difficulty in obtaining leave of absence on urgent medical grounds. We can see no remedy, no efficient remedy, but a change, and a sweeping one, in the whole official system at Cape Coast. With continually augmenting revenues, soon we hope and believe to be doubled or trebled, no sanitary measures are adopted, no roads are planned, much less commenced; men may be flogged in gaol almost to the verge of death, and then sent to shot-drill to close their mouths for ever, and the Colonial-office sits still and looks on with contented self-complacency and admiration, and will, we fear, continue to look on, until the indignant thunderings of an outraged humanity shall make themselves heard from the mouth of some new Brougham amid the plaudits of an electrified House of Commons.

It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea. The native prejudice as regards interments and dirt, must be respected, or the boasted liberty of the British subject would be infringed; and then a proper system of burial and drainage would cost money!'}, {'id': 4722, 'article_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'full_section_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1883#article-18', 'issue_date': '01_11_1883', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people.

Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past.

Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.738, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Introduction of Present Epidemic of Small-pox into Cape Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—That dreadful disease the small-pox is raging fearfully here, and friends dear and precious in our eyes, and who might otherwise have been our joy for many long years to come, have been swept away by it.

And who does not see in the above short extracts similar causes to those which made Cape Coast so unhealthy a station, before Colonel Conran took the fever bull by the horns and restrained him by sanitary improvements; which, if adhered to and perfected as they ought to be, will reflect lasting honour on his Cape Coast rule, however seriously he may have erred in other important matters?

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.786, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Report of the Commissioner appointed to Inquire into the Condition of the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'All labour is performed by the domestic slaves of the family, who, as a rule, are kindly treated, and are not often parted with, except under circumstances of necessity.\n\nThere is some reason to suppose that coloured traders and trading agents, when following their avocations at a distance from the settlements, occasionally engage in slave-dealing transactions with the natives; but these operations are conducted beyond British jurisdiction, and as yet it has been found impossible to bring any case home to an offender.\n\nIn point of unhealthiness the climate of the Gambia probably varies little from that of the other settlements. There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

Change was coming but few perceived it clearly as is evident from a serious European appraisal of the racial numbers in Algeria in the 1920s: \'Most Frenchmen in Africa had little to fear of there ever being another serious effort to overthrow authority; for, as they point out, there are over eight hundred thousand Europeans to five and a half million natives who have little cohesion and could not do much more than indulge in sporadic outbreaks."" 05 In 1935 Africa stood at the brink of rapid population growth, which would take its numbers - which had already grown according to our estimates from 120 million in 1880 to 165 million - to 200 million by the late 1940s, 300 million by the mid-1960s and inevitably to 400 million in the mid-1970s. Of the latter number, 50 million would be in cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants, a far cry from the Africa of the partition of the 1880s with its debate about creating a labour force.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The years from the early 1880s to the mid-iojos mark the demographic divide in Africa.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

For the fact has been established in the most satisfactory and conclusive manner, that the negro is exempt from attacks of yellow fever; and this is a fact which should never be forgotten, but ought to be constantly borne in mind. We desire not to be misunderstood, or as advocating that the army and colonial medical officers on this Coast should consist only of negro surgeons; all we contend for is, that medical men of that race ought to be exclusively stationed in localities notoriously known to be at present most dangerous to European health and life: and partially in every other colony or dependency on the West African Coast.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.686, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'QUARANTINE AT MADEIRA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Portuguese Government has issued a decree, signed on December 29, which declares that the West Coast of Africa is infected by yellow fever, and subjects ships from that coast to quarantine.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST.\n\n**February 11.**—Information has been received in Liverpool this morning of a serious outbreak of small-pox at Bathurst, British Gambia, and also that quarantine restrictions are again in force at Goree, Senegal.

It was well known that the majority of European residents on the Coast sooner or later became attacked by African fever in one form or another, and even those who merely visited the coast ran risk of being attacked, especially if they were over forty years of age, or were in a low or depressed state. They were also aware that when in the malignant form—""black water fever""—under the present method of treatment the majority of those attacked died. This melancholy state of matters was almost daily brought home to them by the loss, if not of relations or friends, at least of officials, such as captains, managers, clerks, and others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that they should be dissatisfied with the present mode of treatment, and inquire if it was not possible for some improvement to be inaugurated in this respect. Of course the question arose—could the method of medical practice called homœopathic effect any better results? He unhesitatingly said it could, and he spoke after an experience of 35 years in homœopathic practice, preceded by 15 years\' experience in ordinary or allopathic practice. He based this assertion on the published results of the two methods of treatment in the most severe diseases and the worst forms of malignant malarial fever. Unfortunately there were not any practitioners on the coast sufficiently familiar with the resources of homœopathy to be able to demonstrate this on the spot, but it had been shown over and over again in the malignant malarial fevers of tropical and sub-tropical America and India, where similar fevers were much the same as in the regions of Africa; and there the mortality under homœopathic treatment was not one-third that under ordinary treatment. When the mortality in yellow fever under ordinary treatment was about 70 per cent of those attacked, that under homœopathic treatment was about 20 per cent, and in mild epidemics less than 1 per cent. Moreover, statistics showed that the convalescence was much shorter and the recovery more complete. This was because the patients had not been severely drugged with quinine, calomel, or other strong poisons. He had, therefore, the greatest confidence in endeavouring to induce the African Section of the Chamber of Commerce to do its utmost to have missionaries and captains of vessels furnished with homœopathic medicines and directions, and to have homœopathic treatment introduced into the settlements on the coast. With about two dozen one-ounce bottles of homœopathic medicines and a few pages of directions, an intelligent missionary or captain would be able to effect much better results than an ordinary ship\'s doctor with the Government manual and chest of medicines, and to save many valuable lives that would otherwise be lost. It was not only in malarial fevers that the superiority of homœopathic treatment was to be seen. It was the same in dysentery, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, sunstroke, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, and all other severe diseases. By doing their utmost to enable residents on the coast to obtain homœopathic treatment, the African Section of the Chamber would add another to the many and great services they had already rendered to Africa, and would earn the blessings of future victims of African fevers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.709, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Yellow Fever at St. Louis, Senegal', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following was read in the French Legislative Chamber on the 21st December, and produced a great sensation there: ""St. Louis, Senegal, December 7, 1880.—Sir,—Yellow fever has broken out in our colony.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.687, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years.

If we begin by looking at the chief towns of Algeria we see how the task was undertaken. Bona was so unhealthy in 1834 that whole regiments were swept away or invalided. Its death-rate is now stated to be the same as that of the more healthy towns of France. It is situated on a hill rising directly from the sea, and a plain extends from it towards the south at a very slight rise above the sea level, and with little of a natural outlet for drainage. This plain received the rainfall on its surface, together with all the water flowing down from the surrounding mountains, with which its deep, rich, vegetable soil was completely saturated. It was resolved to drain this plain, and the result was an immediate reduction in the sick and death-rate. Boufaric, again, was situated on a marsh, the soil of which was black, oozy, rotten, and saturated with water. A general system of drainage has turned this marsh into a dry, rich, and healthy soil, and malaria is unknown in the town. The drainage of the Lake Halloula has redeemed 34,000 acres of land, which is peculiarly favourable to the growth of the very finest cotton. The effect on the health of the neighbourhood has been such that the intermittent fevers, which were formerly of the worst type, have vanished, and the swarms of mosquitoes which once made life almost intolerable have gone with the fevers.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

By about 1935, the population was undoubtedly grow› ing because of increasing control over mortality, and the basis was laid for a doubling over the next third of a century which almost certainly hastened and consolidated independence.\nMany indices can be used to illustrate the changes between the two dates, and some help to explain the demographic transition. In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""Much of this labour movement in the third of a century after 1880 was accompanied by appallingly high mortality.

Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez.

In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

In the longer run, those areas most advanced in commercialization first developed a commercial, admini› strative and civil infrastructure: port facilities, roads, trading premises, cash cropping and eventually schools and health facilities and possibly declining mortality levels. In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well. In the 1840s the impact of such measures in Algiers was particularly great as the French strove to control cholera. 47', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.643, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': '1 New trends in the Maghrib: Algeria, Tunisia and Libya', 'section_title': 'Libya', 'content': 'hospitals and a central market (1880).

The last measure was the only one to the advantage of the masses (al-$^{l}$atnma); all the other reforms benefited only the middle class, mainly traders, and had the effect of increasing the tax burden of the ordinary people. Their social and economic effects remained fairly limited, however. Despite the growing volume of imported European goods after 1850, the economy remained healthy. Local industry stood up well to competition, and a balanced budget continued to be ensured thanks to esparto exports. 89 But the continual food shortage from 1881 to 1889 was the first sign of far-reaching change. Exports suffered. In addition, the market price of esparto collapsed, the volume of imported foodstuffs increased and from 1892 onwards the balance of trade showed a deficit. This deficit assumed huge proportions and became permanent after 1897. For, from that time onwards, the food requirements of the masses changed. Imported tea, sugar, flour and tobacco were widely consumed in large quantities. Then the income from Saharan trade dried up. Borno ceased to be a source of trade in 1895; Kano in 1903.90 The Sanusiyya was also in difficulty in Barka and after 1901 was weakened by its military operations in Chad. The order became a big landowner in 1902 to make up for the losses foreseen on the trans-Saharan trade, thereby alienating some of its supporters. Lastly, the order was unsuccessful in holding its own against rival orders proselytizing in the region. Around 19 10 the Sanusiyya had fewer settlements than in 1853-91 Under these circumstances, the wealthy European firms that had been established in Tripoli, and also in Benghazi, found it easy to work them¬ selves into good positions. The society was undergoing a process of radical change; the old patterns had been disrupted.

Farther east the Nile routes continued to carry slaves even into the early twentieth century. 33 The firearms trade into and across the desert also continued, despite attempts by European powers to stop it. At Tripoli, and especially at Benghazi, a lively firearms trade was reported in the early 1880s, and many smuggled rifles, especially eighteen-shot Winchester repeaters, were imported for use by caravan escorts. But some of these modern weapons must have reached other nomadic groups as well, allowing them to mount successful raids because firepower added to the tactical advantages of surprise that raiding parties already enjoyed.$^{34}$ The penetration of modern repeaters into the desert seems to have been greatest along the BenghaziWadai route, but other areas were affected as well; Joseph Smaldone has assembled evidence to show that a turning point in the spread of firearms occurred among Ahaggar Tuareg in the 1890s. To the north-west, in Morocco, contraband sales of the i860 model single-shot Remington breechloader were so great that by the end of the century it had become the basic rifle for many groups throughout the country, including preSaharan nomads. Although the evidence is far from complete, increased insecurity on the Tripoli-Kano route after 1898 may have been due to the spread of firearms to raiders. 35 The region surrounding the southern terminus of the Tripoli-Kano trade route provides an example of the economic, political, and religious influence of desert people on the Sudan. In the savanna, the nineteenth century marked the culmination of a process in which the centralization of state structures, Islamization, and economic growth were closely inter› twined.

Indeed, so far from that being the case, quinine with calomel was used by myself and other medical officers stationed in the West African colonies many years anterior to 1850, the time Dr. Livingstone states he had first tried the formula he recommends. Perhaps quinine with calomel may not have been combined with the resin of jalap, as he prescribes; but be that as it may, the practice of giving quinine with calomel had been long used with success at the commencement of the remittent fevers of West Africa, and they were so given either with or without the addition of powdered, not resinous, jalap, as might be deemed best. For example, ten grains of quinine, with an equal quantity of calomel and jalap, were given to a strong adult; the dose being of course regulated by the age and strength of the patient. I have, over and over again, witnessed the almost marvellous good effects that soon followed their exhibition. Even in the worst cases, those of destitute British and Foreign European seamen, who were frequently brought to hospital several days after the accession of fever, and when unmistakable typhoid symptoms had set in, recoveries took place under this treatment; relief from the distressing head and back ache generally following after copious discharges of dark foetid bilious evacuations had passed off from the bowels; the brown leathery sordes disappearing from the lips and tongue, and the skin becoming moist and comfortable. In such circumstances, and, indeed, in all cases of African fever, it is indispensable that the patient\'s strength should be assiduously supported by light, nourishing food and wine.\n\nQuinine was also given with opium, or its alkaloids in solution, or in the form of pills, when the patient was restless, to calm and subdue nervous irritability. It was also frequently given combined with the neutral salts (Epsom, &c.) and purgative and carminative tinctures, if the bowels required to be acted upon. But the chief object was to bring the patient under the influence of the quinine as quickly as possible, the warm bath, and other adjuvant remedies, being likewise used to combat symptoms as they appeared.\n\nI could say a great deal more on this subject; but trust I may have said enough to establish the fact, that Dr. Livingstone has no claim to be considered the originator of the practice of giving quinine with calomel and other purgatives, in the first stage of the paroxysmal fevers of Africa.—Your obedient servant,'}, {'id': 394, 'article_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'full_section_title': 'ASHANTEE WAR', 'last_edit_date': '06-01-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1864#article-5', 'issue_date': '23_07_1864', 'content': '""But this by no means shows the amount of sickness in the camp during that period under medical treatment, for the total treated, but who were not admitted into hospital, were not included.

They were also aware that when in the malignant form—""black water fever""—under the present method of treatment the majority of those attacked died. This melancholy state of matters was almost daily brought home to them by the loss, if not of relations or friends, at least of officials, such as captains, managers, clerks, and others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that they should be dissatisfied with the present mode of treatment, and inquire if it was not possible for some improvement to be inaugurated in this respect. Of course the question arose—could the method of medical practice called homœopathic effect any better results? He unhesitatingly said it could, and he spoke after an experience of 35 years in homœopathic practice, preceded by 15 years\' experience in ordinary or allopathic practice. He based this assertion on the published results of the two methods of treatment in the most severe diseases and the worst forms of malignant malarial fever. Unfortunately there were not any practitioners on the coast sufficiently familiar with the resources of homœopathy to be able to demonstrate this on the spot, but it had been shown over and over again in the malignant malarial fevers of tropical and sub-tropical America and India, where similar fevers were much the same as in the regions of Africa; and there the mortality under homœopathic treatment was not one-third that under ordinary treatment. When the mortality in yellow fever under ordinary treatment was about 70 per cent of those attacked, that under homœopathic treatment was about 20 per cent, and in mild epidemics less than 1 per cent. Moreover, statistics showed that the convalescence was much shorter and the recovery more complete. This was because the patients had not been severely drugged with quinine, calomel, or other strong poisons. He had, therefore, the greatest confidence in endeavouring to induce the African Section of the Chamber of Commerce to do its utmost to have missionaries and captains of vessels furnished with homœopathic medicines and directions, and to have homœopathic treatment introduced into the settlements on the coast. With about two dozen one-ounce bottles of homœopathic medicines and a few pages of directions, an intelligent missionary or captain would be able to effect much better results than an ordinary ship\'s doctor with the Government manual and chest of medicines, and to save many valuable lives that would otherwise be lost. It was not only in malarial fevers that the superiority of homœopathic treatment was to be seen. It was the same in dysentery, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, sunstroke, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, and all other severe diseases. By doing their utmost to enable residents on the coast to obtain homœopathic treatment, the African Section of the Chamber would add another to the many and great services they had already rendered to Africa, and would earn the blessings of future victims of African fevers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.719, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Lamplough's Pyretic Saline"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'LAMPLOUGH\'S EFFERVESCING PYRETIC SALINE,**\n\n**THE REAL PREVENTIVE OF AFRICAN FEVER,**\n\nIs found pre-eminently beneficial in preventing and curing SMALL-POX, by Purifying, Invigorating, and Vitalising the Blood.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The textbook does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim, focusing instead on economic activities like cocoa development and gold mining, and attributing limited European settlement in West Africa more to the lack of mineral wealth and the success of local agricultural producers than to health conditions. It discusses health challenges in Africa, such as malaria and sleeping sickness, and the region's reputation as the ""White Man's Grave,"" but does not specifically address the climate of the Gold Coast's interior regions in relation to colonial settlement. In contrast, The African Times articles offer a nuanced view, noting that the interior regions were perceived as relatively healthier, with reports of Europeans maintaining good health in areas like Axim and the Aburrie Hills, which supports the claim. However, they also highlight the Gold Coast's notorious reputation for an unhealthy climate, particularly along the coast, and discuss the prevalence of other health risks like malaria, complicating the narrative of a conducive environment for settlement. Additionally, the articles mention transport and infrastructure challenges that hindered resource exploitation, suggesting that climate alone was not the sole factor influencing colonial activities.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population. This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.568, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Cash crops', 'content': ""In the case of the palm oil industry, it had served West Africans for centuries, and required few changes either in production or processing.

As a matter of fact, in some cases advances were made despite discouraging official policies and practices. Even the Gold Coast cocoa industry, of which the British were greatly proud, was essentially developed with local initiative. Allan McPhee, one of the en› thusiastic admirers of imperialist expansion into Africa, erroneously gave credit to the colonial administration for the success of the cocoa industry in the Gold Coast. To him 'there seems little doubt that the cocoa industry of the Gold Coast is a foster child of the Government'.$^{26}$ But recent scholarship$^{27}$ has drawn attention to the limited nature of the government contribution to the formative stages of this industry. Indeed, on a number of occasions, agricultural experts, who were paid substantial salaries from the taxes of the agricultural producers, proved more ignorant than the producers, and their advice proved disastrous.$^{28}$ Despite the misguided activities of the Agricultural Department, the industry expanded. Starting from almost nothing in the early 1890s, by 1903 the farmers had put over 17000 ha under cocoa. By 1928 there were 364000 ha of cocoa.$^{29}$ Within two and a half decades cocoa replaced both rubber and palm oil to become the leading domestic export.$^{30}$ In 1934 the Gold Coast produced 40% of world output. Yet until this time the industry had benefited little from scientific research carried out in the country. As the West African Com› mission observed: It is ... extraordinary that until 1937 there was no single agricultural station in the cocoa belt proper at which research could be carried out on the requirements of the crop. It is difficult to see how any officer of the Department could be expected to offer correct advice on cultural or other treatments, as he had no opportunity to acquire knowledge under the local conditions. 31 Real government contribution to peasant"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.565, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy: the former British zones', 'section_title': 'Ownership of the means of production > Minerals', 'content': ""A number of the former British dependencies of tropical Africa were rich in a variety of mineral resources (see Figs. 16.2 and 16.3).

This chapter seeks to examine the nature and major characteristic of these economies.\nThe British, like other colonizers, did not develop a universal theory of colonialism which could embrace all aspects of life in all colonies. Nor did they develop anything near a universal practice of colonialism. Indeed this was impossible as colonialism was imposed on peoples with extremely diverse cultures and backgrounds, and living in widely differing environ› ments. Much was left to the administrators to deal with situations depend› ing on the local conditions. Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods. Third, the colonies had to be self-supporting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.564, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease.

It was only in the southern Gold Coast, and to some extent in western Nigeria, where a substantial proportion of farmers successfully organized their cocoa farms upon a capitalist basis.$^{22}$ The unspecialized producers could not take full advantage of market opportunities to maximize their profits during the boom years. 23 But since they were only partially integrated into the international capitalist system, they were neither fully exposed to adverse international economic conditions, which were far beyond their control, nor fully subjected to different forms of colonial exploitation. The main cash crops grown by small-scale farmers comprised cocoa from the Gold Coast and western Nigeria; palm oil and palm kernels from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and to a lesser extent, the Gold Coast; groundnuts from The Gambia and Northern Nigeria; cotton from Uganda, Nigeria and Tanganyika; and coffee from Uganda and Tanganyika (see Figs 16.1 and 16.2).

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.553, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.554, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Arrests were made and fines imposed by chiefs to maintain the hold-up.

The abolition of the slave trade, which accounted for nine-tenths of the Gold Coast's exports at the beginning of the century, abruptly altered the economic situation. By 1840, however, palm oil had already succeeded the slave trade as the coast's leading export product, a development that was largely due to Maclean's policy. Palm oil was followed in the 1870s and 1880s by rubber, and both laid the foundations of structural changes in the economies of the southern Gold Coast.\nWhile Asante and Voltaic gold moved southward for the most part, kola nuts moved northward. The more westerly routes through Kong and Buna, however, were steadily abandoned in favour of the north-eastern routes through the Dagomba and Hausa country, as Thomas Bowdich reports.

Part of the gold was hoarded in the form of dust or nuggets in bamboo stalks or pieces of cloth, hidden in attics, or buried in earthenware pots. It was carried via local and regional trade routes, sometimes to Bobo, San, Jenne and Mopti, sometimes to Kong and Asante, sometimes to Gaoua (Lobi) or Salaga via Wessa and Wa, and sometimes to Wagadugu and onward to Puytenga, Tenkodogo and Salaga. In local trade it was used to purchase salt, kola nuts, boubous (loose ankle-length robes), slaves, livestock and grain. According to L. G. Binger, bar salt from the desert was much more highly regarded than other kinds. It came from Taoudeni by way of Timbuktu, Mopti, Jenne, Bla and San, subsequently being distributed throughout the Sahel and the savanna country. The same was true of the salt that reached Segu by way of Adrar and Tichit. Sea salt from the coast and salt collected from the river saltpan at Daboya was carried as far as Kong. In the Volta region of the Sahel, the chiefs of Jiibo developed a cunning technique for accumu› lating slaves. If a slave killed someone and then gave himself up to the chief, he would be acquitted and would become the property of the latter; in cases of theft, if the thief was rich the chief would strip him of his wealth.$^{54}$ By the end of the century, the population of Dori included 50000 free men and 50000 captives. Yet the careful and observant traveller, Heinrich Barth, who passed through the region in 1853, says nothing about slaves in his account. This points to a substantial increase in slave-trading in the region during the second half of the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.56, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 238, 'article_title': 'Cape Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Cape Coast', 'last_edit_date': '10-14-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1863#article-4', 'issue_date': '23_11_1863', 'content': 'Mr. Editor,—That state of calm which precedes a storm is the state in which this epistle leaves us on the Gold Coast. There is little or nothing to report this time in the way of political news. There has been considerable excitement, and more indignation, created here by a letter published in the Times of August 21, and signed ""An African."" Conjectures are rife as to who this impostor can be. Nine persons out of ten maintain that, without a doubt, it is a Government officer expected out here from England next mail. Some assert that it is the steward of one of the mail steamers; others again wager that it can be none other than Senhor Domingo José Martinez himself. All, however, agree in one point, that, whoever he is, he ought to be ashamed of himself for attempting to pass off such weak rubbish.\n\nThe officers of the late Gold Coast Artillery took their departure by last mail at the unwonted hour of 11.30. P.M. That was the time at which they left the beach—a very appropriate hour for them to make their final disappearance from a place where they had caused so much mischief. The blood of their men who were shot last year for mutiny, and the sufferings of the fourscore who are now in the Convict Gang at Sierra Leone for the same heavy crime, call continually for an inquiry into all the circumstances connected with that mutiny. We cannot help thinking sometimes that had these men been white English soldiers, instead of black English soldiers, the vindication of military discipline would have been followed by a general court of inquiry as to how far their officers were to blame. We still hope that such an inquiry will be made.\n\nThe jawbone of an Ashantee man was brought down here last week, as having belonged to a spy killed by the scouts of our chiefs in the Denkera territory; but whether the poor fellow was one of the scouts of another army of invasion, as some think, or merely a solitary seeker after bush snails, as others suppose, I can\'t decide. The Coast is remarkably healthy at this moment. There is very little trade, though, less provisions, and no water at all, the season having been fearfully dry. For three months past in some coast towns water has actually been scarcer than rum and gin, and sold in pots in the market almost as high as those two poisons. The Coast is at this moment entirely free from mosquitoes and Yankees. Both disappeared about the middle of last month.

He disagreed with the right honourable gentleman as to the policy of keeping their troops restricted to this little island; for he thought the expenditure incurred on account of their colonies returned a hundredfold to them in the shape of imports. Unless they broke through the Coast, which he might describe as the crust of Africa, they would not be able to penetrate into the interior of the country. He would ask them to compare the West Coast with the East Coast of Africa, where they had no settlements. Let them compare the civilization, the education, the commerce of the West with what they saw in the East. It might be true that the suppression of the slave-trade had not been brought about by the establishment of these settlements; but the reason why the slave-trade flourished on the Coast was that there was not a vessel in our squadron which could go more than nine miles an hour, so that the evil flourished through a deficiency of administrative ability on the part of a department of the State. As for the climate of the Gold Coast, he believed it was not so bad as the climate of either Sierra Leone or the Gambia; and therefore its climate afforded no reason for its abandonment. The settlement at Lagos had not succeeded because the Governor, Mr. Freeman, had not been well selected. The honourable member concluded by complaining that no account of the military expenditure on the Ashantee war had as yet been laid upon the table.\n\nMr. A. Mills deprecated the habit of blaming particular Governments for our policy on the West Coast of Africa; it was the Parliament of England that was mainly open to censure for having allowed a policy to be persisted in which at any moment it might have put an end to. At the same time, he entirely condemned the policy of attempting to enforce a protectorate over tribes on the West Coast, as unwise in itself, and as unlikely to conduce to the suppression of the slave-trade. He thought it would be a valuable thing if the whole question of the protection of these native territories was discussed by a committee of the House.\n\nLord C. Paget, in reply to several questions as to the squadron on the Coast of Africa, said he had not heard that any slaver had escaped from our cruisers. It had been stated that four of our steamers were in pursuit of a slaver, and that she got away. He could quite understand that fast American steamers would be employed, or were now being employed, in this trade, and it was quite true that we were in want of fast steamers all over the world.

The Native Chiefs or Kings, who held sway over large numbers of men, women, and children, could enforce their working for gold, and a very small quantity produced by each daily would, in the aggregate, amount to much. Thus, supposing a King or Chief ordered his men, who were mostly slaves in those days, to get him gold, they had to do it—5,000 Natives washing in their crude way with wooden dish bowls or shells, and each averaging only ¼ dwt. or 1 dwt. of gold per day, the total would amount to a handsome sum every week; and this is how the kings and headmen of the various tribes were always known to be wealthy in gold and slaves, and it gave encouragement to the development of trade and traffic (which was so profitable) in those articles, for which this unhealthy coast was so noted.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Bridges’ contention that, taken generally and under proper precautions, the climate of the Gold Coast was not so unhealthy as usually represented was supported by a communication from Mr. L.

Nearly all the Government officials are stationed immediately on the coast-line, although it has been proved that the healthiness of the climate improves as one proceeds inland. At a distance of seventy to one hundred miles up the Ancobra river the features of the country change; numerous steep hills are met with, and many of the streams contain clear water running over rock and gravel beds.

In these reports are given the death and invaliding rates occurring among Europeans of all classes serving at the time on the coast. The greatest care was always taken to obtain reliable data on these subjects both from members of the medical staff and the district commissioners at out-stations, and I had every confidence in the accuracy of the reports submitted to me by these officials.

Although our connexion with it has been for a period approaching two and a-half centuries, so little notice has been given to it that it is in almost as undeveloped a state as when we first came into contact with its peoples. Perusal of the letters and articles from correspondents who recently accompanied the Ashanti expedition on its march from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie brings forcibly to one\'s mind how sadly we have been lacking in our duty in this sphere. Rich almost beyond compare in mineral and vegetable products, this field of wealth has been permitted to remain all but uncultivated. No strenuous efforts appear to have been made to open up the country; there are no roads to speak of, there are no facilities for inland transport—even at this day every gallon of palm oil, every hundredweight of rubber, every fathom of cloth, and every pound of gunpowder has to be carried on men\'s heads to and from the interior, and this in a land abounding in auriferous metal. One naturally asks—Why should this be so? The answer is not far to seek. There are several causes which account for the backwardness of the Colony, the main being the reputed unhealthiness of the climate. On this point there cannot be any doubt as to its not being favourable to Europeans, especially if they come here with constitutions in any way enervated by previous excesses, or if they indulge in excesses of any kind while here. It is imprudent for a white man to come to West Africa unless his constitution is perfectly sound and every organ in his body unimpaired; but if he is in perfect health, and will exercise ordinary care, take good food, live regularly, practice sobriety, work hard when he is at it, and will not (to use a vulgarism) funk when he has a touch of fever, he will run no greater risk on the Gold Coast than in other tropical countries. There are many Europeans known to the writer who have been in this country eight, ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty years and more, with periodical visits home, and who in the majority of cases have remained in the Colony three, five, and seven years at a stretch; yet in none of these instances were the parties total abstainers, but they were temperate in all things and enjoyed perfect health. Yet these men lived in times when less attention was bestowed to sanitary matters. With ordinary care the healthy European runs no risk. Now the authorities are becoming alive to the necessities of better sanitation, and some efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the principal sea-coast towns. That the country has suffered in no inconsiderable degree by its reputation for unhealthiness is evidenced by this passage which I cite from an official source: ""Against the development of the Colony by means of English capital there lies upon it the stigma of a baneful climate. But I cannot help thinking that by clearing the waterways of the Colony and thus improving the drainage of the country, by converting the bush tracks into decent roads and so improving the ventilation of the country, by a gradual conversion of the dense bush into cultivated areas, by the enforcement in the interior towns and villages of the sanitary laws which have proved so useful and advantageous in the coast towns, and by improving the means of transport, thereby enabling Europeans resident at a distance from the trade ports to have ready access to good food and the various comforts of civilisation to which they have been accustomed, and which they more than ever want in a tropical country—the climate of the Gold Coast will lose its notoriety, and the country will become, equally with other tropical countries, a safe means for the investment of capital."" But beside the climate the greatest hindrance to the rapid development of the country and its trade has been the want of proper means of transport. So long as the primitive method of carrying everything on the head prevails, the amount of trade must necessarily be narrowed still the volume of trade for 1894 shows an increase roughly of 13 per cent. over 1893 with the United Kingdom, and of 22 per cent. with foreign countries, being respectively £1,190,532 1s. 3d. against £1,054,386 17s. 6d., and £429,708 1s. 4d. and £350,387 3s. 5d. This gives one some idea of what the increase is certain to be when the produce-yielding districts of the colony are tapped by good roads and the ""iron horse."" The Government, it is said, are organising a roads department, and surveys have been made for railroads, none too soon, for they are indispensable in a country where cattle (including in that category horses, mules, and donkeys) will live only in certain localities. Irrespective of the necessity for roads and railways for produce, the same facilities for access to the gold mining districts cannot be lost sight of; it is the yellow metal which has given its name to the colony. Since the fifteenth century it is estimated that six or seven millions of gold have been exported from the goldfields. Anterior to the discovery of Australian or Californian gold the principal supply of the auriferous metal was obtained from the West Coast, in particular from this land. Whoever has travelled over the country has been struck with indications of the precious metal almost everywhere. It outcrops in reefs, it is discovered in sand, and found in the beds of its rivers; you will see it being washed for in the streets. Why, then, has not the country become a great gold mining centre? I doubt very much whether California itself ever presented to the naked eye the tempting wealth of gold which so forcibly attracts the attention of the traveller in the western districts of the Gold Coast. With plenty of capital for the developments of its properties and under European and native control, any enterprise for the development of the gold industry in this colony ought to be a substantial success.—*Liverpool Journal of Commerce.*', 'last_edit_date': '1896-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1896#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Report concludes as follows: ""The Colony has within it all the essentials for prosperity: rich in gold, in valuable timber, in soil which will produce almost any commodity of trade value, it is already attracting the attention of capitalists, and with finances and trade in a satisfactory state there is no reason why it should not advance in material prosperity and bring wealth to English merchants and Native producers and workers.', 'last_edit_date': '1897-04-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_04_1897#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.634, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Gold on the Gold Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This climate-question, of which so much has been said in England, would hardly have occurred to an old coaster.

""I thought you were fever-proof,"" has been said to me more than once; but a man is never fever-proof in Africa, and rarely cold-proof in England, at least as long as he breathes the upper air. And we gave the climate no chance. New arrivals are advised by all old hands to avoid, for the first three months, over-exertion of mind or body. This, in our case, was equivalent to prescribing a generous diet of beefsteaks and port to a pauper patient. We had to do in twenty-four hours the work of forty-eight; we walked instead of hammocking, the better to collect specimens; and my companion, after a heavy day\'s work, often sat for hours in the dewy night to make his observations. Nor did we stay long enough to become acclimatised. Under other circumstances, we should have passed, at the end of a month or so, through a mild seasoning of ague and fever; and, after the third month, we should have been fit for any amount of exertion. I repeat, that in our case the climate had no fair play.\n\nBut look at things as they are. Of the four English managers of mines, three have retained vigorous health after years of residence on the coast. Only one suffers from rheumatic gout—a complaint certainly not confined to Western Africa.

I see sundry in this room, as good men as if they had lived in England all their lives.\n\nAnd now, permit me briefly to recapitulate. The good news we bring home is the prodigious wealth of the land; I know nothing to equal it in California or in the Brazils. Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore. Gold spangles glitter after showers in the streets of Axium. Gold is yielded by the lumps of yellow swish that rivet the wattle walls of hut and hovel.

But Mr. C. J.

I fear the Captain\'s experience must have been singularly unfortunate. There is no doubt there are certain localities on the coast-line where it is not desirable to make a prolonged stay. I specially refer to those places where an extensive lagoon exists between the beach and the mainland. But this is not the case with the port of Axim, where a gradual rise of ground occurs from the shore, and there is no swamp at the back.\n\n""Although Captain Montgomery ridicules the idea of calling Axim a \'port,\' it has been so designated by the late Sir Richard Burton, Commander L. V. Cameron, C.B., R.N., and others, and it is admitted to be one of the best landing places on the coast, all the heavy machinery for the mines in the Appantoo and Takwa districts having been landed there without unusual difficulty.', 'last_edit_date': '1895-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The general fiscal condition of the Gold Coast, as described in a Colonial Office report lately, ""was not only satisfactory but flourishing"" during the last financial year. Revenue and trade increased, although there is no other Colony in the Empire which has the advantage of being so lightly taxed; so that the imposition of additional taxes should not be difficult when the time comes for various public works, especially those needed to improve the sanitation and to develop the country. The total trade amounted to £1,809,340, of which exports absorbed £877,803. In the last six years the trade has increased upwards of 55 per cent. The chief imports are piece goods, hardware, food-stuffs, and alcohol, while the exports are palm oil and kernels, rubber, gold dust, &c. The Customs revenue is largely derived from spirits, and the Acting-Governor takes occasion to mention that the reputation of trade gin as specially deleterious is undeserved. From an analysis, which he gives, it appears that West African trade gin is not more or less deleterious than the gin sold all over London. The export of palm products amounted to about £225,000, and that of rubber to about £330,000. In the last six years about a million monkeys have been slaughtered on the Gold Coast for the sake of their skins; but this trade is decreasing, because the traders have to go further into the interior to find the monkeys they require. Last year over 90,000 skins, worth over £14,000, were exported.\n\nThe land in the Colony is not generally sufficiently cultivated, though the soil is rich and will produce almost any commodity. It abounds in the oil palm, mahogany, rubber and kola trees, and many other valuable woods; but, chiefly on account of the absence of proper roads and the general ignorance of the Natives, products which require a careful preparation of the soil and supervision have not been cultivated systematically.\n\nOn the subject of communications a passage from an address of the Governor to the Legislative Council is quoted: ""The conditions under which bulky produce is transported from the interior to the coast are such that, beyond a certain distance inland, products have no commercial value; a new producing sphere could be tapped if a railway of fifty or sixty miles in length were constructed, and trade could be further developed by the gradual extension of the line; it is therefore desirable to carry a railway inland from the place best adapted for development as a harbour.

In Africa it was necessary to employ black labour; the Kroomen were very good workers, and soon learned how to use a pick and a drill; but when you were working with two or three of them in a level, at any depth, artificial ventilation would be very necessary. The wages were about 1s. 3d. or 1s. 6d. a day; and if the companies were to fix some such rate, it would be very fair, and the men could earn good wages at it. The question of white men\'s health would also have to be studied, and one very necessary thing would be to avoid over-indulgence in stimulants, for that was one of the greatest curses on the coast.\n\nMr. Walker did not think any European would ever be able to stand the climate of Africa without a moderate amount of stimulant. He had passed upwards of thirty years there, and he did very well on two bottles of whiskey a week. There was no doubt about the richness of the country, and it was only a pity that Captain Burton was not able to see more, because, from his large experience in other auriferous regions, his testimony was of the greatest possible value.

Burton, has told us that last year, when surveying the Akankoo concession, he worked for days together up to his middle in water, and lived! Captain Burton himself, in a letter written in February last to the directors of the Guinea Coast Gold Mining Company, speaking of Apollonia, says ""During the hot hours the doctor—that is, the sea breeze—blows freshly; the evening temperature is delicious, and during the cool dewy nights we found blankets necessary.""\n\nI visited all the mines then being worked, and saw upwards of thirty Europeans, of various nationalities, who both worked and lived. I also saw very large numbers of natives, as well as several hundreds of Kroomen, who worked regularly, both day and night, at the mines, and in transporting heavy machinery and other goods from Axim to the different mines at and near Takwah. I travelled partly by hammock, partly by boat and canoe, as well as on foot, over Wassaw, Egwira, Apollonia, Axim, and Apatim, meeting hundreds of native carriers transporting provisions, pieces of heavy machinery, and other articles, by road and river, without overseers, and by whose means, aided by Kroomen, everything now at the mines had been carried there, with little loss by accident or theft. I slept in native huts without doors or fastenings; and at Axim, my bedroom door and windows remained open day and night; yet the whole extent of my loss by theft, during six months, was one plated table-fork stolen on board a steam launch! Surely this does not look as though the ""natives cannot be induced to work,"" or that ""the people are debased beyond conception.""

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF NATAL', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In a paper read before the Royal Geographical Society by Dr. R. J. Mann, ""On the Physical Geography of Natal,"" the author exhibited numerous diagrams and maps in illustration of his subject, which was to show how the peculiar climate and fertility of Natal depended upon its physical configuration. The colony was a portion of the narrow, bevelled rim of the African continent, whose vast interior is an elevated table-land, with its coasts presented to the moist winds of the Indian Ocean, and its interior frontier formed by the Drakenberg mountain ledge 7,000 to 9,000 feet high. From the salient point of the angular line of the Drakenberg a mountain ridge projects into the middle of the colony, forming a high central backbone, from which short lateral spurs jut out. Each deep valley has its stream, and no less than fifty separate rivers find their way to the coast. There is a general slope upwards from the sea towards the interior, the gradient for the first seventy miles being 1 in 70. Up this slope the sea breezes, impelled by the eastern trade-wind, blow almost continually, but most strongly in the summer, owing to the power of the sun on the land, and it is in this season that most rain falls, the moisture-laden air, on reaching the rising land, being no longer able to retain its humidity, and therefore discharging it in almost daily showers. During the winter, on the other hand, when the monsoon agency is at its least, there is almost perpetual sunshine, and the weather is dry. The summer rainfall, as the author had ascertained during eight years\' observation, is about 24 inches; the winter rainfall only 6 inches. The temperature in summer commonly rises to 85 deg. at midday, rarely to 97 deg., and at night very seldom descends to 52 deg. In winter it rises to between 70 deg. and 80 deg., and rarely descends to 40 deg. There were five slight frosts in the eight years. The result of this peculiar climate, dependent on the geographical position and configuration of the land, is that sugar, coffee, arrowroot, pineapples, bananas, and oranges can be grown on the coast, while wheat, potatoes, and other good crops, cattle, horses, and sheep thrive on the uplands, the whole colony being only equal in area to one-third of England.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

In 1880 a European presence inland from the coast was largely restricted to Algeria, where a third of a million migrants, mainly from France, Spain, Italy and Malta, had consolidated the victory of the French army, and South Africa, where a similar number of Europeans, predominantly of Dutch and English extraction, now had a vanguard as far north as the Limpopo river.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905.

In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Commerce was one, although whether such activities brought prosperity and the ability to buy food in times of need and perhaps some health care in the few places where it existed to a greater degree than it brought disease arising from increased contact with strangers is debatable. By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

What we advised is reasonable; our connection with the West Coast of Africa is not of yesterday only; Lamplough's Pyretic Saline is not a new and unproved medicine;* and Her Majesty's Government and the Army medical authorities know all this. If, therefore, the lives and health of those officers and men who have been dispatched to the Gold Coast, or may yet be dispatched thither, should have been sacrificed by neglect of the simple precautions we have so earnestly recommended (as we consider the lives and health of that detachment of Marines sent out in June last to have been), one pen at least—our pen—will not fail to expose the wrong that will have been committed. We have been long known in West African matters as the champion of the weak against the mighty,—and who so weak as officers and soldiers commanded by the authorities of their country to penetrate the fever haunts of Western Africa, unless they be even lavishly provided with every tried protection? The official reports from the Gold Coast as to the health of officers and men already there, fill us with gloomy apprehensions. We would discard them, were it possible, but we have tried in vain; and it has therefore become our duty to enter the lists once more, on behalf of officers and men who have been dispatched, or may yet be dispatched, on duty to the Gold Coast. We earnestly recommended Lamplough's Pyretic Saline, with Quinine, as a preventive, and Warburg's Tincture as a restorative. They are both long-tried medicines, well known to the medical profession; and we emphatically re-affirm that if, in consequence of these medicines not having been adequately provided and administered, the health and lives of officers and men dispatched on the Ashanti Expedition shall have been sacrificed, to the grief and misery of individuals, and the injury of Her Majesty's Service, a heavy responsibility will fall on those whose negligence or prejudices may have caused such results."", 'last_edit_date': '1873-12-31', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1873#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Native African Customs.—Advantages of British Protection', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Sparks, Government Medical Inspector of Emigrants from the port of London, writes: ""From my personal and professional use and knowledge of the value of Mr. LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE, for many years past, I have great pleasure in bearing my cordial testimony to its efficacy in the treatment of many of the ordinary and chronic forms of Gastric Complaints and other forms of Febrile Dyspepsia.—August 5, 1857.""\n\nFrom G.

That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence.

The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

The labourers were often shifted to areas which exposed them to new diseases; but in addition Africans apparently immune to malaria in their home areas developed not only virulent malaria in distant areas but even blackwater fever.$^{61}$ Some of the migrant labourers did not observe the careful sanitary arrangements which exist widely in Africa, especially defecation in areas outside the village and away from streams$^{62}$ thereby polluting their water supplies and spreading dysentery and the newly introduced diseases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized. In Nigeria, a dispensary was opened in Ibadan in 1904 and others followed in Yoruba towns in succeeding years.$^{81}$ By 191 o the Sierra Leonean government was awarding prizes to the chiefs of the two villages in each district which had shown the greatest improvement in sanitation.$^{82}$ By 1934 Uganda had hospitals in all major centres and eighty-eight sub-dispensaries in rural areas which recorded 1378 545 attendances during the year.$^{83}$ One should not exaggerate the significance of these changes: in many dispensaries drugs were few and attendants uncertain about what to do, as has remained the position in much of rural Africa until the time of writing. AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising. Health conditions of this order have lingered on almost into our own time in remoter parts of the continent. Surveys in Mali in the late 1950s and Upper Volta in the early 1960s have yielded adjusted data suggesting crude death rates of close to 40 per thousand and infant mortality rates of close to and even exceeding 300 per thousand.$^{21}$ However, this situation is incompatible with stability in the Middle Africa low fertility zone if the birth rates now claimed for that area are supposed to have persisted at that level from the past. Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences.

Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HOW TO DECREASE MORTALITY IN WEST AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'What the French have done during the last years in Algeria is, indeed, most remarkable, and the lesson to be learnt from it is, that the work of reducing a death-rate from eighty in the 1,000 to fourteen in the 1,000, though not a slight one, is not an impossibility. If we begin by looking at the chief towns of Algeria we see how the task was undertaken. Bona was so unhealthy in 1834 that whole regiments were swept away or invalided. Its death-rate is now stated to be the same as that of the more healthy towns of France. It is situated on a hill rising directly from the sea, and a plain extends from it towards the south at a very slight rise above the sea level, and with little of a natural outlet for drainage. This plain received the rainfall on its surface, together with all the water flowing down from the surrounding mountains, with which its deep, rich, vegetable soil was completely saturated. It was resolved to drain this plain, and the result was an immediate reduction in the sick and death-rate. Boufaric, again, was situated on a marsh, the soil of which was black, oozy, rotten, and saturated with water. A general system of drainage has turned this marsh into a dry, rich, and healthy soil, and malaria is unknown in the town. The drainage of the Lake Halloula has redeemed 34,000 acres of land, which is peculiarly favourable to the growth of the very finest cotton. The effect on the health of the neighbourhood has been such that the intermittent fevers, which were formerly of the worst type, have vanished, and the swarms of mosquitoes which once made life almost intolerable have gone with the fevers. Thus, the result of deep drainage and fertility has been permanently favourable to health, and the land which has been made to support life has shown itself grateful to its cultivators.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1867#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'HEALTH ON THE WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Recently, in the House of Commons, Mr. Price asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he has any confirmation of the report that during the first seven months of 1896, out of about twenty English officials in the colony of Sierra Leone, there were three deaths and five cases in which the officials had to be invalided home; whether officials have to serve fifteen months at Sierra Leone before obtaining leave, whereas in the Gold Coast Colony they have only to serve twelve months; and whether, seeing that Europeans are particularly subject to illness during the later months of their stay on the coast, the Colonial Office can see its way to making the rules as to leave in Sierra Leone the same as in the Gold Coast Colony.\n\nThe Right Hon.

The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact. It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.65, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of West Africa—Gold Mining—The Labour Question', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Now, first, as regards the climate and mode of living. With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.646, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True
923,"The success of British military campaigns in Africa heavily relied on comprehensive medical support, underscoring the critical role of health and hygiene in maintaining troop morale and addressing anticipated health challenges.","The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a nuanced view of the role of medical support in British military campaigns in Africa. The General History of Africa highlights revolutionary changes in medical technology, such as the use of quinine against malaria, which reduced European fear of Africa and facilitated their conquest of the continent.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.704, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956. In other words, university and technical education was not intro› duced into Africa until towards the end of the colonial era.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""However, even in the inter-war period, labelled by contemporaries as one of 'colonial peace', military activities still punctuated African affairs in a severe manner. The professed European desire to keep Africa as militarily neutralized as possible was in fact never realized. The French introduced a law of conscription in 1919 whereby an African contingent of 10000 was to be annually obtained; the British developed a Sudan Defence Force, uniquely staffed by Sudanese as well as by British officers, but primarily directed to imperial strategic needs in the Near East as well as in East Africa. The Force Publique of the Belgian Congo, exhibiting the qualities both of occupation army and police force, was frequently used during this era to quell resistance expressed in the form of syncretistic religious movements.$^{29}$ On the scale of open warfare, events can be easily measured. The Italian campaign to subdue Libya in the 1920s and the Spanish and French effort to resolve the Rïf war in Morocco in the same period are obvious. But they are surpassed in scope by the rapacious war undertaken by Mussolini against the Ethiopians, an event with which the period here under consideration was tragically closed.\nThis account of military developments in Africa in the inter-war period does not seriously impair the assertion that divergent intentions of European colonial method and practice are those which, in retrospect, seem the most significant. There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence. The configurations of a new political elite were slowly emerging, as lower-echelon clerks and appointed chiefs in various colonial services - but particularly the British - were learning to apply, if only modestly, Napoleon's imperative: 'careers open to talent'. Training schools, such as the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar, were undertaking the preparation of educators and administrators upon whom the colonial administration was more and more to depend.

In the whole of western Africa, it was only Dahomey that had a standing army with its unique female wing, the famous Amazons. In most cases, there was not a dichotomy between civilians and soldiers. Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army. These armies were originally created, most of them in the 1880s and 1890s, first for the conquest and occupation of Africa, then for the maintenance of colonial control, and, finally, for the prosecution of global wars and the suppression of independence movements in Africa. After the overthrow of the colonial rulers, these armies were not disbanded but were taken over by the new independent African rulers and they have turned out to be the most problematic of the products of colonialism since, as W. Gutteridge has admitted, the armed forces have 'operated in the longer term against the stability of the ex-colonies'.

It was stated that sailors from the three men-of-war which were lying off Cape Coast would garrison the forts at Cape Coast, Anamaboe, and Accra. But from a more perfect information I am able to state that Colonel Conran, although desirous of availing himself of the services of the Navy, is, nevertheless, greatly opposed to the forts being placed entirely in their hands, as was the case during last year's expedition. His reasons are perfectly in harmony with existing circumstances; for it cannot be supposed that the Navy on shore will take the same care and interest in preserving certain necessaries which will be required by the soldiers on their return from the campaign as soldiers themselves would do if left in the forts. The Colonel takes very great care of his men, and attends personally to the minutest detail of their comfort. Should, therefore, the necessity of the service require the landing of marines or sailors, it is supposed that an officer of superior rank in the Army will be detached from the camp to remain at Cape Coast Castle. Again, from the information which I have obtained from a source which is beyond a doubt, it is stated that the head of the Government here has received positive orders not to act on the offensive, but to dispose the troops in such a manner as to prevent any further invasion of the Protectorate by the Ashantees. There was a report lately circulated that the army of the King of Ashantee was on the move, and the disposition of our troops (the preliminary order of which, by the favour of a friend, I was able to forward you by last mail*), must reflect credit on the chief of the army at this command.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor has rendered every assistance in his power to the military. His well-known and well-grounded popularity has made the native chiefs contribute willingly to the Land Transport Corps, which, from all appearance, is now working admirably.

It is now only four months since the undertaking was commenced. The expedition left Liverpool on January 17th 1891, under extremely good auspices. Everything was fitted out to the satisfaction of those who were conducting the working on the West Coast. And it embraced a very important element. In a rather unhealthy climate it is important that we should have at the head an eminent medical man, and such a man we have in Dr. Kavanagh. But in addition to his medical capabilities he is eminently fitted for the position of commander. He is interested in the business, having lately visited the parts where we are now working. He is full of enthusiasm with regard to it, and believes it will be a complete success. In addition to Dr. Kavanagh, we obtained the services of a distinguished officer who has served all over the globe, and an excellent surveyor, whom we have supplied with the best instruments for the purpose of prospecting. Then we have obtained the services of a miner of thirty-three years' experience in all parts of the globe. He formerly worked in a neighbouring district to our concession, and he was then so much struck with what the alluvial soil produced, that he gave up working on the quartz, because he saw the alluvial would beat it. So convinced was he of gold being found in the alluvial deposits that he gave up a Government appointment, with the salary he was receiving for the chance of getting 1 per cent on the output of gold. The expedition arrived at Elmina on February 15, all well and in good health, and the stores, machinery, &c., were landed most successfully.

So much the better, no doubt; but it is too soon to assert, as some people are doing, that the whole affair was projected and carried out with the perfection of wisdom. As a matter of fact the efficiency of Sir Francis Scott's column has only been subjected to a partial test. It performed, indeed, a creditable march under very trying conditions; and the Medical Staff deserves the highest praise for the way in which it went through its share in the programme. On the other hand, we are by no means prepared to admit that the Ashanti expedition of 1896 is to be regarded as the model for any future operation of a similar kind. The details in the plan of campaign are precisely those which have not been tested by experience. It cannot be argued that the experiment of drafting men from a dozen different corps, and putting them under the command not of regimental but of staff officers, is a signal instance of the sagacity and prescience of the War Office.

The health question is, therefore, the all-important one. We have shown how deeply we felt this by our letters to the Colonial and War Offices, and to the Admiralty, on the subject. We fear these letters have been unavailing. Great parade has been made, from time to time, of the medical stores shipped at Woolwich, but we have never yet observed anything to indicate, much less to establish as a fact, that Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline has found any, much less that very important place it should have occupied among them. Castor oil is no doubt a most useful medicine, and one that cannot be dispensed with; but for the battle with African fever we should have preferred to see that thousands of dozens of Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline had been sent out, instead of thousands of pounds of castor oil. The great object in view ought undoubtedly to have been that the European troops dispatched to the Gold Coast should, on their arrival, be in full and secure condition as regards health, for an immediate forward march on Kumasi. From the evidence forwarded to us in the first instance by his Excellency Governor Hill, then of Sierra Leone, and that subsequently gathered from civilian experience, it seems clear that there ought to be, on the part of every man intended for active service in West Africa, an antecedent use, as well as a free subsequent use, of fever medicines, among which Lamplough\'s Saline and Quinine are entitled to the first place. We, therefore, recommended that the officers and men embarked should have Pyretic Saline and Quinine daily administered to them during the whole of their voyage out, by which means they would enter the fever zone with blood so prepared against the action of the fever causes which there prevail as to prevent these producing those results which too often attend a visit to the West Coast of Africa. It is, alas! an indisputable fact that Europeans have invariably the malarious fever enemy—either common or African fever, or yellow fever—to contend with on that Coast, even as they have the ""jungle fever"" to contend with in certain districts in the East Indies. The battle with this insidious and destructive enemy must be fought, there is no alternative; and the sooner the campaign is opened against it by the man who invades its favourite haunts, the greater chance he will have of achieving a victory over it. If he wait until the fever attack him, he may conquer, but the chances are heavy against him; and even if he conquer, it will not be without great sacrifice of vital energy; whereas if he prepare against the attack, the chances will be ninety-nine to one in his favour as regards the preservation of his life, and of his powers for active service; at least for a period, so long as this Ashanti Expedition could possibly last. We fear that the 23rd, the Rifles, the ""Black Watch,"" and other troops and officers who have been sent out, have not had the advantage we desired for them; that the superior official wisdom which presides over their destinies as soldiers, has decreed that they must await the attack of fever before beginning the war against it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Medical Remarks re the African Climate and the Ashanti War', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The *Medical Times and Gazette* says: ""The first batch of invalids resulting from the \'little war\' forced upon us by the King of Ashanti have just reached this country in the Himalaya, and have been transferred to Haslar Hospital.

The head-quarters of the 2nd West India Regiment were only disembarked at Cape Coast on July 11 last; but although from the nature of their constant duties in the tropics, they might have been expected to be somewhat acclimatized; they speedily began to suffer from the prevailing forms of fever and dysentery. Many of the officers were attacked; the colonel of the regiment has come home in the Himalaya invalided, and the adjutant died a few days before the news left.\n\nA correspondent writes to the *Pall Mall Gazette*: ""The invalids from the West Coast of Africa state that dysentery and fever were engendered by the supply of bad water and defective salt provisions.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

Officers there are consequently more seldom affected by the malaria in the low land. Still further in the interior, Leicester Mountain stands in great prominence, above 2,000 feet above the sea's level, possessing a fine table land on its summit, and an agreeable and pleasant view all round. Beyond this is the Sugar Loaf, a mountain from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, and second to none in Western Africa, except that at Cameroons and Fernando Po. It commands a most extensive view towards the sea, and the most picturesque scenery that could be viewed, at least in Western Africa. Far above the miasma of the valley and plains, it is pointed out by nature as the sanitarium from the injurious influences of the low lands, and it only requires the ingenuity of man to make it habitable. Winterbottom, Aitkin, and Clarke, have all spoken of the healthiness of the mountains of Sierra Leone, but without effect; in former years periodical visits were made to it, and its value as the most healthy spot in Sierra Leone—and, in fact, in that portion of Western Africa situated between the Gambia and Lagos—was much appreciated by military and naval officers.\n\nAs a committee of the House of Commons will soon meet to consider all matters relative to the government of Western Africa, I hope, my Lord, you will urge the necessity of a good military sanitarium on the Sugar Loaf Mountain at Sierra Leone, and a station at Leicester Mountain.\n\nHow invaluable it would have been had the poor sick soldiers who were engaged in the Ashantee expedition had a sanitarium to go to.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

Our scheme will, we hope, alleviate much suffering and save valuable lives.\n\nIt is a modest one. A site is given facing the sea, and the building is to cost about £500.

This reliance on European remedies is evident in the use of quinine, arsenical compounds, and the development of vaccines and drugs from the 1920s onwards. The text also notes the inadequacy and uneven distribution of medical services for Africans, contrasting sharply with the resources available to Europeans, thus reflecting a colonial approach that prioritized European health needs. In contrast, The African Times articles specifically detail the promotion of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline, emphasizing endorsements by European officials and medical professionals, such as the Governor of Sierra Leone and Dr. Gibbon, for its efficacy in treating diseases like African Fever, Yellow Fever, and Smallpox. The articles highlight the distribution network targeting colonial regions and omit any mention of indigenous medical practices, underscoring the focus on European interventions.

The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.749, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Means of control and administration', 'content': ""Yet this was not what the European colonial administrators actually intended. Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez.

In general practice, these purposes were added to the functions of local rule and were fulfilled in three ways: redirection of systems of justice, use of forced labour, and the imposition of personal taxes. The latter two were the most disturbing of colonial institutions while the former was, perhaps, the most wisely reviewed of all by the Europeans.\nThe introduction of European judicial institutions was usually done with some attention to African customary law and to Muslim law where it also existed, as for instance, in Italian Somaliland; but the effects were modificatory none the less.

Missionaries therefore enthusiastically encouraged European intervention as a morally justified undertaking, especially from the 1870s onwards."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The imposition of European colonial rule on Africa was not merely the forceful establishment of European political, economic and social power on colonial possessions.

As he wrote in his Dual Mandate, the 'tax ... is, in a sense, the basis of the whole system, since it supplies the means to pay the Emir and all his officials'.$^{26}$ The institution through which the process worked was the 'native treasury', an idea originating with Sir Charles Temple, in service under Lugard in Northern Nigeria. Each native authority was to be returned a percentage of the taxes collected in his district. This amount was to form part of a 'native treasury' further enriched by various licensing fees and fines collected in the courts. From this sum, the emir or chief was to draw his own revenue and supply the salary of his subordinates. The remaining funds were to be used for public services and improvements. The arrangement, originally employed in the emirates, spread with indirect rule, not only to British possessions on both coasts but also to the Belgian Congo.\nOf all the colonial devices, the tax system was the one which most obviously encouraged the bureaucratic development of colonial rule. It assigned a common function to the administrator and the African chief who in assessing and collecting the tax, often in conjunction with local councils of elders or notables, reminded everyone of the regulatory power of the new system.$^{27}$ Furthermore after tax collectors as such, there soon appeared administrative agents who became part of the new colonial elite. The most striking and controversial among them were no doubt the akidas used by the Germans in East Africa. Swahili-speaking officials who served on the coast before European domination, they were used in redefined posi› tions both to collect taxes and to recruit labour for the German administra› tion. In 1936, special African clerks were appointed to collect taxes in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), another indication of this bureaucratic trend."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 334, 'article_title': 'Advertisements', 'full_section_title': 'Advertisements', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_02_1864', 'content': '## LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.\n\nEffervescing and tasteless, its constant use is especially calculated to maintain health and prevent Small-pox, Fevers, and Measles.\n\nHer Majesty\'s representative, the Governor of Sierra Leone, in a letter of request for an additional supply, states, ""It is of great value; it should be in the hands of all Europeans visiting the tropics.""\n\nIs an agreeable effervescing remedy, of great efficacy in all kinds of Fever and Blood diseases, especially these occurring during hot weather.

This was, indeed, a triumph of patient scientific observation and experiment by a man, happily, of more than ordinary talent. So delighted and so thankful was the King of Denmark, that he bestowed upon the man who had thus, under God, been the means of preserving the lives of his subjects, an estate of no inconsiderable value. On his return to England, where he spent the latter portion of his valuable life in ease and comfort, respected and beloved, he confided the preparation of this invaluable saline combination to Mr. Lamplough, under whose careful manipulation it has obtained a wide-spread celebrity. But why was it not in such quantities at Savannah as to have controlled the plague? For the same reason that it has not been found in such quantities in other places where the Yellow Fever has suddenly appeared—for the same reason that it was not found and used sufficiently in Western Africa during the last outbreak, and that will prevent its being found and used there in sufficient quantities when the next one shall occur. Again we ask, why this? And thus we are brought at once face to face with the evils that result from the wide-spread publication of falsehoods. So many remedies are day by day advertised (we never admitted them to our columns), each one of perhaps a hundred of which is said to be infallible for the cure of every possible disease ""that flesh is heir to,"" that a bewildered public knows not where to choose, and thousands upon thousands fall victims who might have been spared to life and family and friends had they been able to distinguish the true from the false. Strongly, however, as we felt this when we read the accounts sent from Savannah, we should not have made any remarks on it in our columns, but that we have now the dread of this fell disease making its visit to the Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, with its usual attendant, the virulent Small-pox among the natives. Feeling as we do, it is our duty to warn all to be prepared. There is a family resemblance between the Small-pox and the Yellow Fever, and the same remedy, Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline, has been triumphant with both. An account appeared in one of the Liverpool papers last spring of a vessel on which the Yellow Fever broke out at sea. The captain, it is said, had nothing on board that he could administer but Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline. There were four men down with the Fever; he persevered in giving these the Pyretic Saline, and they all recovered. We believe he administered it at the same time to others as a preventive. There are so many places on the West Coast where medical advice and assistance cannot be obtained, that it is all-important people there should have at hand a proved remedy to which they can immediately resort. Where a competent doctor can be found, there can be little doubt he will treat both Yellow Fever and Small-pox with the Saline if he happen to have any, because its efficacy with both these diseases, as with the analogous Jungle Fever of the East Indies, has now become well known to medical men. We were glad to see, in the late admirable work of Dr. Horton, Surgeon-Major, now stationed at Cape Coast Castle, entitled ""Diseases of Tropical Climates,"" that the Doctor frequently recommends the use of it; and Dr. Horton\'s talent and long experience with tropical diseases entitle him to be regarded as an authority in such matters. We have little more to say. This paper is written under a strong sense of duty. We have now done our duty to our friends on the Coast; it rests with them as to whether they will do the duty they owe to themselves and to those about them. We have stated our apprehensions, and we have not hesitated to take upon us the responsibility of stating our firm conviction that there is an efficacious preventive and remedy to which those who are so situate that they cannot hope to obtain immediate competent medical assistance in case of attack, ought to secure access, by providing themselves with it by anticipation; and we think we scarcely need to state that our only motive in giving this advice is to be found in our anxiety that not one life should be lost that might by any possibility be preserved.'}, {'id': 3367, 'article_title': ""Lamplough's Pyretic Saline"", 'full_section_title': ""Lamplough's Pyretic Saline"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1877#article-20', 'issue_date': '01_08_1877', 'content': 'It is a great thing to be able to cure disease; it is a still greater thing to be able to prevent it; but how much greater to be able to do both—to prevent and to cure. Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline does both. It is therefore a public benefactor. As such we regard every attack upon it, or upon the interests of its manufacturer in it, as a matter concerning ourselves. We are sorry, therefore, to see accounts of protracted litigation respecting it. The Board of Inland Revenue wish to impose patent medicine stamp duties on the Pyretic, although many years ago they very properly decided that it should be classed among the saline and aërated drinks, and was not, therefore, subject to duty. Mr. Lamplough, it seems, maintains, and we maintain, that this decision was a right and proper one. The way in which it was introduced to our notice, as we have often before stated, bears strongly on this point. Colonel, now General Hill, then Governor of Sierra Leone, called our special attention to it, not as a medicine, but as an agreeable and valuable beverage, the frequent use of which so influenced the blood as to diminish the liability to fever in tropical countries, and make the attacks of fever so slight when they did come that medical men would find but little difficulty in curing them. Almost all saline aërated waters are similarly beneficial, though in a very minor degree. But the difference is only in degree, not in kind, and does not constitute a liability to any revenue duties which are not levied on the others. It would be a manifest injustice to attach a penalty to superiority and say, ""Because you are so much more beneficial in your effects than other aërated drinks, we will tax you."" We feel very strongly on the subject, also because by affixing a stamp duty to the Pyretic Saline (the Revenue officers having decided that if applied at all, it will be applied to all Pyretic Saline exported, as well as to what may be sold in England) the Stamp Office will be taxing the Colonies, the people of India, who use it as a preventive of jungle fever, and consumers all over the world; for all over the world it is known, used, and appreciated. We contend that it ought not to be taxed in England, and, with tenfold reason, that no tax ought to be imposed on its use in Africa, the East and West Indies, &c., where abundant drinks of this nature are really indispensable to a healthy state of existence. The taxing it there is an application of that old vicious principle of taxation which lost us the American Colonies; and where opinions differ so much on the subject, even when all the talent which the Crown can employ is directed to the establishment of its liability to duty, we do think it is in the nature of oppression for the Board of Revenue to subject a meritorious individual, who has done so much to alleviate human woes, to the enormous expense of protracted litigation. Mr. Lamplough naturally objected to pay that which the Board of Inland Revenue themselves had formerly said he was not to pay. They bring their action; the jury cannot agree, and the case is referred. The Court of Appeal to which it is taken is divided in opinion. The Lord Chief Justice pronounces in favour of Mr. Lamplough, but the two junior Judges against him. The Board persist in their claim to impose duty; the matter has therefore to be carried to a higher Court. The entire public, both here, in West Africa, the East and West Indies, and in many other countries, is interested in it. It is only the thin end of the wedge that the Revenue authorities are trying to insert. If they succeed with Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline, we do not see how they can avoid carrying out their principle by attacking the manufacturers of aërated drinks, seidlitz powders, and a host of other useful beverages. It is not a matter of any personal importance, we should think, to Mr. Lamplough, because, of course, he will raise the price of the Saline to the extent of the stamp duty imposed. He is fighting the battle of the community at large in this and other lands, and we hope he will win it for them. If he does, no one will, we are sure, rejoice more than our West African friends, and those exposed to yellow and jungle fevers in the East and West Indies, who now regard it in its true character, as an almost infallible antidote, by predisposing the blood to resist the poison of miasmatic malaria, as well as an efficient co-operator with the experienced medical man in promoting a cure should the disease be really taken.'}, {'id': 4672, 'article_title': ""Lamplough's Pyretic Saline"", 'full_section_title': ""Lamplough's Pyretic Saline"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-11', 'issue_date': '01_08_1883', 'content': 'We are experiencing a certain amount of disturbance through the reports of destroying epidemics, and the precautions which those reports necessarily induce. The cholera (Asiatic or other), which has been causing so many deaths in Damietta, Cairo, and other towns and districts of Egypt, has caused also considerable inquietude throughout Europe, and called anew into being those quarantine laws an exaggerated enforcement of which produces no small amount of individual suffering, without corresponding general advantage. While the cholera (Asiatic or other) is making its ravages in Egypt, and creating a panic in Mediterranean countries, the old enemy of the tropics, the yellow fever, has been equally fatal at Vera Cruz, and other portions of the coast, in the Gulf of Mexico; and we cannot forget that on former occasions, when this dreaded malady has been thus prevalent on the Mexican Gulf shores, it has also made its destructive visit to some of the countries of the West Coast of Africa. Whether this has been through contagion by contact, or through analogous conditions of climate, seems to be uncertain. But be it which it may, the fact of the epidemic being in vigour at Vera Cruz draws our thoughts at once to Bathurst and Sierra Leone, in the former of which places the state of the drains, burial-grounds, &c., is such as to offer special invitation to yellow fever, or any other destructive malady. It is not in our power, nor within our province, to put an end to such atrocious and suicidal neglect, which has been so often exposed and animadverted upon in our columns; but we feel we should be wanting in our duty if we did not anew remind our readers of the peculiar and wonderful efficacy of **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.** It is now some twenty years since, at the instance of General (then Colonel) Hill, who vouched for its wonderful efficacy and preservative powers, as [experienced by himself during his residence in West Africa as Governor at Sierra Leone, the West Coast, through our columns, became acquainted with it, and its merits were widely acknowledged. The **African Times** was then the only journal of and for the West Coast, and it refused to advertise any other medicine; and even **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** was not advertised without full inquiry into its merits beyond the experience of Governor Hill. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the facts elicited in that inquiry. Its discovery was owing to researches and experiments made by Dr. Stevens in the Danish West India Island of St. Thomas. There had been most severe epidemics of yellow fever in the island; the mortality was something like seventy out of every hundred attacked. Dr. Stevens, not satisfied with the medical treatment under which the number of fatal cases was so appalling, entered upon a scientific study of the disease. He found, on examination, that in the blood taken from yellow fever patients whose attacks proved fatal, there were no globules; that the effect of the disease was to break down the globules in the blood, converting it into a thick fluid, no longer capable of sustaining life. He subjected this blood to a series of experiments, and at last succeeded by a combination of salts, &c., in reproducing globules in that blood. On this he based his treatment, and reduced the mortality during the next visit of the epidemic to less than 5 per cent. In recognition of services so eminent, His Majesty the King of Denmark bestowed on him a considerable estate, which he enjoyed until two or three years since, when he died of very advanced age at Cheltenham. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is the combination with which Dr. Stevens cured his yellow fever patients, and with which also he treated some 250 cholera patients in Coldbath-fields Prison, London, during the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1866. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is, therefore, not a mere agreeable effervescing aperient, as are, without exception, we believe, the numerous effervescing salines which have sprung into existence as imitations, being for the most part only carbonate of soda, Epsom salts, and tartaric acid, which latter, being prepared from ""argols,"" or the crystals deposited in wine vats, may, indeed, with propriety, be termed a fruit salt, but which as such has no property beyond that of impelling the carbonate of soda to effervescence. We have thought it right at this time, when yellow fever may be threatening the West Coast of Africa, and cholera be threatening England, to remind our readers of the essential difference between **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** and the host of effervescing imitations which have more or less succeeded in profiting by its fame, and thus getting into consumption. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC—DR. STEVENS\' COMPOUND**—exercises a direct and decided regenerating and revivifying action on the blood beyond the indirect action of the other aperient salines; and as we have done from time to time during the past twenty years, so again we recommend it to the daily use of our readers, whether on the West Coast of Africa or in England.'}, {'id': 4939, 'article_title': 'Markets', 'full_section_title': 'Markets', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1884#article-18', 'issue_date': '01_10_1884', 'content': 'Every medical practitioner justly extols the value of Salines.

The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence.

The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

The African Times articles provide details on proposals for sanitariums in these mountain regions, chosen for their perceived health benefits like higher altitudes and cooler climates, believed to be free from diseases prevalent in the lowlands. These articles also discuss the logistical challenges, such as the distance from military stations and difficulties in transporting sick personnel, and highlight the health benefits observed in similar locations like Fernando Po. Despite recommendations and the evident need for improved health facilities, the articles note a lack of action in establishing these sanitariums. In contrast, the General History of Africa focuses on the development of medical services and the impact of colonialism on health infrastructure, mentioning segregated living quarters and sanitary measures for European officials but not specifically addressing the use of mountain climates or the establishment of sanitariums. This absence of information in the textbook suggests a notable difference in coverage, indicating that while the idea was considered, it was not a prominent aspect of colonial health strategies as documented in the textbook.","The provided paragraphs from the General History of Africa textbook do not explicitly mention the establishment of sanitariums in African mountain regions such as the Cameroons, Sierra Leone, and the Abudi mountains.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized. In Nigeria, a dispensary was opened in Ibadan in 1904 and others followed in Yoruba towns in succeeding years.$^{81}$ By 191 o the Sierra Leonean government"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.054, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns. Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.627, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Ethiopia and Liberia, 1914-35: two independent African states in the colonial era', 'section_title': 'Economic and social change in Liberia and Ethiopia, 1915-35 > Ethiopia', 'content': 'the medical field, mainly by missionaries, notably the United Presbyterian Church of North America, the Seventh Adventist Mission, and the Italian Catholic Mission, all of which operated hospitals in Addis Ababa, while the Sudan Interior Mission ran a leprosarium at Akaki.$^{75}$ Other developments included the creation of a small civil service, partly formed with students returning from abroad, which received salaries instead of the revenues from fiefs, and the increasing replacement of tribute in kind by taxes in cash.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

Officers there are consequently more seldom affected by the malaria in the low land. Still further in the interior, Leicester Mountain stands in great prominence, above 2,000 feet above the sea's level, possessing a fine table land on its summit, and an agreeable and pleasant view all round.

Winterbottom, Aitkin, and Clarke, have all spoken of the healthiness of the mountains of Sierra Leone, but without effect; in former years periodical visits were made to it, and its value as the most healthy spot in Sierra Leone—and, in fact, in that portion of Western Africa situated between the Gambia and Lagos—was much appreciated by military and naval officers.\n\nAs a committee of the House of Commons will soon meet to consider all matters relative to the government of Western Africa, I hope, my Lord, you will urge the necessity of a good military sanitarium on the Sugar Loaf Mountain at Sierra Leone, and a station at Leicester Mountain.\n\nHow invaluable it would have been had the poor sick soldiers who were engaged in the Ashantee expedition had a sanitarium to go to.

Gigantic trees, with a dense undergrowth and profusion of moss on their stems and branches, are the chief characteristics of this damp jungle.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy.

The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So much has been said and written about the climate of West Africa, and it has been so long the fashion to abuse and condemn it without inquiry, that the medical profession, like the general public, have accepted and endorsed the common report as an established fact.

The distance between the town and the base of the mountains varies from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half, the intervening space being broken by numerous grass-clad undulations.\n\nHills ascend almost in regular gradation until they reach the highest peak, and as they are well wooded, the *coup d'œil* is striking and beautiful. A fairer situation for a town can scarcely be imagined, and if the sad experience of the past did not teach us the contrary, it would be pronounced healthy. There is no room to doubt, however, that Sierra Leone is extremely unhealthy, and epidemics of fever occur from time to time which sweep off large numbers of the population. This fever is peculiarly deadly to Europeans, and at the time when there was a European garrison the mortality was immense, whole families being occasionally carried off during one visitation. Happily, few Europeans are now sent to this deadly climate, and the number is yearly decreasing. At the census of 1881 there were only 160 resident whites in the whole of Sierra Leone.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Advertisements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Her Majesty\'s representative, the Governor of Sierra Leone, in a letter of request for an additional supply, states, ""It is of great value; it should be in the hands of all Europeans visiting the tropics.""\n1.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Her Majesty's Government have sent out Surgeon-Major A.

Meanwhile, The African Times articles emphasize the prevalence of malarious fevers and other diseases among British troops, particularly during the Ashanti Expedition, highlighting the need for preventive measures like Lamplough's Pyretic Saline and Quinine. The articles point out the inadequacy of medical supplies and the failure to prioritize effective fever medicines, leading to high mortality rates among soldiers. Correspondence with government officials and recommendations for military sanitariums and employing native African medical practitioners further underscore the influence of health challenges on colonial policies. Together, these sources illustrate that while military health challenges did shape some colonial policies, the scope of medical preparedness was largely limited to military needs, with broader health improvements for the African population remaining a secondary concern.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that are associated with the claim that British colonial policies in Africa were shaped by the military's health challenges, with leadership decisions on medical preparedness significantly impacting troop welfare.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905.

There is little doubt that colonial bureaucratiza› tion did provide partial preparation for an unintended movement towards national independence.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

Rather, all adult males, including even members of the ruling aristocracy, became soldiers in times of war and civilians in times of peace. Thus, one of the most novel institutions introduced by each colonial ruler was the professional army.

This was not easy to achieve as long as Europeans pursued national interests and African rulers could play off one power against another. Moreover, in the essential search for allies, Europeans had to use the supply of quality guns to bargain for treaties, concessions, neutrality or active participation in wars against rival African states. It therefore became essential to regulate their Scramble on the basis of international agreements and, in particular, to limit the supply of arms and ammunition. The most intense rivalry was between the British and the French. The British tried to secure their interests by also playing the role of protectors of Portuguese interests. This gave Bismarck the opportunity to play the role of an interested broker by convening an International Conference in Berlin. This Conference in turn gave King Leopold his chance to seek for international support for his ambitions on the Congo by proclaiming free trade and humanitarian antislavery ambitions.$^{24}$ This prepared the way for the Brussels Act which banned the supply of arms to African rulers in the name of an anti-slavery campaign.\nThe truth was that by linking the limitation of arms with the anti-slavery campaign, the British were able to exempt the 'self-governing' settlers in South Africa from the operations of the Brussels Act.

Convinced of the wondrous efficacy of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline, which was first brought under our notice by his Excellency Colonel Hill, then Governor of Sierra Leone, we have thought it our duty to bring the subject of its systematic use before Her Majesty's Government. Without intending to cast any reflection on the Army and Navy Medical Staff, we must express our conviction that there is something wrong in their system as regards malarious fevers. Were this not the case, we hold it to be impossible that the 101 Marines who arrived out about the 1st July should have been so affected by the climate as appeared in our report, last month, of the arrival of the shattered remnant of them in England, after only one month's service on the Coast. We have recommended to the War-office, with regard to troops, should they be sent out, and we recommend to all officers going out, that the systematic daily use of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline be commenced, with or without quinine, on the very day of their embarkation, so that the system may become saturated before they arrive out. Colonel Hill assured us that, by daily use of the Saline while at Sierra Leone, he was able to laugh at the African fever, though it had nine times attacked him; and we feel sure that if Sir Garnet Wolseley and the other officers recently sent out, as well as others still to be dispatched, will make daily use of the Saline, they will thank us by-and-bye for advising them to do so. It is of such great importance to prevent mortality and preserve health among the officers who must necessarily be employed, that we have not hesitated to step out of our path to call their particular attention to so invaluable a preventive and remedy.""}, {'id': 2642, 'article_title': 'The Health Question in the Ashanti Expedition', 'full_section_title': 'The Health Question in the Ashanti Expedition', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/31_12_1873#article-17', 'issue_date': '31_12_1873', 'content': 'It is universally admitted that the Ashanti Expedition will be successful or disastrous in proportion to the extent in which we can maintain life, health, and vigour among the officers and men employed. The health question is, therefore, the all-important one. We have shown how deeply we felt this by our letters to the Colonial and War Offices, and to the Admiralty, on the subject. We fear these letters have been unavailing. Great parade has been made, from time to time, of the medical stores shipped at Woolwich, but we have never yet observed anything to indicate, much less to establish as a fact, that Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline has found any, much less that very important place it should have occupied among them. Castor oil is no doubt a most useful medicine, and one that cannot be dispensed with; but for the battle with African fever we should have preferred to see that thousands of dozens of Lamplough\'s Pyretic Saline had been sent out, instead of thousands of pounds of castor oil. The great object in view ought undoubtedly to have been that the European troops dispatched to the Gold Coast should, on their arrival, be in full and secure condition as regards health, for an immediate forward march on Kumasi. From the evidence forwarded to us in the first instance by his Excellency Governor Hill, then of Sierra Leone, and that subsequently gathered from civilian experience, it seems clear that there ought to be, on the part of every man intended for active service in West Africa, an antecedent use, as well as a free subsequent use, of fever medicines, among which Lamplough\'s Saline and Quinine are entitled to the first place. We, therefore, recommended that the officers and men embarked should have Pyretic Saline and Quinine daily administered to them during the whole of their voyage out, by which means they would enter the fever zone with blood so prepared against the action of the fever causes which there prevail as to prevent these producing those results which too often attend a visit to the West Coast of Africa. It is, alas! an indisputable fact that Europeans have invariably the malarious fever enemy—either common or African fever, or yellow fever—to contend with on that Coast, even as they have the ""jungle fever"" to contend with in certain districts in the East Indies. The battle with this insidious and destructive enemy must be fought, there is no alternative; and the sooner the campaign is opened against it by the man who invades its favourite haunts, the greater chance he will have of achieving a victory over it. If he wait until the fever attack him, he may conquer, but the chances are heavy against him; and even if he conquer, it will not be without great sacrifice of vital energy; whereas if he prepare against the attack, the chances will be ninety-nine to one in his favour as regards the preservation of his life, and of his powers for active service; at least for a period, so long as this Ashanti Expedition could possibly last. We fear that the 23rd, the Rifles, the ""Black Watch,"" and other troops and officers who have been sent out, have not had the advantage we desired for them; that the superior official wisdom which presides over their destinies as soldiers, has decreed that they must await the attack of fever before beginning the war against it.

It might be worth while for officers to provide themselves with a small respirator, to be worn when exposed to the night air.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.734, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is evident, therefore, that the best military sanitarium is that which is situated, more or less, in the centre of the military stations on the Coast.

Officers there are consequently more seldom affected by the malaria in the low land. Still further in the interior, Leicester Mountain stands in great prominence, above 2,000 feet above the sea's level, possessing a fine table land on its summit, and an agreeable and pleasant view all round. Beyond this is the Sugar Loaf, a mountain from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, and second to none in Western Africa, except that at Cameroons and Fernando Po. It commands a most extensive view towards the sea, and the most picturesque scenery that could be viewed, at least in Western Africa. Far above the miasma of the valley and plains, it is pointed out by nature as the sanitarium from the injurious influences of the low lands, and it only requires the ingenuity of man to make it habitable. Winterbottom, Aitkin, and Clarke, have all spoken of the healthiness of the mountains of Sierra Leone, but without effect; in former years periodical visits were made to it, and its value as the most healthy spot in Sierra Leone—and, in fact, in that portion of Western Africa situated between the Gambia and Lagos—was much appreciated by military and naval officers.\n\nAs a committee of the House of Commons will soon meet to consider all matters relative to the government of Western Africa, I hope, my Lord, you will urge the necessity of a good military sanitarium on the Sugar Loaf Mountain at Sierra Leone, and a station at Leicester Mountain.\n\nHow invaluable it would have been had the poor sick soldiers who were engaged in the Ashantee expedition had a sanitarium to go to.

No grounds that we can perceive can justify such a step in face of the facts we are about to detail, and which incontestably prove that European medical officers (and others), instead of shrinking from service in West Africa, on the contrary, prefer the West Africa stations to those of the West Indies; and not unfrequently volunteer for the Coast. Indeed, the substantial privileges they enjoy in West Africa, in the shape of every year's service being doubly reckoned, besides the advantages of private practice—a privilege from which they are debarred in the West Indies, by private practice there being in the hands of civil medical practitioners—are, we affirm, keenly appreciated by them. There is no difficulty in proving this assertion. Beginning at the Gambia, we find that the present principal medical officer has already served twice on the Gold Coast, preferring to remain at the Gambia, and getting his appointment as surgeon to one of the West India regiments cancelled. In the same way Mr. M'D., who had been stationed on the Gold Coast, and at the Gambia, had his request granted to be relieved of the surgeoncy of a West India regiment, to return to the Coast, and it is well known that the late Mr. Brien most reluctantly accepted the appointment of surgeon to the 2nd West India Regiment, stationed at Barbadoes, where he was cut off by yellow fever, after having served once at the Gambia, and twice on the Gold Coast. Again, three of the staff assistant-surgeons have been stationed, two of them once on the Gold Coast, and one twice at the Gambia. We moreover find that Mr. Robertson, the present Colonial Secretary at the Gambia, had previously been Colonial Surgeon from 1835 to 1849, and is still in the enjoyment of good health. His successor as Colonial Surgeon retired on a comfortable pension, after a service of ten years; and the gentleman at present holding that office has now held it some four or five years. The present judge at the Gambia also commenced his official career, in 1837, as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, and has lived there, with the exception of occasional visits to England, from that time until now, in the enjoyment of a fair share of health. If we turn to Sierra Leone, we find that the late Colonial Surgeon lived there from 1831 to 1854, and in that long period went only twice home. The present Colonial Surgeon, whose appointment dates from January, 1856, had previously served as Staff Assistant-Surgeon at the Gambia and Sierra Leone, and with the exception of a severe attack of fever during the prevalence of the epidemic, or yellow fever, in 1859, has enjoyed good health. His brother, at present Assistant Colonial Surgeon, has likewise been appointed some time, and we are glad to know that his salary has been increased from 200l. to 300l. per annum, and that he is not restricted as preceding assistant colonial surgeons at Sierra Leone were from private practice.

We believe that there would be no difficulty whatever in finding educated men of colour who would gladly accept these appointments. We therefore again strenuously advocate their being employed, not only because such a step would save the country the large sum of money which at present is annually expended in providing European medical officers with passages to and from the Coast, but because of its paramount importance in the saving of human life. For the fact has been established in the most satisfactory and conclusive manner, that the negro is exempt from attacks of yellow fever; and this is a fact which should never be forgotten, but ought to be constantly borne in mind.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.695, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Classified medical returns of the colonial hospitals, Sierra Leone, for thirteen years, are in the possession of the Statistical Society.

There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages. In 1894 half the total government revenue and 95 per cent of the customs duties of the Niger Coast Protectorate were derived from spirits; by 1894 the governmental income from this source totalled nearly £2 million.$^{46}$ Although the Brussels Act of 1892 tried unsuccessfully to limit the trade in the Congo (now Zaire), it was not successfully regulated in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.699, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'The growth of European interest', 'content': 'Traders moved back and forth between the coastal ports in search of the most favourable terms of trade, and according to the varying fortunes of the ports and the states whose economies came to depend increasingly on the coastal trade.\nThis flexibility in the composition and activities of the different categories of Europeans harmonized with a similar flexibility in the pre-existing local African situation characterized, as we have seen, more by a historically and culturally interlocking pattern and networks than by any rigidly structured differentiations. The movement of European traders, travellers and missionaries was dictated largely by the abolitionist movement.\nIt was realized that the slave trade could only be effectively stopped at the source of supply in the African interior. European exploration of the interior, illustrated in the area under study by the works of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, was aimed at collecting both scientific and intelligence information primarily for the use of the abolitionist movement. Missionaries normally followed or accom› panied the explorers for the same reason. Of course, the new trend was also influenced by the ambition of European traders to reach interior markets directly rather than continue to treat with the middlemen along the coast.\nAll these European activities had to reckon with the local African situation in which they operated. The European explorers, missionaries and traders were obliged to operate within the pre-existing transportation and communication systems, and the pattern of geographical and eth› nographical inter-relationships. Mungo Park met his death in a canoe accident on the Niger, an age-old traditional transportation system, on the rapids at a point near Busa in Borgu. In their search for the source of the Niger river Hugh Clapperton and the Landers used an ancient overland route that connected different sub-groups of the Yoruba and their Ajaspeaking neighbours. This route also linked Yorubaland with Borgu, Hausaland, Borno and beyond.

It is generally considered that communities that gradually take up agriculture and animal husbandry continue for a long time to show a low annual growth rate (between 0.05 and 0.10 per cent), which is fairly close to the known growth rate of hunting and food-gathering communities. On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent. Figures for a difficult natural environment like that of Africa are unknown: but they are no doubt not very far from this model. Spread over more than two centuries, an increase of this order in the growth rate would have had a considerable effect on the overall population of Central Africa. 6\nCompared with twentieth-century growth rates these figures admittedly seem low. The fact is that in early African communities the death rate remained high. For the nineteenth century the main causes of death are known, but it is impossible to determine the extent of each one's con› tribution to the total.\nFirst, there were historical factors, especially the slave trade and its attendant violence. While the manpower drain of the slave trade to America was sharply reduced as from the 1850s, the Swahili and Arab trade took over to the east and north of our area. Figures can be given of overall losses for the whole of Central Africa,$^{7}$ but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to give a geographical breakdown, especially as the continual movement of groups and individuals spread the impact of the slave trade far and wide.\nThere were also ecological and epidemiological factors. The nineteenth century certainly saw the beginnings of medical progress in Central Africa, such as better knowledge of endemic diseases, use of vaccination and more general use of quinine. But this progress remained confined to the circles visited by traders from Angola or the Swahili coast. By and large the changes were too limited to defeat the major endemic diseases or epidemic outbreaks. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""vanished populations along the tracks and river banks from which the people had fled.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Details of how most of these forces - especially those of military conquest, political conquest, consolidation and economic exploita› tion - penetrated Africa and gained a firm grip on her society have been given in other chapters of this volume. It remains to do the same briefly for urbanization and western education before passing on to an analysis of the social effects which all the forces working jointly produced.\nIn dealing with urbanization it is necessary to emphasize that this important force of change was not introduced into Africa by European rule. On the contrary it had been operating there - with all the opportunities it offered for occupational specialization, population aggregation, social mobility and so on - for centuries before the imposition of European colonialism. The coasts of North, East, West and Southern Africa, as well, for example, as inland areas such as the Sudanic belt and Yorubaland were all centres of ancient and continuing urban aggregation thanks to the catalytic impact of political consolidation and international trade. But it is undeniable that European rule gave urbanization in Africa a new impetus by strengthening those political and economic forces already working in that direction. The result was the rise of new urban centres in places, such as Igbo and Ibibio lands of Nigeria, which had not previously experienced urbanization, as well as the expansion of the old centres. This it did largely by creating improved means of communication, new political and administrative headquarters as well as new centres of trade, mineral and agricultural exploitation. In this regard it is noteworthy that between 1850 and 1950, for the continent the critical century of European contact and foreign rule, the annual growth rate of urban population of Africa was 3.9 per cent compared to the world average of 2.6 per cent. This throws much light on the growth rate of urbanization generally in colonial Africa.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.713, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WHAT CAN BE DONE IN AFRICA?', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""people, to a commercial development and success without parallel on the West Coast. We could not marvel, because, as described to us, it is a place under the tropics—a mere sandbank in the lagoon, opposite the River Ogun, rising very little above the water's edge—was overgrown in the unpeopled part with a rank vegetation, luxuriating and decaying in something very like a morass; and the inhabited portion was reeking with filthy and pestilential odours. And now, mark well, in this place, which had with justice obtained so deadly a reputation, only one European died during the last twelve months, out of about a hundred, while native deaths were also wonderfully diminished in number. This statement was made in a letter which we published last month, and which came to us from a source which justifies us in believing its statements. And to what is this happy change owing? Has Lagos turned out of the tropics, or been elevated by some natural convulsion so as to bring her into a more vigorous atmosphere; or has decaying vegetation ceased to produce pestilential miasma owing to some secative change, and from the same cause other filth become inoffensive? Nothing of the sort, of course. Lagos has had the good fortune to be under the administration of a man who did not like to see his fellow-creatures and countrymen die around him like rotten sheep—a man with energy of character, who was convinced that Lagos could be made habitable, and who steadily and persistently set about making her so. We have differed with Administrator Glover's policy on many occasions as regards the main land, with its energetic, cultivating, and trading people, and had occasionally to find fault with him in other respects, but we have never failed to give him a high meed of praise for his administrative abilities. He has not been a Roi fainéant, like most of the West African administrators, indifferent to the moral and social progress, the material improvement and commercial development of the settlement under his charge; but has honestly and patiently laboured to bring about changes, which, in some instances, grievously offended the native prejudices, but which were indispensable to the obtaining results such as we have been commenting upon. With the exception of Bathurst, Lagos was naturally one of the most unfavourable of spots for successful results to sanitary reforms, and yet see what has been accomplished. We are ashamed for British rule when we hear of continued insalubrity at Cape Coast, Accra, and other places under British authority on the Coast of Guinea. When shall we have administrators there who will form a proper estimate of the value of human life, and seek to preserve it by removing the causes of disease which prove so often fatal to it? Captain John Hawley Glover, R.N., Administrator of Lagos, has been really the first West African sanitary reformer with sound and comprehensive views, and knows how to act with conciliation as well as with persistent energy and firmness. All honour to him. He has made Lagos habitable, and now he is lighting, as well as striving to enlighten her. Street lamps in Lagos! Look at that, ye old slave-traders, who may still be brooding over past atrocities of your unholy traffic. Lamps in Lagos! We anticipate great results on the interior from Lagos example.

It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts. But it is more than likely that on elevated ground, say fifty miles up the country, on these coasts, like the station of the Swiss Mission, near Ackra, that men could reside in very decent health for much longer periods, provided they have good food—fresh food, not tinned.\n\nHalf the mortality in the towns of the Gold Coast is caused by want of proper sanitation. Where every native yard is a private cemetery, where in such yards cesspools, years old, are the rule, and the ground is saturated with sewage, where water has to be stored in tanks, and is bad—how can the towns be healthy, under a tropical sun? With any quantity of land in the neigh\n\nhood of such towns, there is no public cemetery for the natives. With the towns elevated above the sea, and washed by the surf of the Atlantic, there is no attempt at proper drainage, and the removal of sewage to the sea.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN CLIMATE', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Since that time Fernando Po has changed its deadly nature, as the coming chocolate and coffee planters will find.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.775, 'probability_score': 0.071, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'So furious has been the attempt to ""taboo"" or ""put down"" the West Coast of Africa because of its climate, that we have no option but to return to the subject.

Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

The population of Nairobi, founded in 1896 as a transit depot for the construction of the Uganda Railway, increased from a mere handful to 13145 in 1927 and to over 25000 by 1940. The population of Casablanca rose from 2026 in 1910 to 250000 in 1936; that of Accra in the Gold Coast from 17892 in 1901 to 135926 in 1948; that of Lagos from 74000 in 1914 to 230000 in 1950, that of Dakar from 19800 in 1916 to 92000 in 1936, and to 132000 in 1945; and finally that of Abidjan from only 800 in 1910 to 10 000 in 1914, and to 127000 by 1955. It is quite clear from these figures that this rapid growth of urban population in Africa took place after the First World War, and especially during the period 1919 and 1945, which has been described as the heyday of colonialism in Africa. Moreover, these towns grew so rapidly during this period simply because they were either the new capitals or administrative centres of the colonial regimes - for instance Abidjan, Niamey, Nairobi, Salisbury and Lusaka; or the new harbours, railway termini or crossroads such as Takoradi, Port Harcourt, Bamako and Bulawayo or the new mining and commercial centres such as Obuasi, Jos, Luluabourg, Kimberley and Johannesburg.\nThere was undoubtedly also an improvement in the quality of life par› ticularly for those living in the urban centres. This, as Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), was the product of the provision of hospitals, dispensaries, pipe-borne water, sanitary facilities, better housing and the abolition of such practices as domestic slavery by the colonial rulers as well as the increase in employment opportunities.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The first important beneficial social effect was the overall increase of the population of Africa during the colonial period by about 37.5%, as J. C. Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated. Completely new towns such as Abidjan in Ivory Coast, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, Port Harcourt and Enugu in Nigeria, Nairobi in Kenya, Salisbury (now Harare) in Southern Rhodesia, Lusaka in Northern Rhodesia and Luluabourg in the Kasai Province of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) came into existence.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.677, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A basis for the future', 'content': ""Finally, it is pertinent to ask whether these massive changes were largely or even entirely the result of the colonial penetration. Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The clashing forces of demographic change up to and beyond 1880', 'content': 'Much the same doubts could be cast on another of the trade goods, guns. It was firearms that made it possible for a relatively small number of people to control a greater number of slaves, as Arab and Ethiopian experience in East Africa demonstrated. In the longer run, those areas most advanced in commercialization first developed a commercial, admini› strative and civil infrastructure: port facilities, roads, trading premises, cash cropping and eventually schools and health facilities and possibly declining mortality levels. In West Africa there was a tendency for those areas most involved in the slave trade to be ahead in such development; some of the trading acumen of the Igbo and the Asante almost certainly developed during the time of the trade. In North Africa drainage, refuse collection and other sanitary measures were demonstrably under way by mid-century in certain Egyptian and Algerian cities, motivated largely by the desire to protect the new European populations but doubtless affecting the indigenous population as well.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.72, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Furthermore, though colonialism did introduce some social services as has been pointed out already, it must be emphasized that not only were these services grossly inadequate and unevenly distributed in each colony, but they were all by and large meant primarily for the benefit of the few white settlers and administrators, hence their concentration in the towns.

In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New political trends', 'content': 'In West Africa, two completely new states, the products of the humani› tarian, abolitionist and racist campaigns of the period, Sierra Leone and Liberia, were also formed in 1787 and 1820 respectively, while Libreville was founded in Equatorial Africa.

In this exercise, the Sierra Leoneans were undoubtedly much more successful than the Liberians, since the culture that they evolved was not simply an importation from elsewhere but rather a synthesis of African, Nova Scotian and British elements moulded by the environmental conditions of Freetown and its surrounding areas.$^{55}$ It was the products of this dynamic culture, the Creoles, who played such a decisive role in the missionary and intellectual revolutions in West Africa.

Whether this could be achieved or not depended entirely on African labour. Profits depended on moving goods and this meant human porterage in most of tropical Africa, for the tsetse fly often prevented the use of draught animals and the lack of roads or railways prevented powered and wheeled vehicles being used. In Middle Africa the most profitable produce was at first ivory which entailed huge quantities of labour for carrying tusks. With the development of the pneumatic bicycle tyre in the late 1880s and the pneumatic car tyre in the 1890s a huge demand for rubber was created, which could not be met for a generation by plantation rubber (the first Malayan plantation came into production in 1910).

'$^{7}$ But first two problematic issues should be noted. One is the birth rate, which is most unlikely ever to have been higher than its present level. It may have remained constant, as the evidence of the age structure recorded over fifty years by the censuses of the Gold Coast and Ghana suggest. '$^{8}$ On the other hand, improving health conditions may have reduced sterility and sub-fecundity, as has been suggested at least in the cases of Kenya and Mauritius.$^{19}$ If this has been the case, it is improbable that pre-modern fertility was less than 90 per cent of that now found and most unlikely that it was under 80 per cent. The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

It is associated with the names of Canning, Wilberforce, and Brougham; and Zachary Macaulay—father of the brilliant historian and mighty Whig—devoted his best exertions for its improvement and social advancement. It originally belonged to a company, and its first governor was General Perronet Thompson, the honest and unflinching Reformer. At this time it was called ""The White Man\'s Grave,"" from the insalubrity of the climate; and its revenues, in consequence of the fatal slave-trade, did not amount to more than 5,000l. per annum. The climate now ranks equally well with any of our West Indian settlements, and the revenue amounts to 100,000l. per annum. For the last four years considerable discontent has existed in the colony—a Whig Government having deprived the colonists of trial by jury in all civil actions. This step was not taken in consequence of any abuse of the great constitutional right upon the part of African jurors; but it was alleged that the power wielded by a coloured advocate of no ordinary pretensions created an undue spirit for litigation amongst the natives. Mr. Pope Hennessey, brought up in a constitutional school, no doubt will bring his senatorial experience to bear upon the subject. The colony boasts of a Legislative Council, twelve in number, principally composed of Government officials, and the Governor presides at their assemblies, where they pass laws which come under the designation of ""Ordinances."" No African has a seat at this council-board; and although the natives possess vast wealth (the whole retail trade of the colony being in their hands), the commission of the peace has not been given to any of them. Mr. Butt\'s ""Home Rule"" is at every considerable discount in this colony, but fortunately the negro is of a more passive nature than is the fiery Celt. The house and land-tax falls very heavily upon the natives, who complain that the money thus acquired is spent in idle pageant, whilst the education grant does not amount to 100l. per annum. Steps are just now being taken to establish savings banks in Freetown, in order to check the reckless and extravagant habits of the people, as well as to reclaim the waste land around, which is the prolific cause of malaria. Mr. Pope Hennessey, it will thus be seen, has a noble mission before him, and under his intellectual and benignant rule Africa may yet fulfil the splendid prophecy of Canning as to her certain, though comparatively tardy, civilisation.'}, {'id': 2269, 'article_title': 'Purification of the Air of Cape Coast Town, and a Supply of Good Drinking Water for the People', 'full_section_title': 'Purification of the Air of Cape Coast Town, and a Supply of Good Drinking Water for the People', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_07_1872#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_07_1872', 'content': 'shall set honestly, determinedly, and uncompromisingly about this work of purification.

As regards Lagos, Lord Ripon had decided to send out a competent engineer to devise an efficient scheme for the improvement of the sanitary condition of the town, and one of the first questions will be that of the water supply. It was agreed that this subject should be pressed upon the attention of the new Secretary.\n\nTHE LAGOS BAR.\n\nMessrs. John Holt & Co. directed the attention of the committee to the fact that, notwithstanding the correspondence with the Colonial Office at the end of 1893, on the subject of providing a suction pump hopper dredger, for operating upon the Lagos Bar, no improvement has been effected in the bar. Messrs. Holt stated there did not exist at Lagos any slipway for hauling up even small craft for the purpose of repairing, cleaning, &c. Mr. Alfred L. Jones said some improvement had recently been effected in the bar, and he advocated that, as the railway question had just been pressed, recommendations as to the further improvement of the bar should be postponed. It was, however, agreed that the Government should be asked to construct a gridiron, or slip, or floating dock at Lagos.\n\nDELAYED REPORTS ON THE WEST AFRICAN COLONIES.'}, {'id': 6760, 'article_title': 'THE GOVERNOR OF LAGOS IN LIVERPOOL.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GOVERNOR OF LAGOS IN LIVERPOOL.', 'last_edit_date': '09-10-1896', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1896#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_10_1896', 'content': 'His Excellency Sir Gilbert Carter, K.C.M.G., the Governor of Lagos, was present at an informal meeting of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce held on Thursday, Sept. 10. Mr. John Holt presided in the absence of Mr. Alfred L. Jones, and welcomed Sir Gilbert warmly as a model West African governor, full of energy and determination, and far-seeing enough to have at heart the interests of the merchants, on whom primarily the existence of the colony depended. Naturally there were many points on which the authorities of the colony and the merchants were not entirely of one accord; and the trade were greatly indebted to Sir Gilbert for allowing them the opportunity of placing before him their views on many matters coming under his jurisdiction.\n\nThe chief subjects discussed were the recent increase of spirit duties, and the question of drawback on spirit imported for transit and transit dues; the construction of the new railway, its progress, the route chosen, &c.; the construction of costly bridges at Lagos, concerning which the Chamber had been in correspondence last year with the Colonial Office; the practicability of dredging the Lagos Bar and Lagoon; the question of the hinterlands of Lagos, and the result on the trade of the colony from the blockade of Ilorin; the possibility of establishing colonies of Kroo boys at Lagos, similar to that of Sierra Leone; the very important question of the water supply, the sanitation of the colony, and its health; also many other subjects that suggested themselves. Several of those present gave their views of the subjects in which they were interested, the questions of spirit traffic and issues raised thereby, folded woven goods, and adulteration of produce calling for much discussion. Mr. Holt said great credit was due to Sir Gilbert for originating the trade in rubber, which in two or three years had risen to above a quarter of a million sterling in value.\n\nHis Excellency, whose remarks were received with close attention, touched on all the subjects which had been brought before his notice, and gave much interesting information. He described the rise of the rubber trade in the colony, which had a somewhat curious history.

We could not marvel, because, as described to us, it is a place under the tropics—a mere sandbank in the lagoon, opposite the River Ogun, rising very little above the water's edge—was overgrown in the unpeopled part with a rank vegetation, luxuriating and decaying in something very like a morass; and the inhabited portion was reeking with filthy and pestilential odours. And now, mark well, in this place, which had with justice obtained so deadly a reputation, only one European died during the last twelve months, out of about a hundred, while native deaths were also wonderfully diminished in number. This statement was made in a letter which we published last month, and which came to us from a source which justifies us in believing its statements. And to what is this happy change owing? Has Lagos turned out of the tropics, or been elevated by some natural convulsion so as to bring her into a more vigorous atmosphere; or has decaying vegetation ceased to produce pestilential miasma owing to some secative change, and from the same cause other filth become inoffensive? Nothing of the sort, of course. Lagos has had the good fortune to be under the administration of a man who did not like to see his fellow-creatures and countrymen die around him like rotten sheep—a man with energy of character, who was convinced that Lagos could be made habitable, and who steadily and persistently set about making her so. We have differed with Administrator Glover's policy on many occasions as regards the main land, with its energetic, cultivating, and trading people, and had occasionally to find fault with him in other respects, but we have never failed to give him a high meed of praise for his administrative abilities. He has not been a Roi fainéant, like most of the West African administrators, indifferent to the moral and social progress, the material improvement and commercial development of the settlement under his charge; but has honestly and patiently laboured to bring about changes, which, in some instances, grievously offended the native prejudices, but which were indispensable to the obtaining results such as we have been commenting upon. With the exception of Bathurst, Lagos was naturally one of the most unfavourable of spots for successful results to sanitary reforms, and yet see what has been accomplished. We are ashamed for British rule when we hear of continued insalubrity at Cape Coast, Accra, and other places under British authority on the Coast of Guinea. When shall we have administrators there who will form a proper estimate of the value of human life, and seek to preserve it by removing the causes of disease which prove so often fatal to it? Captain John Hawley Glover, R.N., Administrator of Lagos, has been really the first West African sanitary reformer with sound and comprehensive views, and knows how to act with conciliation as well as with persistent energy and firmness. All honour to him. He has made Lagos habitable, and now he is lighting, as well as striving to enlighten her. Street lamps in Lagos! Look at that, ye old slave-traders, who may still be brooding over past atrocities of your unholy traffic. Lamps in Lagos! We anticipate great results on the interior from Lagos example. This has been our cry from the very day that Lagos was annexed and became a British settlement. We said it was her mission to bring a reflection of European and Christian civilisation home to the very borders of the Egba and Yoruba countries. Civilisation is catching; and we now look forward with even more than former confidence to great and widespread results in those countries, which will undoubtedly become the richest, as they are by far the most enterprising, portion of native West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': '1870-01-24', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/24_01_1870#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sanitary Condition of Lagos, and Its Remedy', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The Governor of Lagos has transmitted to the Secretary of State a report by Mr. J. W. Rowland on the sanitary condition of that island. Mr. Rowland says: ""The island is alluvial, and, being in the tropics, could not be otherwise than malarious. The level of the ground water never retires far from the surface. In the driest season it is in some wells not six feet deep; in Olowogbowo, the most elevated part of the island, at this season water is found at a depth of twenty-one feet, and the average depth, as found by the measurement of Government wells erected only in the more elevated quarters, is thirteen feet. In the rains the water is close to the surface—in some places, indeed, above it. This is very favourable for the production of malaria. There was a large mortality amongst the European population in the town. This points out the urgency for sanitary works, as most of the deaths were due to malaria. The prevention, or at least the mitigation, of this evil should be the first subject to which attention is paid. That it is possible to eradicate malaria from its most favoured haunts has been repeatedly proved. To find a remedy it must first be known what are the conditions necessary and most favourable to its development. It is not necessary to know the nature of the malarial poison if its production can be prevented, or at least curtailed: the two chief conditions are subsoil moisture and a high temperature. It is in the tropics that these conditions predominate. To combat them it is necessary to drain the subsoil and lower the temperature of the surface. Nature supplies in vegetation a simple means of attaining these ends. Pittenkofer has calculated that an oak-tree which had 751,592 leaves had from May to October an evaporation equal to 212 inches, whilst the rainfall over an area equal to that covered by the tree was only 25.6 inches, so that the evaporation was 8.3 times the rainfall. The eucalyptus in Algeria has been calculated to evaporate twelve times the rainfall. The water for evaporation is supplied from the subsoil by the roots, which penetrate in all directions. Whilst getting rid of the water from the soil, the evaporation cools the air, and the shade afforded by the trees protects the soil from the direct rays of the sun. If we acknowledge the influence of high temperature in producing malaria, the great advantage to be gained by sheltering the soil from the direct rays of the sun is evident, when we consider that when the temperature in the shade is 80°, in exposed parts it is nearly double. As a sandy soil has twice the capacity for retaining heat as humus, the disadvantage of having large unshaded sandy plains in the neighbourhood is evident. Such plains are hotbeds of malaria. These plains arise from the destruction of the forests, which is brought about partly for the purpose of supplying fuel, but mainly in order to clear the land for cultivation. The virgin soil, never particularly rich, is capable of producing crops for four or five years. The land is then deserted, and becomes overgrown with grass, which, being periodically burnt, prevents the re-growth of the forest. The exposed soil is impoverished by the heavy rainfall carrying away all the organic matter, so that further cultivation is impossible. This is notably the case about Accra, where the open plains radiate for about ten or twelve miles from the town. As a sanitary measure, it is suggested that the planting of quick-growing and shade-producing trees in the open spaces, in the compounds of houses, and the streets, should be proceeded with at once. All the streets should be shaded with trees, which should be planted so as to give the maximum shade with the minimum interference with the circulation of air. The eucalyptus has been largely used for this purpose, but it does not thrive in Lagos, owing, I think, to the poor sandy soil. One planted in the hospital compound in 1882 is now covered with flower buds, but the tree has not gained its reputed dimensions. There are many local trees that would answer our purpose better.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1888#article-1', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.688, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE MEAT-SUPPLY OF LAGOS', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'to provide, as far as possible, for the safety and security of human life, the introduction and enforcement of sanitary regulations should be a matter of primary concern with the Governors of the British West African Settlements. This is not a new contention of ours. Years and years ago we clamoured for a purification of the atmosphere of Sierra Leone; years and years ago, and notoriously at the time when Mr. Ussher was Administrator at Cape Coast, we called attention to, and stigmatized as it deserved, the abominably pestiferous condition of Cape Coast and Accra; using, if we remember rightly, the expression that the Chief British authorities were quite content to sit and lie upon a dunghill, so that they might indulge in their own particular enjoyments. To improve the atmosphere of the West Coast towns, by putting an end to those malarious effluvias that poison it, and make it deadly not only to the majority of Europeans, but, and especially at periods when small-pox and other epidemics are raging, to the natives themselves, ought to have been, as they have not been, among the earliest and most persistent efforts of civilized government. We believe something has been done of late in this direction; but we would have the sanitary screw put far more strongly on the populations than it has hitherto been; while at the same time the causes, other than human, of poisonous effluvia and miasma should be gradually removed. The evils which have been allowed to exist with regard to the meat-supply at Lagos come now for the first time under our notice; and we do not allow even one month to pass without thus pointedly calling the attention of the Acting Lieutenant-Governor and other superior officials there to so prolific a cause of the most fearful diseases and death, as the consumption by any classes of the population whatever of flesh in a state of poisonous putrefaction and decay. We feel sure it can only be necessary thus to bring the matter before the authorities to insure a stop being put to practices which must constantly threaten to engender some fearful epidemic that might sweep off the major portion of the population. If even in highly civilized European communities, such as those of Great Britain and France, it is found necessary to have inspectors always on the watch, to prevent the sale of diseased and decaying meat, fish, and other articles of human food, it cannot be regarded as at all surprising that in a place like Lagos, where the great mass of the population has not yet emerged from the filth of barbarism, some similar precautions should be indispensable. It is horrible to think of what is being eaten in Lagos, presuming as we do that we may rely on the account given by ""Sanitas."" We cannot credit for a moment that any of the civilized persons in the Lagos community are at any time consumers of the denounced abominations. Other education brings with it, in a greater or less degree, an education of the palate and the olfactory nerve also; and both nose and palate protest against the approach of what is necessarily disgusting to them. Civilization thus protects its children from many evils to which the uncivilized are exposed. But the civilized cannot with impunity look on with selfish indifference, while their less favoured brothers and sisters are exposed to perish, through want of that defending knowledge with which they themselves are blessed. It is a wise provision of nature that binds up the weal or woe of every individual more or less with that of the community to which he belongs. This acts as a great defence of the poor and ignorant; because not only feelings of humanity, which might be stifled, but the instinct of self-preservation operates in their behalf. We warn the civilized and educated in Lagos, and in every other settlement on the Coast in which any similar practices to those denounced at Lagos may unhappily prevail (if there be such), that for their own safety, if they be not influenced by any higher or more generous motive, they must, without delay, set about the work of putting an end to the horrible blood poisoning by means of deleterious food that is going on around them. And although the appetites of the poor wretched, ignorant creatures who, in their craving for animal food, thus banquet on disgusting garbage, may be so debased that they do not at first understand why they should be deprived of the abominations to which they have become habituated, they will, within a very short time, be brought by their own improved senses to comprehend that what had been done was done for their good. This will be a step gained by civilization among them—a primary lesson in their education—and can only be attended with generally beneficial results. We, moreover, quite agree with our correspondent that it will be an advantage gained by the whole community if stringent police restrictions on the killing and sale of flesh meat, other than poultry, should have the additional effect of leading to a discontinuance of the trade by females, except where they are recognized as merely acting as saleswomen of the flesh of animals killed legitimately, and while in a proper state of health, by their husband, or other male member of their family. Everything that tends in any, however small a degree, to elevate the condition of woman is a positive gain to the community. There is no true civilization without this advance of woman in the social scale. We have often thought this is not sufficiently in the minds of the educated natives on the West Coast. It is, however, so essential to civilized progress, that there is no real civilized progress without it; and every educated man should endeavour to discourage in all legitimate ways the employment of women in occupations involving great physical exertion, and should especially so respect his wife in the eyes and to the knowledge of the whole of the people among whom he lives, that his example may be to them a constant lesson in Christian civilization. The West Coast of Africa has advantages that no other countries emerging from barbarism ever enjoyed. Owing to the facilities of communication by steam, and the activity of an enterprising commerce, with weekly communication between it and the great centres of advanced European civilization, it is brought into immediate contact with every improving and ennobling influence that Christianity, learning, and science have gradually, and only during the tedious course of centuries, bestowed and developed. It comes into immediate contact with these in the full vigour of their maturity, benefiting by all the great intellects that have helped in the work of human enlightenment and progress. We are justified, then, in expecting from the educated in African communities under British inspection and rule, at the present day, a rate of advancement unexampled in the history of mankind. The hand of British Christian philanthropy has been liberally and unreservedly extended toward them (witness the efforts of the great missionary societies), and effected among them in a few years that which, if they had been left to their own unaided efforts, would have been the work of centuries, if even ever achieved. It is their bounden duty, then, as well as to their interest, to assist the British authorities in every possible way to cleanse the communities in which they live and have influence from all the filth and abominations of that debased barbarism out of which they have themselves been so happily extricated; and we expect from those of Lagos in this matter of disgusting and poisonous food, as well as from those of other towns in the matter of general cleanliness, an energetic assistance of the authorities, by hunting out and bringing to light, and helping to put an end to every lurking abomination of heathen ignorance, poverty, and barbarism.

The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Great Britain: Her Colonies and Settlements', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'introduction into at least the seats of government such as Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos, of such sanitary measures as would remove from them their tropical and uncivilized unhealthiness.

There is no blame lying at our door for this. Fifteen or more years ago we reproached one of the Governors as being satisfied to live on a dung-heap, if only he might follow his own vicious propensities; and the Governors may have become more moral, but they do not seem to have become more delicate. The public discussions in such a Colonial Representative Chamber sitting in London, as we have suggested, would soon lead to a change for the better in such important matters. There can be no reason why Accra, Cape Coast, Lagos, and other towns should not be made as healthy as Calcutta now is; Calcutta, than which no more fatally unhealthy place existed, when British rule was first established itself there.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

If we begin by looking at the chief towns of Algeria we see how the task was undertaken. Bona was so unhealthy in 1834 that whole regiments were swept away or invalided. Its death-rate is now stated to be the same as that of the more healthy towns of France. It is situated on a hill rising directly from the sea, and a plain extends from it towards the south at a very slight rise above the sea level, and with little of a natural outlet for drainage. This plain received the rainfall on its surface, together with all the water flowing down from the surrounding mountains, with which its deep, rich, vegetable soil was completely saturated. It was resolved to drain this plain, and the result was an immediate reduction in the sick and death-rate. Boufaric, again, was situated on a marsh, the soil of which was black, oozy, rotten, and saturated with water. A general system of drainage has turned this marsh into a dry, rich, and healthy soil, and malaria is unknown in the town. The drainage of the Lake Halloula has redeemed 34,000 acres of land, which is peculiarly favourable to the growth of the very finest cotton. The effect on the health of the neighbourhood has been such that the intermittent fevers, which were formerly of the worst type, have vanished, and the swarms of mosquitoes which once made life almost intolerable have gone with the fevers. Thus, the result of deep drainage and fertility has been permanently favourable to health, and the land which has been made to support life has shown itself grateful to its cultivators.', 'last_edit_date': '1867-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1867#article-26', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in Central Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'Early localized resistance against colonial rule and capitalism', 'content': ""Unlike pre-colonial resistance, the major aim of which was to maintain independence, resistance by peasants and workers during the early twentieth century was directly motivated by the efforts of the colonial regimes to reinforce their hegemony and impose capitalist relationships designed to exploit the human and natural resources of Central Africa.

Towards this end they removed a substantial number of unco› operative 'traditional' rulers, thereby violating the religious and cultural sanctity of kingship. To reinforce their tenuous rule, they dispatched African police, drawn from the ranks of mercenaries and allies, to oversee the activities of 'colonial chiefs' and to intimidate the local population.

In the Congo, Africans were compelled to collect rubber and to work on the railways and in the mines, while in Mozambique a variety of multi-national concessionary companies were the principal beneficiaries of the forced labour. Other Mozambicans were exported to Southern Rhodesia, South Africa and Sao TomØ. In Sao TomØ, on the cocoa plantations, they were joined by thousands of Angolans. Although the details differed, this pattern of coercion and intimidation was repeated in recruiting Africans to work on the European plantations of Nyasaland and subsequently in the mines of Northern Rhodesia. 32 The peasants who remained at home were not exempted from conscrip› tion. Many members of the rural population were required by law to provide several weeks of free labour on public works projects or face immediate imprisonment.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them.

It is a crying shame upon the Government to allow matters to come to such a miserable condition; and as the head of affairs here either cannot or will not remedy the grievances, we can only hope that some influential friend of this Colony will take the subject in hand and obtain for us through the Colonial Office in England what we are unable to obtain here—help for suffering humanity. — *Gold Coast Times.*"", 'last_edit_date': '1882-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1882#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Cholera at Bathurst—Fearful Ravages', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is with deep emotion that we have read the accounts sent to us by the bi-monthly mail from the River Gambia.

Out of the small population of Bathurst no less than 1,100 had already fallen victims to this fearful malady, which the African constitution, unaided, seems to have no power to resist. In the majority of cases death ensues within five or six hours. There seems to be one universal voice of condemnation as regards the official conduct of the Administrator. If ever there was an occasion when public revenue derived from Customs' duties (as they are here) ought to be unsparingly applied to arrest the progress of disease and alleviate the sufferings of a people, surely this was one; but although we see by the estimates that this small colony can afford, or is made to afford, nearly 10,000l. a year in official salaries, the Administrator, if he has not entirely sealed up the colonial chest against the demands of suffering humanity, has at least only allowed assistance in such driblets, and in so inefficient a manner, that no small share of the frightful mortality is charged openly against him by all classes of persons in the colony, from the European merchant down to the meanest native. Experience everywhere, as Admiral Patey must have well known, has established the efficacy of preventive measures in arresting the course of Asiatic cholera, provided those measures are of the right kind, and are vigorously and unsparingly applied; but little or nothing, so far as we can learn, seems to have been done by him to prevent the invasion and spread of this disease at Bathurst. The culpable parsimony and inefficiency of one man have thus brought disease and a horrible death into the homes of hundreds. Hitherto we do not hear that any European has died in Bathurst of this fell disease, but many were suffering under premonitory symptoms. The medical men in the colony (Dr. Jeans and Waters) seem to be doing their duty; we were prepared to expect this by their straightforward conduct in the Gordon case, which has no doubt brought down upon them the official ire.

If our readers have really paid attention to our Cape Coast and Gold Coast records during the last twelve months, the necessity of a change of system must have forced itself on their convictions.

It is a disgrace to Great Britain that they should have been for so long a time conducted in the way we have found it our painful duty, more than once, to expose.

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa. We are aware that against the appointment of native medical gentlemen the argument is constantly advanced, that neither Europeans nor Africans have confidence in them. This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it. And if evidence were wanting of its utter groundlessness, we could, in support of our statement, triumphantly point to the late Staff Surgeon William Fergusson, a dark mulatto gentleman (afterwards Governor of Sierra Leone), in whose medical skill both Europeans and natives had unbounded confidence. To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them."", 'last_edit_date': '1863-06-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""Review of Dr. Horton's Pamphlet"", 'section_title': '', 'content': 'c.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

This last gave as his opinion, ""that a few thousands spent at Cameroons or Fernando Po would, calculating only the market value of seamen\'s lives, repay themselves in as many years."" But the pros and cons of that lofty range as a sanitarium must be considered, and officers on the Coast should be consulted before the Home Government attempt to spend a large amount on it. There are many advantages in its favour, as may be seen described in the work of Captain Burton, on ""Abeokuta and the Cameroons,"" but there are also some great disadvantages attaching to it as a military sanitarium.\n\nIts distance from the different military stations on the Coast is one great objection, as it is situated about 400 miles below the last—viz., Lagos. It will be no great consolation for a sick officer—laid up, perhaps, with intractable fever, debility, diarrhœa, or dysentery, to be ordered, say, from the Gambia or Sierra Leone, to the Cameroons Mountains, a distance of about 2,000 miles, in a steam-packet, which is most uncomfortable, and unadapted for the conveyance of the sick during a voyage of eighteen days, in a direction quite opposite to the accustomed route—viz., to Teneriffe, Madeira, or England. The result would be found invariably to be that most of the cases, and certainly all the serious dysenteric cases, would succumb before the patient could reach the mountain of good hope. As a naval sanitarium it would be excellent, as it is in the neighbourhood of the rendezvous of the West African squadron, extending from the Volta to the Island of Ascension; and of the great oil rivers, to which so many English merchant vessels resort.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""DR.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs.

The General History of Africa highlights the inadequate and uneven distribution of health services, which primarily benefited European settlers and administrators, leaving the African population with minimal access to healthcare. For instance, in 1930s Nigeria, there were only fifty-two hospitals for over 40 million Africans compared to twelve hospitals for 4,000 Europeans. The text also notes that colonial powers reduced health expenditures during the 1930s depression, further limiting healthcare access for Africans. Economic interests were prioritized, as seen in the forced requisitioning of foodstuffs for export, leading to famines and weakened populations susceptible to epidemics like smallpox and Spanish influenza. Infrastructure development focused on economic purposes, such as railways, often disrupted local agriculture, contributing to food shortages and malnutrition. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight deplorable sanitary conditions in West African settlements like Bathurst, Cape Coast, and Lagos, where filth, stagnant water, and lack of proper drainage systems were prevalent, leading to outbreaks of diseases like yellow fever, smallpox, and cholera. The articles criticize colonial authorities for failing to implement effective sanitary measures despite having the financial means, as evidenced by the surplus in the Gambia Treasury. Economic interests were prioritized over public health, with sanitary improvements neglected in favor of maintaining economic activities like customs duties collection.

The most harmful step was the requisitioning of foodstuffs for the home country just when the troops (only 10 000 men in AEF, but a little over 160000 in AOF) were draining the countryside.\nIn Gabon, only a quarter of the compulsorily produced crops were left for local consumption. Even manioc (cassava) was exported from the Middle Congo and Oubangui-Chari: 210 tonnes in 1915 and 157 tonnes in 1917.$^{41}$ In AOF as a consequence of the decision to export local staple crops, the authorities emptied the reserve granaries which were already suffering from the succession of two years of semi-drought (1911-12) and one year of total aridity (1913). This drought had spread over the entire Sudan area, from Senegal to Wadai and Chad. From periodic shortages, the situation worsened to a devastating famine which claimed probably 250000 to 300000 victims,$^{42}$ alleviated only by the 4000 tonnes of cereals that the French Soudan (now Mali) had had neither the means nor the time to ship to France. 43 In AEF where forced sales continued into the following decade in order to provision the Congo-OcØan railway projects, famine, which had begun in 1918, spread to the northern half of the country (Woleu-Ntem) between 1922 and 1925; it probably reduced the Fang population by half, from 140000 to 65000 in 1933. 44 The weakened populations then fell a prey to epidemics: renewed out› breaks of smallpox and especially the spread of Spanish influenza imported from Europe, from which perhaps one-tenth of the population of AEF perished. 45 Though not always accompanied by such disastrous results, the famine problem resulting from food shortages caused by the colonial system was a recurrent feature of the period. It recurred, for example, in 1928-9 in Ruanda, the 'granary' of the Belgian Congo, following another drought, 46 and was indeed the sign of the fragility of countries exhausted by the Øconomie de traite despite the rise in export figures."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Exorbi› tant taxes (increasing in ten years from B.frs 1.25 to B.frs 7) encouraged the population to flee to the Gold Coast instead of raising crops. Forced labour was increased after 1927 by the installation of the administrative services at Niamey and by the extension of the railway. This completely disrupted the farm calendar though the precariousness of the rains made farming times particularly important. The supplies of millet, noncompulsory, depended entirely on the local chiefs. In 1931, the refusal of the administration to lower the head tax, and its insistence on collective payment, which forced the peasants to pay also for deserters and for deceased people, led to a situation in which, as one report put it, 'entire villages vanished ... and an age group was completely decimated'$^{47}$ with, in some areas, a mortality rate of over 50%."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The colonial economy of the former French, Belgian and Portuguese zones, 1914-35', 'section_title': ""The workers' burden > The crises and their repercussions > Food shortage, famine and epidemic"", 'content': ""Taken all round, however, the catastrophe was less spectacular. The famines were checked thanks to progress in transport facilities and the epidemics were halted by the first health campaign.

The purchasing power of the natives was reduced to a greater extent than in any of the earlier crises.' 48 It is revealing that, in Francophone Africa, large-scale urban immigration began precisely when the great crisis occurred. Notwithstanding the overall stagnation in population growth (in AOF 14.4 million inhabitants in 1931, as compared with 14.6 million in 1936), the towns and cities began to be swollen by the massive influx of destitute peasants, in spite of the fact that the urban employment situation was also critical. In 1936, for example, there were still no more than 167000 wage-earners in AOF, which was hardly more than 1% of the population. Nevertheless, between 1931 and 1936 the populations of Dakar and Abidjan increased by 71%, while that of Conakry doubled. Even more revealing is the case of an impoverished little town in the interior like Ouagadougou which, reversing its previous trend, increased its population by one-third over the same period. The overall stagnation in population growth during this period is parti› cularly indicative of the prevailing state of poverty. For social expenditure, was, by contrast, tending everywhere to rise: the parallel increase in ex› penditure on health care, and in the number of dispensaries and treatment facilities tended effectively to curb the traditional scourges (trypanoso› miasis, venereal diseases, leprosy). By contrast, populations proved to be particularly vulnerable during the taxing period 1931-6 to epidemics ('sporadic illnesses': influenza, smallpox, etc.). It is extremely tempting to relate such increased morbidity to the state of profound distress and physical destitution in which a weakened and defenceless population found itself. 49"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.68, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.711, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

Diseases common to the Indian Ocean communities, such as smallpox and cholera, but uncommon to the Central African interior, whose population lacked any natural immunity, had a devastating effect. Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades. African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought.

Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one.

In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past.

But the small-pox and other diseases which are found here arise from local causes; and an authorized person is also much necessary, who will adopt stringent measures with the people for the bringing about a purification of the district, which now promises to become an emporium of commerce in this section of the Gold Coast of Africa.'}, {'id': 3085, 'article_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': '03-29-1876', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'issue_date': '01_05_1876', 'content': '2. The want of proper sanitary measures is another reason why the climate of West Africa proves fatal to many European constitutions. When streets and yards, both back and front of houses, are made the receptacles of filth and excrement, of putrified remains of dead dogs, cats, and other animal and vegetable matter, is it to be wondered at that the miasma rising from these dung-heaps eventually becomes fatal to those constantly inhaling it. This is a cause which it would be well for the colonial authorities here to take into their serious consideration, as it is most certainly a preventible one. It was only in 1871, during the administration of Mr. J. Pope Hennessy, that the sanitary condition of Freetown seriously occupied the attention of the Government; but whether that gentleman’s plans have ever been efficiently carried out, and what effects they have hitherto had there, we have no means here to ascertain.\n\n3. The Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, unlike their countrymen in India, South America, and elsewhere, perhaps for the reasons I have already stated, are so careless of their personal comfort, and so intent upon accumulating as much money as they can, that they deny themselves every convenience necessary in a tropical climate. In Sierra Leone, for instance, they live in the town, which is at the sea-shore, instead of on the mountains, where they would enjoy the sea breezes equally as well, and be in a cooler and healthier atmosphere. In support of this view, I will only quote a passage which occurs in a paper read by Mr. Hennessy before the Society of Arts in April, 1873, in which he says: “The mountain district (of Sierra Leone), according to the Registrar-General’s Returns, appears to be as healthy as any part of England, or indeed as Madeira, the climate of which it closely resembles.”\n\nI hope I have clearly shown that the large mortality on the West Coast of Africa is not entirely due to climatic influences, and that a great deal could be done by the Government and the Europeans to counteract and mitigate those influences. As living proofs of what I have stated, I beg to point out Mr. Magnus Smith, Mr. A. Montagu, Mr. Marston, and half-a-dozen others, who have resided in Sierra Leone for fifteen or twenty years without meeting with the same fate as their countrymen, and simply because they have known how to live.—I am, dear Sir,'}, {'id': 3520, 'article_title': 'THE MEAT-SUPPLY OF LAGOS', 'full_section_title': 'THE MEAT-SUPPLY OF LAGOS', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1878#article-15', 'issue_date': '01_02_1878', 'content': '\n\nto provide, as far as possible, for the safety and security of human life, the introduction and enforcement of sanitary regulations should be a matter of primary concern with the Governors of the British West African Settlements. This is not a new contention of ours. Years and years ago we clamoured for a purification of the atmosphere of Sierra Leone; years and years ago, and notoriously at the time when Mr. Ussher was Administrator at Cape Coast, we called attention to, and stigmatized as it deserved, the abominably pestiferous condition of Cape Coast and Accra; using, if we remember rightly, the expression that the Chief British authorities were quite content to sit and lie upon a dunghill, so that they might indulge in their own particular enjoyments. To improve the atmosphere of the West Coast towns, by putting an end to those malarious effluvias that poison it, and make it deadly not only to the majority of Europeans, but, and especially at periods when small-pox and other epidemics are raging, to the natives themselves, ought to have been, as they have not been, among the earliest and most persistent efforts of civilized government. We believe something has been done of late in this direction; but we would have the sanitary screw put far more strongly on the populations than it has hitherto been; while at the same time the causes, other than human, of poisonous effluvia and miasma should be gradually removed. The evils which have been allowed to exist with regard to the meat-supply at Lagos come now for the first time under our notice; and we do not allow even one month to pass without thus pointedly calling the attention of the Acting Lieutenant-Governor and other superior officials there to so prolific a cause of the most fearful diseases and death, as the consumption by any classes of the population whatever of flesh in a state of poisonous putrefaction and decay. We feel sure it can only be necessary thus to bring the matter before the authorities to insure a stop being put to practices which must constantly threaten to engender some fearful epidemic that might sweep off the major portion of the population. If even in highly civilized European communities, such as those of Great Britain and France, it is found necessary to have inspectors always on the watch, to prevent the sale of diseased and decaying meat, fish, and other articles of human food, it cannot be regarded as at all surprising that in a place like Lagos, where the great mass of the population has not yet emerged from the filth of barbarism, some similar precautions should be indispensable. It is horrible to think of what is being eaten in Lagos, presuming as we do that we may rely on the account given by ""Sanitas."" We cannot credit for a moment that any of the civilized persons in the Lagos community are at any time consumers of the denounced abominations. Other education brings with it, in a greater or less degree, an education of the palate and the olfactory nerve also; and both nose and palate protest against the approach of what is necessarily disgusting to them. Civilization thus protects its children from many evils to which the uncivilized are exposed. But the civilized cannot with impunity look on with selfish indifference, while their less favoured brothers and sisters are exposed to perish, through want of that defending knowledge with which they themselves are blessed. It is a wise provision of nature that binds up the weal or woe of every individual more or less with that of the community to which he belongs. This acts as a great defence of the poor and ignorant; because not only feelings of humanity, which might be stifled, but the instinct of self-preservation operates in their behalf. We warn the civilized and educated in Lagos, and in every other settlement on the Coast in which any similar practices to those denounced at Lagos may unhappily prevail (if there be such), that for their own safety, if they be not influenced by any higher or more generous motive, they must, without delay, set about the work of putting an end to the horrible blood poisoning by means of deleterious food that is going on around them. And although the appetites of the poor wretched, ignorant creatures who, in their craving for animal food, thus banquet on disgusting garbage, may be so debased that they do not at first understand why they should be deprived of the abominations to which they have become habituated, they will, within a very short time, be brought by their own improved senses to comprehend that what had been done was done for their good. This will be a step gained by civilization among them—a primary lesson in their education—and can only be attended with generally beneficial results. We, moreover, quite agree with our correspondent that it will be an advantage gained by the whole community if stringent police restrictions on the killing and sale of flesh meat, other than poultry, should have the additional effect of leading to a discontinuance of the trade by females, except where they are recognized as merely acting as saleswomen of the flesh of animals killed legitimately, and while in a proper state of health, by their husband, or other male member of their family. Everything that tends in any, however small a degree, to elevate the condition of woman is a positive gain to the community. There is no true civilization without this advance of woman in the social scale. We have often thought this is not sufficiently in the minds of the educated natives on the West Coast. It is, however, so essential to civilized progress, that there is no real civilized progress without it; and every educated man should endeavour to discourage in all legitimate ways the employment of women in occupations involving great physical exertion, and should especially so respect his wife in the eyes and to the knowledge of the whole of the people among whom he lives, that his example may be to them a constant lesson in Christian civilization. The West Coast of Africa has advantages that no other countries emerging from barbarism ever enjoyed. Owing to the facilities of communication by steam, and the activity of an enterprising commerce, with weekly communication between it and the great centres of advanced European civilization, it is brought into immediate contact with every improving and ennobling influence that Christianity, learning, and science have gradually, and only during the tedious course of centuries, bestowed and developed. It comes into immediate contact with these in the full vigour of their maturity, benefiting by all the great intellects that have helped in the work of human enlightenment and progress. We are justified, then, in expecting from the educated in African communities under British inspection and rule, at the present day, a rate of advancement unexampled in the history of mankind. The hand of British Christian philanthropy has been liberally and unreservedly extended toward them (witness the efforts of the great missionary societies), and effected among them in a few years that which, if they had been left to their own unaided efforts, would have been the work of centuries, if even ever achieved. It is their bounden duty, then, as well as to their interest, to assist the British authorities in every possible way to cleanse the communities in which they live and have influence from all the filth and abominations of that debased barbarism out of which they have themselves been so happily extricated; and we expect from those of Lagos in this matter of disgusting and poisonous food, as well as from those of other towns in the matter of general cleanliness, an energetic assistance of the authorities, by hunting out and bringing to light, and helping to put an end to every lurking abomination of heathen ignorance, poverty, and barbarism. ""Sanitas"" has done his duty; let the authorities and educated people of Lagos do theirs.'}, {'id': 3649, 'article_title': 'THE OUTBREAK OF YELLOW FEVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE OUTBREAK OF YELLOW FEVER.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'issue_date': '02_09_1878', 'content': 'That fearful disease, Yellow Fever, is now deplorably prevalent in the south of the United States. We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and'}, {'id': 3699, 'article_title': 'WHAT SHOULD NOW BE DONE?', 'full_section_title': 'WHAT SHOULD NOW BE DONE?', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_01_1879', 'content': ""Threatening epidemics, with a stupid and criminal neglect of sanitary precautions, at the Gambia and Sierra Leone; a deplorable Gambia native war; the outrageous and unprovoked insult of Governor Rowe to the people of Sierra Leone, with the added injustice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the matter; the gross and shameful neglect of Sherbro', and the important mercantile interest there involved; the most condemnable apathy of the Gold Coast Government as regards public works indispensable for the development of the rich resources of the colony; the Awoonah troubles provoked by administrative incapacity and mismanagement; the insulting defiance of Dahomey; the tolerated abominations, depredations, and insults of Porto Novo, so deeply prejudicial to the interests of Lagos; and the absence of all true government in the latter, evidenced by the fact of the permitted existence of such a so-called police force as we brought under public and administrative notice in our last number!! Is it strange, or was it not rather inevitable, that so heavy a list of West Coast wrongs, grievances, and wants, pressing at one and the same time upon our notice, and craving our aid, should cause us to ponder with increased seriousness and zeal upon the actual position, with a view to some remedies that might possibly be efficient and effective? The result of our earnest thought is the conviction—a conviction which has strengthened with every day's reflections—that a representation of educated West Africa in London is the only and the indispensable means that can be effectively employed, for obtaining a redress of the wrongs, a removal of the grievances, and a supply of the wants now so keenly felt from Bathurst to Lagos. The social, the producing, and the mercantile interests all alike require this. But this cannot be obtained without a general, systematic, and faithful co-operation of the educated classes along the whole Coast. An annual provision of not less than from 300l. to 400l. would be absolutely necessary; a dependable provision to that amount, and not a spasmodic, uncertain one. We hesitated about making this, our conviction, known, because we feel that West Africa can have no other such representative than ourself. But we feel also that we should be wanting in our duty if we refrained from stating our conviction, merely because we are of necessity personally identified with it. Our long and arduous labours for West Africa, and our frequent, voluntary, unacknowledged representation of her people's wants, grievances, and interests here in London, with view to obtain the necessary interference of Her Majesty's Government, entitle us to write our mind on so important a matter fully and without any reserve. We have just now before us, while writing, detailed accounts from Accra and Quittah of the origin and progress of the Awoonah troubles, instigated, commenced, and continued by Captain Ellis in a way that cannot be too strongly reprobated; account of another infamous outrage in the Niger; and also of a trial for manslaughter at Cape Coast in which the sentence passed seems to call for revision by Her Majesty's Government, if the lives of men are to have any adequate protection by British laws, from the brutal violence of officials who fancy themselves to be so protected by the Government shield, that they may commit criminal acts on the defenceless with impunity. These reports are well calculated to strengthen us in our conviction and in our sense of duty, as above acknowledged. In conjunction with other wants, grievances, and wrongs, these show clearly that if the people of West Africa are to have a reasonable hope that they and their countries will make the progress they ought to make in good government, in recognized social position, in development of natural resources, and in financial and mercantile importance, they must be represented in London in the way above pointed out.\n**7**""}, {'id': 3710, 'article_title': 'Deplorable Mortality from Fever at Gambia', 'full_section_title': 'Deplorable Mortality from Fever at Gambia', 'last_edit_date': '12-26-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1879#article-3', 'issue_date': '01_02_1879', 'content': 'Sir,—The ""Angel of Death"" has been with us, paid us a long visit, exacted a heavy tribute of victims, and left his mark indelibly stamped on this unfortunate town.

A pestilential fever, against the threatened approaches of which no efforts at prevention were made by ignorant, incapable, and criminally erring officials, marched up from the foetid swamp, descended into the habitations of rich and poor, European and native; and death, terror, and dismay reigned supreme over all. The graphic letter on our 2nd page tells a little of the fatal tale. The Chief Magistrate, a young man in the full vigour and strength of life, four Europeans, and three natives, fell victims in one day. Well might the poor stricken people believe that this was only the vanguard of the Yellow Fever which had made its ravages at Senegal; and against the probable coming of which we had warned the besotted officials, who were too intent, each on his own little game, to heed our earnest entreaties to set their house in order. A heavy responsibility for the precious lives that have been taken away, should lie at the door of those whose duty it was to take adequate measures for the preservation of the public health. The large surplus which is the present boast of the Gambia Treasury—to create which the public service has in many ways been starved, and for creating which personal promotion is no doubt expected—is now made loathsome by the putrid corpses of victims whose lives have been sacrificed to it. Cynics and profound moralists equally affirm, that at the present time nothing is worshipped but money. The officials of Gambia and Sierra Leone may be adduced in support of the truth of this stigma. We earnestly hope the results will not be as fatal in the latter place as in the former. But when blundering, incapacity, and selfishness had done their worst, a kind Providence stepped in with its healthy Harmattan wind, and the pestilence gradually abated. We hope the influence of that health-giving wind will be felt at other parts of the Coast. Its absence last year was deeply deplored at Lagos, where small-pox and other fatal diseases then prevailed. But although the pestilence has been killed for a time at Bathurst by the Harmattan, we hope the present safety will not renew the guilty official apathy; and that the lives of the inhabitants will be deemed of more value than a few hundreds of pounds, more or less, in the Treasury. We say advisedly, guilty official apathy. Look at paragraphs in a letter from Bathurst in our last month\'s paper, page 2: ""The streets and drains are very dirty, the effluvia from the latter very bad; the native yards in a filthy state; and though we pay local rates of 400l. a year, and there is a surplus now in the Treasury of 6,000l., yet not a penny can or will be spared for sanitary measures, because Mr. Bauer"" (the Colonial Engineer) ""will not act;"" and yet we are face to face with a most sickly season; fever fast approaching to an epidemic in virulence; deaths are rapid and numerous, natives as well as Europeans. Still nothing is done!"" Our correspondent goes on to say that some months ago, ""We sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary, complaining of the inefficiency of the Engineer Department, asked for a Board of Inquiry, and engaged to substantiate all our charges. Dr. Gouldsbury"" (the Administrator, who is a most intimate friend of Mr. Bauer and his family) ""wrote to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, to the effect that our statements were false; our complaints personal feeling; that Mr. Bauer was a \'most zealous and efficient officer,\' &c. The Colonial Secretary wrote back to us to the effect that, in view of the Governor\'s report, he gave no credence to our statements, and would not grant any inquiry."" In other words, the memorialists of Bathurst had the lie given to them, in the same way that it was also given to those of Sierra Leone; in both cases upon the mere ipse dixit of the erring Governor. Alas! what a commentary on all this is the fearful mortality that has plunged Bathurst into wailing, lamentation, and woe; a mortality distinctly traceable to Engineering and Administrative favouritism and incapacity or heartless indifference. Do not these events furnish a startling proof of the necessity of combined action on the West Coast, that all the settlements and populations, European merchants as well as natives, should have our constant help to bring their wants and just complaints in such a way before Her Majesty\'s Government, that it shall not be in the power of erring officials, however high their grade, to call down Imperial insult on an injured people; and obstruct the course of reforms on which the lives of the inhabitants and the prosperity of the Settlement depend?'}, {'id': 3736, 'article_title': 'THE WAR IN THE RIVER.—THE LATE FEVER.', 'full_section_title': 'THE WAR IN THE RIVER.—THE LATE FEVER.', 'last_edit_date': '02-04-1879', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1879#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_03_1879', 'content': '## THE WAR IN THE RIVER.—THE LATE FEVER.\n\n### TO THE EDITOR OF THE AFRICAN TIMES.\n\nBathurst, R.G., February 4, 1879.\n\nSir,—The war in Baddiboo still goes on.

We have, as our readers well know, felt the most serious apprehensions that the yellow fever, which had visited Senegal, would descend to Bathurst, as offering a most tempting field for it to revel in. Happily, however, according to latest advices, it seems to have spent its energies at St. Louis, and has died out there. But we were not surprised to hear that while the yellow fever was at the Senegal, a virulent smallpox should have broken out among the natives at Bathurst, it having been almost invariably the case that whenever yellow fever made its appearance among the Europeans on that part of the Coast, there should be a great mortality from small-pox among the natives, who do not suffer from yellow fever, as neither do the Europeans from the native small-pox. In a letter from the Gambia which we insert in this present number, it will be seen that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed Sir Samuel Rowe to call at the Gambia on his passage down the West Coast, to inquire into the great neglect and abuses of which we have so often and so vehemently complained. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of the scare at Cape Coast, Sir Samuel will not have been able to make that visit and inquiry. We are very sorry that this is the case; but, nevertheless, we do venture to hope that the mere fact of such a visit and inquiry having been ordered by the Colonial Office will impel the authorities to make extraordinary efforts to set their house in sanitary order, and that we shall not have again to complain of a state of the burial-ground, the drains, and the general absence of sanitary regulations, such as we have had the painful duty so often to expose and comment upon. The strange neglect by British authorities in almost all the Coast towns of ordinary means to purify the atmosphere is a great disgrace to us as a nation. What has been done at Calcutta, in the East Indies, once as unhealthy a residence for Europeans as any one of the West Coast towns, might long ago have been done in these also. We would ask our readers to glance for a moment at the complaints about the state of Quittah, where a considerable revenue is already raised, and where a much larger one might, it is stated, be raised by a modified scale of Customs' duties, such as would put an end to the temptation of smuggling from the neighbouring sea-coast villages without British jurisdiction. Disgraceful is a word scarcely strong enough to apply to such a state of things. It is a lamentable fact that, so far as the Government is concerned, we do not carry civilization and civilizing efforts with us.

We have, as our readers well know, felt the most serious apprehensions that the yellow fever, which had visited Senegal, would descend to Bathurst, as offering a most tempting field for it to revel in. Happily, however, according to latest advices, it seems to have spent its energies at St. Louis, and has died out there. But we were not surprised to hear that while the yellow fever was at the Senegal, a virulent smallpox should have broken out among the natives at Bathurst, it having been almost invariably the case that whenever yellow fever made its appearance among the Europeans on that part of the Coast, there should be a great mortality from small-pox among the natives, who do not suffer from yellow fever, as neither do the Europeans from the native small-pox. In a letter from the Gambia which we insert in this present number, it will be seen that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed Sir Samuel Rowe to call at the Gambia on his passage down the West Coast, to inquire into the great neglect and abuses of which we have so often and so vehemently complained. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of the scare at Cape Coast, Sir Samuel will not have been able to make that visit and inquiry. We are very sorry that this is the case; but, nevertheless, we do venture to hope that the mere fact of such a visit and inquiry having been ordered by the Colonial Office will impel the authorities to make extraordinary efforts to set their house in sanitary order, and that we shall not have again to complain of a state of the burial-ground, the drains, and the general absence of sanitary regulations, such as we have had the painful duty so often to expose and comment upon. The strange neglect by British authorities in almost all the Coast towns of ordinary means to purify the atmosphere is a great disgrace to us as a nation. What has been done at Calcutta, in the East Indies, once as unhealthy a residence for Europeans as any one of the West Coast towns, might long ago have been done in these also. We would ask our readers to glance for a moment at the complaints about the state of Quittah, where a considerable revenue is already raised, and where a much larger one might, it is stated, be raised by a modified scale of Customs' duties, such as would put an end to the temptation of smuggling from the neighbouring sea-coast villages without British jurisdiction. Disgraceful is a word scarcely strong enough to apply to such a state of things. It is a lamentable fact that, so far as the Government is concerned, we do not carry civilization and civilizing efforts with us. Our officers are content to sit upon dung-heaps, surrounded by the most atmospheric-poisoning filth, to collect their Customs' duties; and then we complain of the fatal atmospheric impurities of so many of the sea-coast towns.

The professional journal reminds us that Aden and Mecca are the two points of the world the most adapted for the propagation of any disease. Almost all ships from the East stop at Aden on returning to Europe; while in respect to the Mahometans of Mecca, although few of them come to Europe, still they go almost everywhere else. Great care and inspection are therefore necessary. Happily, the International Sanitary Commission have directed their attention to the progress of the epidemic.\n\nTwo other epidemics continue to spread death around them. The first is the yellow fever in Senegal, where the number of victims has been great, but the Union Médicale says that terrible malady does not propagate in Western climates. The same thing, however, cannot be said of the second disease, diphtheria, which has killed more people in the south of Russia than any epidemic, not excepting the plague. It has prevailed there ever since 1872, and has never ceased to spread. In Bessarabia 15,000 out of 36,000 persons who were attacked have succumbed to it in the district of Pultawa. Out of 46,000 cases 19,000 ended fatally, and in Kharkoff, out of 29,000 cases there have been 17,000 deaths.

Dr. Taylor, of Sierra Leone, was offered the appointment and accepted it, and fulfilled his duties to the satisfaction of everyone. But a jealous feeling towards that gentleman, on the part of certain of the leading officials, caused an application to be sent to the Colonial Office to send out a doctor from England, and in due time Dr. W. Allan arrived here, and superseded Dr. Taylor, who afterwards left the Colony in disgust. Well, small-pox died away, and Bathurst became healthy; then the Senior Colonial Surgeon, Dr. Spilsbury, went to England on leave of absence, leaving Dr. Allan to perform his duties and look after his private practice (which is a lucrative one) among the European houses. Previous to Dr. Spilsbury going on leave, Captain Roche, the First Writer, or, as he is called here, ""the Governor\'s Secretary,"" went on leave; and for a time His Excellency managed to do without a ""Secretary."" But finding this inconvenient, he asked the Chief Clerk at Government House to undertake the duties; and he refused unless he was paid an extra salary—and quite right, too. The Governor then applied to Dr. Allan to take the post, and he accepted it. The consequence is that now his whole day is taken up with his quill-driving duties in the office in Government House, and he has little time to attend to his duties as medical officer; so his patients have to suffer. He tells his patients he has not got time to visit them; that ""If he got ten dollars a visit he could not come to them;"" that ""if he had them all at the Colonial Hospital he might manage to look after them"" (i.e., give the dispenser instructions, and leave him to do the best he could), ""but he cannot undertake to attend them properly now, as he is the greater part of the day at Government House.""

The cholera (Asiatic or other), which has been causing so many deaths in Damietta, Cairo, and other towns and districts of Egypt, has caused also considerable inquietude throughout Europe, and called anew into being those quarantine laws an exaggerated enforcement of which produces no small amount of individual suffering, without corresponding general advantage. While the cholera (Asiatic or other) is making its ravages in Egypt, and creating a panic in Mediterranean countries, the old enemy of the tropics, the yellow fever, has been equally fatal at Vera Cruz, and other portions of the coast, in the Gulf of Mexico; and we cannot forget that on former occasions, when this dreaded malady has been thus prevalent on the Mexican Gulf shores, it has also made its destructive visit to some of the countries of the West Coast of Africa. Whether this has been through contagion by contact, or through analogous conditions of climate, seems to be uncertain. But be it which it may, the fact of the epidemic being in vigour at Vera Cruz draws our thoughts at once to Bathurst and Sierra Leone, in the former of which places the state of the drains, burial-grounds, &c., is such as to offer special invitation to yellow fever, or any other destructive malady. It is not in our power, nor within our province, to put an end to such atrocious and suicidal neglect, which has been so often exposed and animadverted upon in our columns; but we feel we should be wanting in our duty if we did not anew remind our readers of the peculiar and wonderful efficacy of **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE.** It is now some twenty years since, at the instance of General (then Colonel) Hill, who vouched for its wonderful efficacy and preservative powers, as [experienced by himself during his residence in West Africa as Governor at Sierra Leone, the West Coast, through our columns, became acquainted with it, and its merits were widely acknowledged. The **African Times** was then the only journal of and for the West Coast, and it refused to advertise any other medicine; and even **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** was not advertised without full inquiry into its merits beyond the experience of Governor Hill. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the facts elicited in that inquiry. Its discovery was owing to researches and experiments made by Dr. Stevens in the Danish West India Island of St. Thomas. There had been most severe epidemics of yellow fever in the island; the mortality was something like seventy out of every hundred attacked. Dr. Stevens, not satisfied with the medical treatment under which the number of fatal cases was so appalling, entered upon a scientific study of the disease. He found, on examination, that in the blood taken from yellow fever patients whose attacks proved fatal, there were no globules; that the effect of the disease was to break down the globules in the blood, converting it into a thick fluid, no longer capable of sustaining life. He subjected this blood to a series of experiments, and at last succeeded by a combination of salts, &c., in reproducing globules in that blood. On this he based his treatment, and reduced the mortality during the next visit of the epidemic to less than 5 per cent. In recognition of services so eminent, His Majesty the King of Denmark bestowed on him a considerable estate, which he enjoyed until two or three years since, when he died of very advanced age at Cheltenham. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is the combination with which Dr. Stevens cured his yellow fever patients, and with which also he treated some 250 cholera patients in Coldbath-fields Prison, London, during the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1866. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** is, therefore, not a mere agreeable effervescing aperient, as are, without exception, we believe, the numerous effervescing salines which have sprung into existence as imitations, being for the most part only carbonate of soda, Epsom salts, and tartaric acid, which latter, being prepared from ""argols,"" or the crystals deposited in wine vats, may, indeed, with propriety, be termed a fruit salt, but which as such has no property beyond that of impelling the carbonate of soda to effervescence. We have thought it right at this time, when yellow fever may be threatening the West Coast of Africa, and cholera be threatening England, to remind our readers of the essential difference between **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC SALINE** and the host of effervescing imitations which have more or less succeeded in profiting by its fame, and thus getting into consumption. **LAMPLOUGH\'S PYRETIC—DR. STEVENS\' COMPOUND**—exercises a direct and decided regenerating and revivifying action on the blood beyond the indirect action of the other aperient salines; and as we have done from time to time during the past twenty years, so again we recommend it to the daily use of our readers, whether on the West Coast of Africa or in England.'}, {'id': 5276, 'article_title': 'THE GAMBIA BLUE BOOK.', 'full_section_title': 'THE GAMBIA BLUE BOOK.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1885#article-16', 'issue_date': '01_12_1885', 'content': '\n\nThe earthy matter which my specimen contained could be eliminated in the manufacture, the indigo dye would be worth more, and might, perhaps, rival Bengal. The Gambia Settlement is flanked on either side by countries exporting gum largely, and yet, odd as it may seem, this article has not so far ranked among the exports from this grand river. Although those interested commercially have endeavoured to convince me to the contrary, I have personally made it my business to look into the matter, and have succeeded in assuring myself, by specimen proof, of the local existence of the same gum as is exported annually by millions of pounds weight from the adjacent colony of Senegal. Indigenous in Fouta D\'jalon, which is laved by the Upper Gambia, is coffee, which, originally from that source, has now by dint of energy, speculation, and cultivation become an article of export from the rivers that lie between this colony and Sierra Leone; yet coffee has never been put thence on the market. Beniseed, corn, and rice might be luxuriantly grown and developed in an agricultural sense to a sufficiency not only for home consumption, but also for profitable export. The ""Gofio"" eating people of the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands present a near and fixed market for Indian corn, of which there might be obtained here two crops a year. There is much room both as to space and adaptability of soil for the extensive growth of the oil palm, the cocoanut palm, the castor oil, and cotton plants. The turqueira (physic) nut is to be found here—though not extensively, yet in luxuriant form. Much attention is now given to its growth in the adjoining Cape Verde Islands. Some years ago the Gambia was well represented in the European timber markets; it yet offers a field rich in its celebrated mahogany, rosewood, ebony, runs, &c. The last mentioned thrives better in water than out of it, and would answer for foundations of buildings in Holland. The local rubber industry began to develop in 1882, and by the extension of proper instructions in modes of collection, as also in the establishment of a proper knowledge of the value of the vines, so as to avoid their wholesale destruction, has room for much increase. Unfortunately here, as elsewhere in the collection of rubber, it is a regular case, I fear, of killing the goose for the golden egg. The value of the exports in this commodity in 1883 was £6,047, and in 1884, £23,213. For a local trade, especially in tomatoes—so largely consumed by the Wolofs of these parts—kitchen gardening might be promoted with considerable pecuniary advantage, much more so than is the case. Results have proved that cabbages, tomatoes, lettuce, beetroot, parsley, watercress, pumpkins, melons, pine apples, guavas, bananas, mangoes, even European strawberries, as fine as could be desired, may be grown here during certain months of the year. Under ""Mail Service"" I remarked upon the means existing for telegraphic communication with Europe. Direct telegraphic communication hence with Europe, either by means of the laying of a cable between Dakar and Bathurst, seventy or eighty miles, or by the extension of the Senegal land wire (fifty miles), or by the continuation of the cable European connexion with St. Vincent (270 or 280 miles), Cape Verde Islands; a more liberal and convenient mail service both with England and Sierra Leone; a lowering of the English freight tariff, so as to admit of more direct and full import of English goods; the lighting up of the sea approach and entry to the Gambia; a new Government wharf or landing stage, laid with tramways, of sufficient size to accommodate at one time two average-sized steamers for the centralization and expedition of the local import and export trade; rapid means of personal locomotion by tramcar to Cape St. Mary, the health resort of this capital, now more than ever that the Oyster Creek Bridge has been finished; reclamation of and filling in of swampy land adjoining Bathurst; a new Court House; extended gaol accommodation; road and street improvements; a public library, and an improved water-supply,—represent wants of much moment to the development of this settlement, which, it is to be hoped, may gradually come at no distant date within the sphere of practicable and visible improvements.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Fatal Epidemic at Senegal', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'By letters from Bathurst we are informed that the epidemic at Senegal is very terrible, the latest advices from thence reporting over 600 deaths.', 'last_edit_date': '1879-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1879#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa.

Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence.

The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics.

They call for coordinated reform and improved health measures, while acknowledging some efforts like appointing medical officers and vaccination attempts, though these are often seen as insufficient or hindered by bureaucracy.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.796, 'probability_score': 0.055, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s. From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university.

Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.733, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""However, the development which probably had the earliest impact on the mortality level was the penetration of the roads and railways. By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths.

Certainly the conditions of the work camps encouraged the spread of venereal disease and diarrhoea. The workers, carrying within themselves the great load of worms and agents of diseases commonly found in tropical Africa, worked more strenuously at times than they had learnt was possible for them, and came down with sickness.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.708, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns against epidemic disease apparently gained some success. The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction. More commonly, the competition for captive labour generated intense hostility among and within trading factions.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum. This is inconceivable over any protracted period; the latter population would be halving every forty years, and both situations suggest much larger populations during the earlier years of European contact than has ever been suggested.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Without doubt the upsetting of stable populations, leading in the Congo Free State and elsewhere in Middle Africa to an upsurge in the death rate, the slow reduction in mortality in other parts of the continent during the nineteenth century and generally in this century, and the accelerating nucleation of population in towns and on mining fields owed nearly everything to the industrial revolution and to increasing contact with people from industrial societies. Much of this process would have occurred even without colonial rule: the traders would have provoked trading centres into growth; European medical schools would have become interested in the problem of protecting the traders and others from tropical disease; missionaries would have laid the foundations of a hospital system.\nNevertheless, direct colonial rule certainly speeded up all these processes. Eventually, and certainly towards the end of our period, it helped to reduce the great peaks of mortality by increasingly and effectively importing and utilizing epidemic control technology and creating a modern transport system which could distribute food in areas of famine. The need for administrative centres provided a nucleus for new towns, and colonial administrations' guarantees of personal safety and investment security to the nationals of their metropolitan countries hastened the growth of com› mercial settlements, mining camps and plantations. Without colonial administrations European entrepreneurs might well have been even more rapacious and murderous than they were. Europeans usually justified the colonial penetration by pointing to these achievements. Yet the history of Latin America and China shows that in time most of these gains would have been achieved in any case; the growth of industrialization was irreversible and a modus vivendi with Africa and other developing areas, from which needed raw materials were secured, was essential."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned. There was also a loss of enthusiasm on the part of the French and the British colonial officials themselves, due to the emergent trend of conflict and friction between the European colonial elite and the locally produced western-educated Africans. In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent. There were two reasons for the trade: firstly that alcohol could be produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits; secondly, in economies without widely accepted mediums of exchange, there were real problems about what goods would be accepted in return for the produce of Africa.$^{43}$ Mary Kingsley found the trade spirit pure and likely to do less harm than cannabis,$^{44}$ a view shared by a committee that investigated the liquor trade in içoç.$^{45}$ Spirits were distributed on a huge scale, frequently as wages.

It is more difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to imagine that the level of disease (venereal disease and other infections) generated during this period still resulted in a high level of female sterility half a century or more afterwards. It is also difficult to feel that the situation in this region is adequately covered by a recent United Nations' publication writing of'cultural shock' and 'the processes of adjustment'. 71 Eventually the colonial penetration was to lead to a great increase in population.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.675, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 519, 'article_title': 'Vaccination', 'full_section_title': 'Vaccination', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-10', 'issue_date': '23_01_1865', 'content': 'The neglect of vaccination in our colonies has been remarked upon in late medical reports, and in the opening discourses of the lectures in the great London medical schools.

A pestilential fever, against the threatened approaches of which no efforts at prevention were made by ignorant, incapable, and criminally erring officials, marched up from the foetid swamp, descended into the habitations of rich and poor, European and native; and death, terror, and dismay reigned supreme over all. The graphic letter on our 2nd page tells a little of the fatal tale. The Chief Magistrate, a young man in the full vigour and strength of life, four Europeans, and three natives, fell victims in one day. Well might the poor stricken people believe that this was only the vanguard of the Yellow Fever which had made its ravages at Senegal; and against the probable coming of which we had warned the besotted officials, who were too intent, each on his own little game, to heed our earnest entreaties to set their house in order. A heavy responsibility for the precious lives that have been taken away, should lie at the door of those whose duty it was to take adequate measures for the preservation of the public health. The large surplus which is the present boast of the Gambia Treasury—to create which the public service has in many ways been starved, and for creating which personal promotion is no doubt expected—is now made loathsome by the putrid corpses of victims whose lives have been sacrificed to it. Cynics and profound moralists equally affirm, that at the present time nothing is worshipped but money. The officials of Gambia and Sierra Leone may be adduced in support of the truth of this stigma. We earnestly hope the results will not be as fatal in the latter place as in the former. But when blundering, incapacity, and selfishness had done their worst, a kind Providence stepped in with its healthy Harmattan wind, and the pestilence gradually abated. We hope the influence of that health-giving wind will be felt at other parts of the Coast. Its absence last year was deeply deplored at Lagos, where small-pox and other fatal diseases then prevailed. But although the pestilence has been killed for a time at Bathurst by the Harmattan, we hope the present safety will not renew the guilty official apathy; and that the lives of the inhabitants will be deemed of more value than a few hundreds of pounds, more or less, in the Treasury. We say advisedly, guilty official apathy. Look at paragraphs in a letter from Bathurst in our last month\'s paper, page 2: ""The streets and drains are very dirty, the effluvia from the latter very bad; the native yards in a filthy state; and though we pay local rates of 400l. a year, and there is a surplus now in the Treasury of 6,000l., yet not a penny can or will be spared for sanitary measures, because Mr. Bauer"" (the Colonial Engineer) ""will not act;"" and yet we are face to face with a most sickly season; fever fast approaching to an epidemic in virulence; deaths are rapid and numerous, natives as well as Europeans. Still nothing is done!"" Our correspondent goes on to say that some months ago, ""We sent a petition to the Colonial Secretary, complaining of the inefficiency of the Engineer Department, asked for a Board of Inquiry, and engaged to substantiate all our charges. Dr. Gouldsbury"" (the Administrator, who is a most intimate friend of Mr. Bauer and his family) ""wrote to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, to the effect that our statements were false; our complaints personal feeling; that Mr. Bauer was a \'most zealous and efficient officer,\' &c. The Colonial Secretary wrote back to us to the effect that, in view of the Governor\'s report, he gave no credence to our statements, and would not grant any inquiry."" In other words, the memorialists of Bathurst had the lie given to them, in the same way that it was also given to those of Sierra Leone; in both cases upon the mere ipse dixit of the erring Governor. Alas! what a commentary on all this is the fearful mortality that has plunged Bathurst into wailing, lamentation, and woe; a mortality distinctly traceable to Engineering and Administrative favouritism and incapacity or heartless indifference. Do not these events furnish a startling proof of the necessity of combined action on the West Coast, that all the settlements and populations, European merchants as well as natives, should have our constant help to bring their wants and just complaints in such a way before Her Majesty\'s Government, that it shall not be in the power of erring officials, however high their grade, to call down Imperial insult on an injured people; and obstruct the course of reforms on which the lives of the inhabitants and the prosperity of the Settlement depend?'}]","[{'document_title': 'The Menace of War by Ashanti', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""That virulent small-pox should be carrying off daily its ten or a dozen victims from among the small native population of Bathurst, or that any other fatal epidemic should be committing its ravages there, ought not to be a matter of surprise with any one who had read the accounts we have given from time to time, and very recently with added emphasis, of the infamous absence of all adequate sanitary regulations for making the place a safe habitation for human beings, whether white or black. We have, as our readers well know, felt the most serious apprehensions that the yellow fever, which had visited Senegal, would descend to Bathurst, as offering a most tempting field for it to revel in.

But we were not surprised to hear that while the yellow fever was at the Senegal, a virulent smallpox should have broken out among the natives at Bathurst, it having been almost invariably the case that whenever yellow fever made its appearance among the Europeans on that part of the Coast, there should be a great mortality from small-pox among the natives, who do not suffer from yellow fever, as neither do the Europeans from the native small-pox. In a letter from the Gambia which we insert in this present number, it will be seen that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed Sir Samuel Rowe to call at the Gambia on his passage down the West Coast, to inquire into the great neglect and abuses of which we have so often and so vehemently complained. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of the scare at Cape Coast, Sir Samuel will not have been able to make that visit and inquiry. We are very sorry that this is the case; but, nevertheless, we do venture to hope that the mere fact of such a visit and inquiry having been ordered by the Colonial Office will impel the authorities to make extraordinary efforts to set their house in sanitary order, and that we shall not have again to complain of a state of the burial-ground, the drains, and the general absence of sanitary regulations, such as we have had the painful duty so often to expose and comment upon. The strange neglect by British authorities in almost all the Coast towns of ordinary means to purify the atmosphere is a great disgrace to us as a nation. What has been done at Calcutta, in the East Indies, once as unhealthy a residence for Europeans as any one of the West Coast towns, might long ago have been done in these also. We would ask our readers to glance for a moment at the complaints about the state of Quittah, where a considerable revenue is already raised, and where a much larger one might, it is stated, be raised by a modified scale of Customs' duties, such as would put an end to the temptation of smuggling from the neighbouring sea-coast villages without British jurisdiction. Disgraceful is a word scarcely strong enough to apply to such a state of things. It is a lamentable fact that, so far as the Government is concerned, we do not carry civilization and civilizing efforts with us. Our officers are content to sit upon dung-heaps, surrounded by the most atmospheric-poisoning filth, to collect their Customs' duties; and then we complain of the fatal atmospheric impurities of so many of the sea-coast towns. Is it too much to hope that the new Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony will find some remedy for this fearful state of things? As a medical man, we hope that he will prove to be sensitive in this matter. We feel that he has Herculean tasks before him. His predecessors have done so little that there is overwhelming work for him to do, unless he be allowed to appoint subordinates whom he can imbue with his own spirit. We would venture to ask his Excellency's consideration of our Quittah letters. They are brief and plain, but to the point, and, we think, well worthy his attention, so soon as his settlement of the Ashanti episode and the important Lagos question referred to in our last will permit. Our support may not be of much importance, but, such as it is, it will be heartily given to him in every effort to make British rule a mighty civilizing agent and a real blessing to the Gold Coast countries and their people."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Virulent Small-pox at the Gambia, Quittah Impurities, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""That virulent small-pox should be carrying off daily its ten or a dozen victims from among the small native population of Bathurst, or that any other fatal epidemic should be committing its ravages there, ought not to be a matter of surprise with any one who had read the accounts we have given from time to time, and very recently with added emphasis, of the infamous absence of all adequate sanitary regulations for making the place a safe habitation for human beings, whether white or black.

We are very sorry that this is the case; but, nevertheless, we do venture to hope that the mere fact of such a visit and inquiry having been ordered by the Colonial Office will impel the authorities to make extraordinary efforts to set their house in sanitary order, and that we shall not have again to complain of a state of the burial-ground, the drains, and the general absence of sanitary regulations, such as we have had the painful duty so often to expose and comment upon. The strange neglect by British authorities in almost all the Coast towns of ordinary means to purify the atmosphere is a great disgrace to us as a nation. What has been done at Calcutta, in the East Indies, once as unhealthy a residence for Europeans as any one of the West Coast towns, might long ago have been done in these also. We would ask our readers to glance for a moment at the complaints about the state of Quittah, where a considerable revenue is already raised, and where a much larger one might, it is stated, be raised by a modified scale of Customs' duties, such as would put an end to the temptation of smuggling from the neighbouring sea-coast villages without British jurisdiction. Disgraceful is a word scarcely strong enough to apply to such a state of things. It is a lamentable fact that, so far as the Government is concerned, we do not carry civilization and civilizing efforts with us. Our officers are content to sit upon dung-heaps, surrounded by the most atmospheric-poisoning filth, to collect their Customs' duties; and then we complain of the fatal atmospheric impurities of so many of the sea-coast towns. Is it too much to hope that the new Governor-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony will find some remedy for this fearful state of things? As a medical man, we hope that he will prove to be sensitive in this matter. We feel that he has Herculean tasks before him. His predecessors have done so little that there is overwhelming work for him to do, unless he be allowed to appoint subordinates whom he can imbue with his own spirit. We would venture to ask his Excellency's consideration of our Quittah letters. They are brief and plain, but to the point, and, we think, well worthy his attention, so soon as his settlement of the Ashanti episode and the important Lagos question referred to in our last will permit. Our support may not be of much importance, but, such as it is, it will be heartily given to him in every effort to make British rule a mighty civilizing agent and a real blessing to the Gold Coast countries and their people."", 'last_edit_date': '1881-03-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1881#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.736, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SMALLPOX AT CAPE COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'WE deplore, though we are not surprised, that the loathsome epidemic, smallpox, is committing its ravages at Cape Coast.

A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people. In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past. The records of travellers and explorers establish incontestably that smallpox is the great fatal disease of Africa. Among the great and precious benefits which European civilisation bestows on Africa, let this be one, that we make the results of our own experience instrumental in saving African lives from that fell destroyer.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.74, 'probability_score': 0.069, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The African Royal Mail steamer Africa, which arrived at Liverpool on 6th February, reports that trade on the Coast was dull, but health, though the weather was remarkably hot, fairly good.

There is considerable sickness during and after the rains; but many of the merchants, finding that their business makes but light demands upon them during that season, are in the habit of passing in England the worst months of the year. Military officers who suffer in health to any considerable extent are at once invalided, and civil officers are afforded every facility for obtaining the advantages of a change of climate: thus not only are very few Europeans compelled to remain in the colony for any length of time without a change, but there is also a consequent diminution in the number of deaths from the effects of the climate.\n\nIt has often been urged that the unhealthiness of the Gambia is largely due to the unfavourable situation of Bathurst, the capital and seat of trade, on the low-lying and swampy Island of St. Mary, and it has been suggested that a great improvement would be effected in this respect by the removal of the seat of government to the more airy and elevated situation of Cape St. Mary.\n\nThere can be no question of the superior healthiness of the Cape, and on this account alone the transfer would be very desirable; but\n\nalthough the government offices might be removed there, it is certain that the merchants would not on this account alone consent to incur the heavy expense of moving their store-houses and long-established places of business from the safe anchorage and convenient landing-places of the river to the exposed situation of St. Mary, which is in no respect so well adapted for the purposes of trade. So long, therefore, as Bathurst remains the seat of trade, it is necessary for its convenience that the custom-house and other public offices connected with it should not be removed from its neighbourhood.\n\nOne cause of the unhealthiness of Bathurst is the existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of an offensive and pestilent swamp; but from a recent report of Major Clarke, R.E., it appears that, for the sum of about 7,000£, the whole space, covering nearly 1,000 acres, could be closely and efficiently drained.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable.

To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered.

At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities.

On the other hand, communities with a more diversified agriculture have a much higher annual growth rate, put between 0.10 and 0.15 per cent.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome.

This was partly due to the establishment of an economic base which is evidenced by many developments discussed in several of the chapters above. Some of the more spectacular of them were the develop› ment of palm-oil exports from the Niger delta, the discovery of diamonds and then gold in Southern Africa in the years from 1870 to 1900, the development of an indigenous cocoa-growing industry in the Gold Coast in the 1890s and the discovery of huge deposits of copper between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in the early years of the century."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dahomey, Yorubaland, Borgu and Benin in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Socio-economic change and institutional adaptation', 'content': ""The new changes resulted from a combination of factors, including the nineteenth-century wars which, as in Yorubaland, had the effect of ren› dering the coastal areas relatively safe and attractive to migration from the hinterlands in which most of the fighting took place; the sea-borne trade which was rendered permanent by the transition from slave to 'legitimate' trade, thereby conferring a definite economic advantage on the coastal regions; and the steady growth of European interest, which enlarged the traditional role of selected coastal towns such as Lagos, Porto Novo and eventually Cotonou to take on new and increasing responsibilities not only as ports but also as political capitals of emergent colonial states and their independent African successors.\nIn all these changes, however, the economic factor would appear to have been the most dominant, especially with reference to the European presence. Trade, above all, brought the European to Africa and has remained the most important consideration for his continued stay. The nineteenth century was especially critical because of the change in the established pattern brought about by the abolition of the export trade in slaves, which had dominated transactions for over three centuries. Known in European records of the pre-abolition era as 'the Slave Coast', this area of West Africa was among those most involved in the slave trade; and the relatively smooth transition to 'legitimate' trade must ultimately be credited to the adaptive capacity of the indigenous societies.\nIn this regard, there is, perhaps, no better illustration than the case of Dahomey, traditionally considered to be the most persistent slave-raiding and slave-trading state in West Africa. Although the British anti-slave trade squadron had succeeded in stamping out the overseas trade in slaves along the coast of Porto Novo by 1851, Whydah, the Dahomey port, did not really cease to export slaves until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.$^{40}$ This Dahomey indulgence turned the Aja coast, especially the stretch between the Werne and the Mono into favourable spots for the settlement of Portuguese (mostly Brazilian) slavers, who had been chased out of such ports as Lagos and Badagry where the British anti-slave trade measures took effect much earlier.

Again the degree of exposure to these outside influences determined the type and extent of resistance put up by various societies.\nApart from these human influences, there were ecological changes taking place in East Africa in the 1890s, which also affected response to foreign penetration. The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others. Pastoral societies, such as the Maasai of Kenya, seem to have been hit worst of all. A number of Maasai families such as the Waiyaki and Njonjo families took refuge among the neighbouring Gikuyu where they were to play a different role both in relation to their response to colonial advance and in relation to the colonial system that was conse› quently set up, as well as to the post-colonial society.$^{7}$ Others took refuge among the Nandi.$^{8}$ Still others were to offer their services as soldiers, first to King Mumia of Wanga among the Abaluyia as mercenaries, and, second, to British imperial agents as part of the expeditionary force that was used to conquer the country that is now called Kenya. This was especially the case against the Nandi.$^{9}$ The Maasai example serves to illustrate the kind of dislocation that had taken place among the economies of various societies in this general area. Thus, colonialism came to an area already suffering from an economic crisis with all its attendant effects.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Liberia and Ethiopia, 1880-1914: the survival of two African states', 'section_title': ""Economic and social developments and European intervention in Liberia's and Ethiopia's internal affairs, 1880-1914 > Ethiopia"", 'content': 'Like Liberia, Ethiopia underwent significant economic changes from the last decades of the nineteenth century on.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Sahara in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Desert trade and the nomads', 'content': 'Changes in European military technology accelerated in the latter half of the nineteenth century, with the result that European forces, armed with the latest weapons, faced opponents with outdated arms.

Trade with Europe had existed before, but the nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in the scale of this trade with varying effects depending on the structure of Saharan regional economies. For example, the cotton goods industry of Morocco, which had trans-Atlas outlets, succumbed after i860 to the competition of Manchester cotton goods, while the woollen textile industry of southern Tunisia fared much better and continued to feed products into trans-Saharan networks.$^{18}$ On the fringe of the Sahara various groups involved themselves in exports of primary products. For example north of the Senegal basin increased exports of gum arabic allowed a zawiya lineage, whose members specialized in Islamic scholarship and the mediation of disputes and organized trading caravans to escales on the Senegal river to gain in power and influence.19 In the area north of the Sokoto caliphate the rise ofexports ofostrich feathers and tanned goat skins in the last thirty years of the century forced nomadic ruling classes to adjust to the new¬ found ability of peasants and servile agriculturalists to earn income from collecting and selling these products.20 European economic penetration also affected the tastes of consumers, so that the custom of drinking heavily sugared tea spread during the century.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.048, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 531, 'article_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1865#article-0', 'issue_date': '23_02_1865', 'content': ""From Cape Palmas there is news of a disturbance between the Liberian Government and the natives, causing an entire stoppage of trade and all communication between the disputants.\n\nSierra Leone was tolerably healthy; trade flat.

We must earnestly call the attention of our Parliamentary friends to this important subject. The expenses of the West Coast squadron ought to be kept down to the lowest figure compatible with its efficiency, and no ship ought to be sent out to a fever climate that is not so constructed as to give the strongest possible guarantees for the preservation of the valuable health and lives of Her Majesty's sailors. We believe that the naval returns for 1866 will show a most unusual amount of death and sickness in the West Coast squadron, and feel convinced that the greater portion of those lamentable deaths and invalidings were owing to the employment of the Bristol.

We have given quotations from the advices daily received in England. It is not alone in the United States, however, that we hear of its ravages. The French Government having received an official report of its serious outbreak at Senegal, despatched immediately a medical reinforcement of six doctors, with adequate supplies of all kinds, to meet the dread emergency. The ravages committed by this malady during its former visits to the West Coast of Africa, when so large a proportion of the Europeans in some of the settlements fell victims to it; and the fearful outbreak of small-pox, of a peculiarly virulent character, among the natives, which attended it in its progress, were so painfully fresh in our memory, that we lost not a moment in calling the attention of Her Majesty\'s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies to the news received, and the measures adopted by the French Government; and soliciting that additional medical aid, with abundant supplies of vaccine lymph, should be also despatched by Her Majesty\'s Government to the West Coast settlements. We have since received an assurance from the Colonial Office that some immediate measures would be taken. We cannot, however, conceal our deep anxiety as regards that dreaded visitant. When it last made its appearance at Bathurst, it carried off its victims with extreme rapidity; and its subsequent progress southward was of an equally distressing character; while the records in our Journal of the heart-rending scenes witnessed by Dr. Horton when on his vaccination tour through the Anamaboe district, attest how deeply the native population must be interested in the matter. Our fear is, that with the cessation of the rains, the Yellow Fever will travel southward from Senegal, and that ere long we shall have to depore its outbreak at Bathurst and Sierra Leone. We do not wish to spread alarm, but we do wish that the imminence of the peril may impel the Colonial authorities to adopt and enforce without delay all possible sanitary precautions. The accounts we have lately received of flagrant inattention as regards this important matter by the authorities at Bathurst and Sierra Leone, who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of attending to it, are of a nature to deepen our alarm when we hear of Yellow Fever in the neighbourhood. All ordinary reasoning would have justified us in believing that when Her Majesty\'s Government adopted for Bathurst and Sierra Leone the most unusual, if not unprecedented, course of entrusting the local administration to gentlemen of the Army Medical Department, they had at least done what would insure that due attention would be given to sanitary measures. How are we to account for the result not having justified our belief? It cannot be that there were supreme orders that ""no money should be spent"" on what is so vital not only to the prosperity, but to the continued existence of British settlements on the West Coast; and if it be not owing to this, we say it with all proper respect for authorities appointed by the Queen, it cannot be otherwise accounted for than that these authorities are totally unfitted for the responsible posts entrusted to them. Should the Yellow Fever, and the virulent small-pox, its ordinary accompaniment on the West Coast, visit the settlements, their ravages cannot fail to be aggravated by that neglect of sanitary precautions of which complaint is continually reaching us; and the authorities, who have neglected those precautions, although they may not be made criminally liable, as they will have deserved, will at least incur a moral responsibility which may well overwhelm them, if their long familiarity with human sufferings under various diseases shall not have destroyed all ordinary feelings of humanity within their bosoms. We hope these observations from our pen will reach these authorities before the fearful visitants make their appearance; and that all past neglect will be atoned for by an activity as ardent as their apathy has been torpid. We call on all the authorities down the Coast, from Bathurst to Lagos—on all the masters of trading hulks at Bonny, Benin, New and Old Calabar, and Cameroons, and the heads of all trading stations on the South-west Coast, to commence without delay all possible sanitary measures. The Spanish Governor of Fernando Po would act wisely in taking similar precautions. Should the dreaded malady not spread southward from Senegal—as we fervently hope, but cannot believe will be the case—nothing will have been lost by the activity and expense that may have been made and exhibited. Sanitary measures, if properly conceived and carried into execution, must always be productive of benefit to the general health in the absence of virulent epidemics, as well as being influential in arresting and mitigating the spread and intensity of these when they do make their appearance. Among the blessings of British rule ought most certainly to be included a comparative immunity from epidemical diseases, owing to the adoption and enforcement of sanitary regulations; and it is time that efforts be really made in the British settlements on the West Coast to remove the natural stimulating agents of disease, and by sanitary police regulations put an end to all that filthiness which is represented to us as making the atmosphere of many of the Coast towns repulsively sickening and almost unbearable. Lessons in cleanliness are lessons in civilization; and there can be no reason that we know of why Sierra Leone, Bathurst, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos should not be made at least as healthy as Calcutta, Madras, and', 'last_edit_date': '1878-09-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_09_1878#article-11', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'M\'Carthy\'s Island, River Gambia, Dec. 20, 1864.\n\nMy Lord,—In the editorial article in the Lancet of October 13, page 442, we find the remark that ""it is a singular fact in medical geography that from St. Louis, Senegal, on the north, to Mossamedes, on the south, there is not upon the seaboard a single healthy acre of ground. The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': '### EPIDEMIC ON THE AFRICAN COAST.\n\n**February 11.**—Information has been received in Liverpool this morning of a serious outbreak of small-pox at Bathurst, British Gambia, and also that quarantine restrictions are again in force at Goree, Senegal.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE YELLOW FEVER AT SAVANNAH.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""We do not remember that what may be called the unintentional evils that may result from the frequent and reiterated publication of falsehood ever before impressed us so strongly, as when we heard of the fearful outbreak of Yellow Fever at Savannah, where it has been carrying off its hecatombs of victims.

The Danish Island of St. Thomas may be said to have been the birthplace of Lamplough's Pyretic Saline. Dr. Stevens, who was a medical practitioner in the Island, saw year after year the people dying around him, and probably not a few while under his own then imperfect treatment.

It was well known that the majority of European residents on the Coast sooner or later became attacked by African fever in one form or another, and even those who merely visited the coast ran risk of being attacked, especially if they were over forty years of age, or were in a low or depressed state. They were also aware that when in the malignant form—""black water fever""—under the present method of treatment the majority of those attacked died. This melancholy state of matters was almost daily brought home to them by the loss, if not of relations or friends, at least of officials, such as captains, managers, clerks, and others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, that they should be dissatisfied with the present mode of treatment, and inquire if it was not possible for some improvement to be inaugurated in this respect. Of course the question arose—could the method of medical practice called homœopathic effect any better results? He unhesitatingly said it could, and he spoke after an experience of 35 years in homœopathic practice, preceded by 15 years\' experience in ordinary or allopathic practice. He based this assertion on the published results of the two methods of treatment in the most severe diseases and the worst forms of malignant malarial fever. Unfortunately there were not any practitioners on the coast sufficiently familiar with the resources of homœopathy to be able to demonstrate this on the spot, but it had been shown over and over again in the malignant malarial fevers of tropical and sub-tropical America and India, where similar fevers were much the same as in the regions of Africa; and there the mortality under homœopathic treatment was not one-third that under ordinary treatment. When the mortality in yellow fever under ordinary treatment was about 70 per cent of those attacked, that under homœopathic treatment was about 20 per cent, and in mild epidemics less than 1 per cent. Moreover, statistics showed that the convalescence was much shorter and the recovery more complete. This was because the patients had not been severely drugged with quinine, calomel, or other strong poisons. He had, therefore, the greatest confidence in endeavouring to induce the African Section of the Chamber of Commerce to do its utmost to have missionaries and captains of vessels furnished with homœopathic medicines and directions, and to have homœopathic treatment introduced into the settlements on the coast. With about two dozen one-ounce bottles of homœopathic medicines and a few pages of directions, an intelligent missionary or captain would be able to effect much better results than an ordinary ship\'s doctor with the Government manual and chest of medicines, and to save many valuable lives that would otherwise be lost. It was not only in malarial fevers that the superiority of homœopathic treatment was to be seen. It was the same in dysentery, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, sunstroke, pleurisy, pneumonia, bronchitis, and all other severe diseases. By doing their utmost to enable residents on the coast to obtain homœopathic treatment, the African Section of the Chamber would add another to the many and great services they had already rendered to Africa, and would earn the blessings of future victims of African fevers.', 'last_edit_date': '1896-12-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/05_12_1896#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}]",True
1638,Colonial neglect and inadequate medical care in Africa led to preventable suffering and deaths among the local population.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide compelling evidence supporting the claim that colonial neglect and inadequate medical care in Africa led to preventable suffering and deaths among the local population. The textbook highlights the gross inadequacy and uneven distribution of social services, including healthcare, which were primarily designed for the benefit of European settlers and administrators. For instance, in Nigeria during the 1930s, there were only fifty-two hospitals for over 40 million Africans compared to twelve hospitals for 4,000 Europeans, and in Tanganyika, the ratio of hospital beds for Europeans was significantly higher than for Africans. The colonial powers further exacerbated the situation by cutting back on health expenditures during the 1930s depression. High mortality rates among African laborers, who were exposed to new diseases and suffered from malnutrition and poor sanitary conditions, underscore the lack of adequate medical care. The African Times articles add to this narrative by highlighting instances of neglect by colonial medical officials, such as the case of Dr. Spilsbury, the Colonial Surgeon, who failed to properly attend to a patient, leading to near-death, only for the patient to be saved by a local druggist, Mr. Stapleton. The overburdening of colonial medical staff with multiple roles hindered their ability to provide effective care, while poor sanitary conditions in towns like Cape Coast contributed to the spread of diseases like smallpox and yellow fever. The articles also criticize the lack of preventive measures, such as vaccination, and the failure to employ native African medical practitioners who could have provided more consistent care. Together, these details illustrate a pattern of colonial neglect and inadequate medical infrastructure, aligning with the claim of preventable suffering and deaths among the African population.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that colonial neglect and inadequate medical care in Africa led to preventable suffering and deaths among the local population.

Rodney has shown that in Nigeria in the 1930s whereas there were twelve modern hospitals for 4000 Europeans in the country, there were only fifty-two for Africans numbering over 40 million.$^{34}$ In Tanganyika by 1920, the ratio of beds to population was approximately 1:10 for the European Hospital and 1:400-500 for the African Hospital in Dar es Salaam. 35 In the field of education, what was provided during the colonial days was grossly inadequate, unevenly distributed and badly orientated and therefore not as beneficial as it could have been for Africa. Five different types of educational institutions were established under colonial rule: primary, secondary, teacher-training, technical and university. But while many primary schools had been established by i860 in British West Africa, it was not until 1876 that the first secondary schools, Mfantsipim and the Methodist High School, were established in the Gold Coast and Nigeria respectively, both by the Wesleyan Missionary Society, while the British colonial administration did not establish its first secondary school (Achimota College) in the Gold Coast until 1927. In the Italian colony of Libya, as it has been pointed out already, there were only three secondary schools for the Libyans by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi. It was not until after the Second World War that technical schools and univer› sity colleges were established in most parts of Africa. And significantly, only one university college each was established in the Gold Coast in 1947, in Nigeria in 1948, in Uganda in 1950, in Senegal and Madagascar in 1950, in Salisbury in 1953, in Congo Leopoldville in 1954 and Elizabethville in 1956.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

The labourers were often shifted to areas which exposed them to new diseases; but in addition Africans apparently immune to malaria in their home areas developed not only virulent malaria in distant areas but even blackwater fever.$^{61}$ Some of the migrant labourers did not observe the careful sanitary arrangements which exist widely in Africa, especially defecation in areas outside the village and away from streams$^{62}$ thereby polluting their water supplies and spreading dysentery and the newly introduced diseases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever.

By the end of the 1920s most of the railway system had been built and roads were improving; by the late 1930s lorries in limited numbers were reaching almost every part of the continent. This system made it possible for food to be sent by governments or traders to famine areas. The very existence of a transport network together with a currency acceptable over great distances encouraged the production of a surplus of food for the market. From about 1920 famine deaths, relative to the size of the rainfall deficit, fell consistently, and the great mortality peaks, which kept up the average level of mortality, began to be under major attack. Until that time, even countries like Uganda could experience over a hundred thousand famine deaths in a single year, as it apparently did in 1918-19. 72 Missionaries probably had a small but real impact on mortality, quite apart from the setting up of hospitals. One authority argues that 'their pupils imbibed ... at least some sense of mastery over the new conditions of life created by the colonial system'. 73 Finally, what effect did western medicine have on Africa? The short answer is that, apart from emergency measures against certain epidemics, the meagre services that did exist were concentrated mainly on saving Europeans until the First World War; thereafter services became progres› sively available for African labourers who were still justifiably regarded as the chief source of wealth in Africa, while mass medicine was hardly attempted before the middle of the present century. That little more could be attempted by the medical services is shown by the fact that as late as 1939 they were awarded an annual budget of only two shillings per head in the Gold Coast and five pence in Nigeria. 74 The diseases to which the population were subject were awesome. As late as the 1930s, it was reported of conditions in Kampala that: 'Every patient attending for treatment is a latent or active subject of malaria, and harbours one or more varieties of helminths. From 50 to 80 per cent have or have had syphilis or yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm,"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""yaws or both, and the same is true of gonorrhoea, while leprosy, spirillum fever and dysentery, among other diseases, are far from rare.'$^{75}$ The helminths included hookworm, Ascaris infections, schistosomiasis, filariasis and Guinea worm. To these must be added such epidemic diseases as yellow fever, smallpox and sleeping sickness (try› panosomiasis) and the new imports like tuberculosis and cholera. Until near the end of the nineteenth century, Europeans were far more likely to succumb to indigenous diseases, as is evidenced by the death rates early in the century among British West African forces which were nine times as great among the European as among the African soldiers. 76 Europe was not medically well equipped for its African ventures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Britain's expectation of life at birth was less than 40 years; while, by the end, those of Britain, France and Germany had reached about 47 years with death rates close to 20 per thousand and infant mortality rates near to 200.$^{77}$ Furthermore, the medical revolution was late in turning its attention to tropical disease. Although smallpox vaccination had been known since the eighteenth century (largely because the disease was not a specifically tropical one), even the methods of transmission of elephantiasis, malaria, and yellow fever were established only in 1877,1897 and 1900 respectively. Apart from quinine, and a limited use of arsenical compounds against syphilis and yaws, the development of drugs and vaccines to combat tropical diseases really dates only from the 1920s. Nevertheless, tropical medical schools were established in Europe as early as 1897 in Liverpool and London, 1900 in Hamburg, 1901 in Brussels, followed later by Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles, and in Africa by 1912 in Cape Town and 1918 in Dakar."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.732, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the economic field', 'content': ""The heavy reliance on cash crops had another disastrous effect, which was the negligence of the internal sector of the economy of Africa. The economy of Africa had always been divided, as M. H. Y. Kaniki has pointed out above (Chapter 16), into two major sectors - the internal sector which produced both for the subsistence of producers and for the home market and the export sector which catered for the long-distance and caravan trade. Both sectors were given equal emphasis in pre-colonial times with the result that neither food nor fish was imported to feed anyone. However, because of the concentration on the production of cash crops during the colonial era, the internal sector was virtually neglected and Africans were in fact compelled to ignore the production of food for their own consumption in favour of the production of cash crops for export even where, as Fieldhouse has observed, it was uneconomic to do so.$^{24}$ Food therefore had to be imported which the ordinary people had to buy, usually at high prices, to feed themselves. This, for instance, was what happened in The Gambia where the Gambians were made to abandon the cultivation of rice in favour of the production of groundnuts, and rice therefore had to be imported.$^{25}$ In Guinea, Africans in the Futa Jallon area were com› pelled to produce rubber which led to a shortage of rice in 1911. Rice therefore had to be imported and bought with the money earned from rubber. Egypt, which for centuries exported grains and foodstuffs, was compelled to import maize and wheat from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards owing to her excessive concentration on the production of cotton for export. The same thing happened in the Gold Coast where cocoa production was so much emphasized that foodstuffs had to be imported. This is evident from the lament of A. W. Cardinall, one of the sympathetic colonial officials in the 1930s, that the country could have itself produced half 'the fresh fish, rice, maize, and other meal, beans, salted and fresh meat, edible oils, spices and fresh vegetables [imported], or in other words would have saved 200000 pounds'.$^{26}$ It was this neglect of food production coupled with forced labour which caused so much malnutrition, severe famine and epidemics in some parts of Africa during the early colonial days, especially in the areas of French Africa, as C.

AndrØ Gide, visiting health facilities at BØtou on the Oubangui river in the late 1920s, commented scathingly that the only supplies received to combat the diseases of Middle Africa were iodine, boracic acid, and Glauber's salts. 84 The major reduction in African mortality (certainly in the period covered by this chapter) has probably been achieved by attacking the periodic peaks in mortality caused by famine and epidemic disease. Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.685, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Smallpox vaccination was on such a small scale that by the late 1930s a significant reduction of the disease had probably taken place only in the Gold Coast and southern Nigeria. 93 In contrast, contact with Europeans and participation in the First World War ensured that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 swept through Africa probably resulting in the highest annual death rate this century, although the rise in death rates was probably not as great as in Asia, for many African populations were still protected by comparative isolation. Death rates were still enormous in the mines of Southern Africa in the early years of the present century; a 1907 commission reporting on the situation in Transvaal drew attention to death rates in the mines at the time of 71 per thousand for tropical Africans compared with 28 for Africans from the temperate south and 19 for whites, the rates having declined from 130, 35 and 20 respectively two years earlier.$^{94}$ In most of the continent little progress had been made against the greatest scourge of all, malaria, which weakened when it did not kill and explained many deaths attributed to other causes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.052, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'A fragile population emerging from near stability', 'content': 'This picture is not in any way surprising.

Given the mortality levels described above (which is a conservative assumption in view of the fact that the health conditions of the forests of the west coast equatorial area have probably long been worse than elsewhere), the conclu› sion could be drawn that in the centuries past those areas averaging 5 births per woman had experienced population declines averaging over 0.5 per cent per annum, and those averaging 3.5 children declines of over 1.5 per cent per annum.

Lugard laid much stress on this, claiming that Nigeria's more deserted areas were evidence of periodic devastation.$^{48}$ Certainly there was some insecurity in pre-colonial Africa, as is evidenced by the defensive location of many villages from which 'downhill movements' of farmers to better agricultural locations occurred after their safety could be guaranteed. 49 The claim of greater security was true in the long run but highly questionable during the first decades. African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought. The object of much of the raiding was not people but cattle and grain,$^{50}$ although without question the owners of such property ran risks in protecting it. What was less frequently emphasized by the new regimes was the heavy loss of life arising in parts of Africa from their intervention. The deaths were rarely a product of the original extension of administration, but rather of the suppression of subsequent revolts and of the ensuing punitive expeditions which apparently often inflicted most damage because of starvation resulting from the upsetting of the subsistence farming cycle. Examples include the thousands killed in Senegal in 1886 when opposing the building of a railway$^{51}$ and in the Ndebele war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1893, the long-drawn-out suppression of the BÆtetela rebellion in the Congo Free State from 1895 to 1907, and a series of episodes in German South West Africa (now Namibia) between 1901 and 1906.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten. In Uganda, where sleeping sickness was first identified in 1901, it was held to have caused over 200000 deaths by 1906 when the large population transfers began; but by 1918 there was sufficient confidence that the disease was being contained to allow some people to move back to their old areas.$^{88}$ Outbreaks of bubonic plague were far from rare in the first third of the present century: in the first decade Egypt reported 6000 cases of whom half died; 89 almost 60000 deaths had been recorded in Uganda up to 1932;$^{90}$ and there were outbreaks in Accra in 1908, Lagos in 1924 and more generally in Yoruba areas of Nigeria in 1925.$^{91}$ Control measures in British West Africa indicated that the disease could be contained; during the Accra out› break the town had been sealed off and 35 000 doses of Haffkine's vaccine were administered. Yellow fever epidemics have occurred from Senegal to Sudan at unpredictable intervals. By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

Epidemics of both smallpox and cholera ravaged large portions of the region stretching from the presentday Tanzania-Malawi border to southern Mozambique. In the late 1850s one European explorer noted that 'The most dangerous epidemic is ... small-pox which ... sweeps at times like a storm over the land.'$^{57}$ Docu› mented epidemics of smallpox swept parts of Mozambique in 1834, 1836 and 1862, and were reported in the interior throughout the period from 1850 to 1880.$^{58}$ Sleeping sickness, probably related to changes in the disease environment as a result of forest clearance and the hunting of game, also struck much of the area under investigation. 59 The high mortality and its debilitating effects further reduced rural productivity which, in turn, intensified the spiral of malnourishment and disease. The tendency of surviving communities to relocate in overcrowded stockaded villages, whose soils proved incapable of supporting them, further aggravated this problem. The epidemics had at least two other disruptive effects. Evidence suggests that they led to a sharp increase in witchcraft accusations and social upheavals. There are also suggestions that the privileged in a number of societies sought additional captives to compensate for demographic losses, thereby further augmenting the intensity of the slave trade. 60 While it might be argued that African trading societies, or at least the aristocracy and merchants within them, benefited at the expense of their weaker neighbours, the evidence suggests that the advantages which these groups enjoyed were short-term and made them excessively dependent on the capitalist world economy. At a minimum, the great commercial states lost their economic autonomy. To maintain their pre-eminent positions they had to expect not only that the coastal demand for ivory and slaves would continue despite growing British pressures, but also that they could acquire sufficient supplies of both commodities. In extreme cases, such as the Makua, the failure to maintain the external supply of slaves resulted in internal conflict and self-destruction.

In East, Central and Southern Africa, as has been shown in many of the earlier chapters, it also led to large-scale appropriation of land by Europeans.

Even as it was, the white population of the continent had increased thirty times from 25000 in 1800, found mostly in the Cape, to three-quarters of a million in 1880, of whom five-sixths were in South Africa, Algeria and Egypt.

Caldwell has shown (Chapter 18), after its decline during the first two or three decades of colonialism. This increase, according to Caldwell, was due to the establishment of an economic base, the spread of roads and railways which ensured the rushing of food to famine areas, and the campaigns launched against epidemic diseases such as sleeping sickness, bubonic plague and yellow fever.\nClosely connected with this and the second social impact of colonialism was urbanization. As A. E. Afigbo has emphasized (Chapter 19), urban› ization was of course not unknown in pre-colonial Africa. The kingdoms and empires of Africa had such capitals or political centres as Kumbi Saleh, Benin, Ile-Ife, Kumasi, Gao and Great Zimbabwe; such commercial centres as Kano, Jenne, Sofala and Malindi, and such educational centres as Timbuktu, Cairo and Fez. But there is no doubt that as a result of colonial› ism, the pace of urbanization was greatly accelerated.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.66, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

The Prisoner pleaded ""Not guilty."" He was defended by Mr. James Brew. The substance of the case was simply this: The prisoner was the Chief Landing Waiter of Her Majesty\'s Customs here. On Sunday, the 27th of October, the prisoner sent for his assistant, named Hilton, by a little boy of his. The boy did not see Hilton, but saw the deceased, Jim, who was servant to Hilton, and he delivered his message to the Krooboy that his master, Hagan, wanted Hilton. The Krooboy told him that his master was asleep, and he would not wake him. An altercation took place, in which the deceased Krooboy pushed Hagan\'s boy, and he returned back to his master crying; whereupon the prisoner Hagan at once, in a violent rage, which he always exhibited to the helpless and the weak, sent a big slave servant of his, named Hebbit, to go at once to fetch both Hilton and this poor Krooboy to him immediately, which he did. As soon as they entered his house, Hagan at once commenced, with a good-sized horsewhip, to flog and beat this poor Krooboy on the top of the stairs, and followed up the beating down the stairs whilst the Krooboy was trying to run away from him. In running down the steps his foot slipped, and he fell downstairs, and Hagan still continued to beat him unmercifully, till the boy\'s back and sides were cut open and blood gushing out freely. This outrage was done in the presence of Hilton, the Krooboy\'s master, on that holy day. Hilton asked Hagan, ""What has my boy done to you that you should give him such a beating?"" He replied, ""He assaulted my boy when I sent him to call you."" The Krooboy ran away to his countrymen and friends, and told them what Hegan had done to him, and told them that in falling downstairs he had hurt his ribs. Then he returned to his master\'s house, and told the same tale to Hilton\'s wife; and from that time the boy never ate anything, his appetite being gone. But Hilton was afraid that if he sent the Krooboy to the Colonial Hospital he should involve his superior officer. He therefore endeavoured to hide this matter from the authorities, and did his best to save Hagan, by sending him to fetch his meals to the beach the next morning and the following. On Wednesday he was worse; they tried to get him to eat, but he complained of pains in his side and chest, and yet no medical advice was given him. But on Wednesday evening, finding he was getting worse, Hilton\'s wife gave the boy some native medicine used for asthmatic complaints. About midnight of that day he called out to his master, and while his master held him he died. The next morning, Thursday, they found blood gushing out from his mouth and nose, and some other matter. Instead of Hilton reporting the matter to the District Commissioner, he went to Hagan, the prisoner, to tell him that the Krooboy was dead, meaning that his cruel act had taken effect, and asked what he should do. The result of that interview was, that this Krooboy was privately hurried to the grave; and this would have been the last of it. The true cause of his death would never have been known by any person in this world, had it not been that the other Krooboys, who were indignant and in a great rage, got some kind friends, natives of Sierra Leone, to write a letter for them, reporting the circumstances, to the District Commissioner, who at once caused an inquiry to be made, and ordered the Acting Colonial Surgeon to have the poor boy\'s body exhumed, on Friday, the 1st instant, before a coroner and a jury. On a *post-mortem* examination they found the body in a high state of decomposition, so that Dr. Elliott stated that it was impossible to hold an examination, but he stated on his oath before the Court, that he saw abrasions upon his body, and that the horsewhip produced in court, if severely used on the Krooboy, who was only eighteen years of age, was sufficient to cause the loss of appetite, and the symptoms on his body; and that death would be the result.'}, {'id': 3835, 'article_title': 'Yellow Fever at Senegal', 'full_section_title': 'Yellow Fever at Senegal', 'last_edit_date': '08-14-1879', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1879#article-4', 'issue_date': '01_09_1879', 'content': 'Sir,—Yellow fever has broken out at Rufisque, in Senegal, near Goree; it is in a virulent form.

The filthy condition of that town, fully exposed in late numbers of this journal, must without doubt tend to the increase of its severity, as well as to the number of attacks. A few years since (six, we believe), after great ravages of smallpox at Accra, when Dr. Gunn, who was at that time on the station, vaccinated a very considerable number of the native population, and thus, it was considered, did much to arrest the onward progress of the fatal disorder, we more than once called attention to the subject, in the hope that the British authorities in the settlements of this country on the Coast, would take some effectual measures for bringing the population gradually under that degree of protection which vaccination undoubtedly affords. We do not say what that degree is; but, looking at the European population in the present day, with their smooth, unmarked faces, we find they present so marked a contrast to those of the generation passed away, as to establish beyond dispute that the degree is a very considerable one. It is, therefore, greatly to be regretted that our self-martyrising, zealous Administrators on the West Coast, while ""wearing themselves to the very verge of the grave"" in their arduous exertions for the good of the native population, have not paid more attention to this important matter of the employment of preventive means for arresting the spread of that terrible scourge of Africa—smallpox—among the native people. In another column we publish a short account of an experience in this matter in the East Indies, where the prejudice against, or rather disbelief in the benefit of vaccination, has far exceeded anything of the kind experienced in Africa. Indeed, Dr. Gunn assured us at the time of the Accra outbreak, the people came willingly and with strong expressions of gratitude to obtain the protection (then proved in their eyes to be real) which vaccination affords. Whether the self-made Martyr Administrator of Cape Coast returns there, or some other aspirant martyr be sent out, we beg once again to express the hope that, by the formation of a vaccine institution, or by giving a fee per head to the Army and Colonial Surgeons for every child or adult properly and effectively vaccinated by them, or by some other active and dependable means, the native population in the future may be less exposed to the ravages of smallpox than it has been in the past. The records of travellers and explorers establish incontestably that smallpox is the great fatal disease of Africa. Among the great and precious benefits which European civilisation bestows on Africa, let this be one, that we make the results of our own experience instrumental in saving African lives from that fell destroyer.

It was a most distressing sight to witness the arrival of these poor creatures; and it is necessary to make a few preliminary remarks in order clearly to understand the difficulties with which the medical officers had to contend. The appearance of the slaves when landed was most striking. In some the expression of the countenance indicated sufferings, moral and physical, of the most profound and agonising nature. Others of them gazed vacantly around them in the most utter helplessness. Occasionally, among the newly-arrived groups all sense of suffering was merged in melancholic or raving madness. The wizened, shrunk, and skinny features were lighted up by the hollow, feverish eye. The belly was, as it were, tacked to the back, whilst the hip-bones protruded, and, in some cases, became the seat of foul, sloughing ulcers. The hand and skinny fingers seemed much elongated by the great and neglected growth of the nails, and they were so deplorably emaciated, that the skin appeared tensely stretched over, and tied down to the skeleton. The legs refused to perform their functions, and they reeled and tottered about from sheer debility. Their squalor and extreme wretchedness was heightened, in many cases, by the particoloured evacuations with which their bodies were besmeared. When large numbers of the sick were suffering from dysentery, the condition of the wards and yards in the morning was extremely loathsome. This was in a great degree unavoidable, as the sick were too weak to crawl from their mats to the commode, although everything was done under the surgeons\' orders to keep the wards as clean and wholesome as the crowded state of the hospital would admit of."" In a word, ""the moral and physical causes of depression were often so overwhelming, and so intensely concentrated, that the combination produced disease in such formidable shapes as to be beyond remedy. The mortality was consequently very great; many persons brought to the hospital in the last stage of disease died a few hours after their arrival; others even expired by the way.

This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it.

This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy.

The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'AFRICAN-AID SOCIETY.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The African-Aid Society addressed the following letter to the Right Honourable Earl de Grey and Ripon, President of the Educational Committee, &c., &c., under date 1st of February, 1864:—\n\nMy Lord,—The perfect immunity from yellow fever enjoyed by the native-born African, when this destructive epidemic is sweeping off the Europeans on the West Coast of Africa, has long been viewed by this Society as worthy of particular regard in questions of British Administration in Her Majesty's colonies, forts, and settlements on that Coast.\n\nIt seems particularly desirable that when an epidemic of so virulent and fatal a nature is raging, there should be no lack of medical assistance, as there unfortunately has often been in consequence of the deaths of European surgeons from yellow fever.\n\nIt having been fully established that native Africans are capable, if properly educated, of attaining such a degree of efficiency in surgery and medicine as entitles them to, and secures for them, the confidence and respect, not only of educated people of colour, but of eminent Europeans on the West Coast, the Society take the liberty of expressing their opinion that there can be no doubt as to the advisability and necessity of an adequate supply of properly qualified native African surgeons and physicians for service on the West Coast, by which the certainty of medical attendance for the sick at periods of violent epidemics, as well as at all other times, will be secured.\n\nThe Society having in view the many loathsome and destructive maladies which assist in depopulating Africa, and increasing the misery of its people, cannot avoid the further expression of their opinion that it is the duty of this Christian country, on the ground of common humanity alone, if on no other, to endeavour to qualify many natives of Africa in medicine and surgery, to supply the means of mitigating and removing much of that misery.\n\nMajesty's Government that a medical school for the educated natives of various parts of Africa should be established by Her Majesty's Government at Sierra Leone, in a great degree, if not entirely, under the direction and superintendence of competent medical men—natives of Africa—who have passed with success through the medical schools in Great Britain, and have since given proofs of efficiency in Her Majesty's service in Africa.\n\nThe Society has the honour to solicit for that suggestion the full and impartial consideration which Her Majesty's Government must naturally be disposed to give to a matter connected with an economy of valuable European life in Africa—an ultimate economy of money in the medical department of Her Majesty's service in Africa—and an effective application of the inestimable benefits of medical and surgical skill among the suffering multitudes of Africa, who are known to appreciate this result of our civilization whenever it is brought within their reach.\n\nOn behalf of the Council of the African-Aid Society,—I have the honour to remain, &c."", 'last_edit_date': '1864-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1864#article-14', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Dreadful Ravages of Cholera at Zanzibar, East Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dr. Kirk, in a letter from Zanzibar, dated February 7, 1870, says: ""There died here in this town alone upwards of 10,000 in one month and a half, and 30,000 in the whole island; now it rages up and down the coast.

The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.679, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MISSIONARY VICTIMS TO AFRICAN CLIMATE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The list of missionary victims to the climate in Africa will, we fear, be largely increased in the Eastern and Lake countries.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health. The day is past when patients were killed by bleeding and by calomel. The late outcry and ""furious attack,"" as you justly term it, is in a great measure originated and fostered by those who dislike the country as a station and their friends. This dislike is very natural in naval and military officers, who, frequently idle, must find time hang heavily on their hands; but why not be honest, and state the true grounds of their abuse of the country? When the slave-trade was brisk, and prizes and prize-money plentiful, naval men did not revile the ""Coast"" and climate as they now do.\n\nI perfectly agree with you that the Coast of Africa may be made at least as healthy as the West India Islands, aye, and more so. Yellow fever is not a frequent visitor on this Coast, and at many places it is fortunately unknown. Let Governors and Administrators imitate the example partially set them of late at Lagos and Cape Coast, and improve the sanitary condition of the places under their rule; and let the Europeans, instead of abusing the ""climate,"" adapt their habits to it, and there will soon be a vast diminution in the number of ""victims!""', 'last_edit_date': '1867-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1867#article-25', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.701, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}]",True
